<p><strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:14</a>:</strong>  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com slash course or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:14">0:00:14-0:00:25</a>:</strong>  Nitrogen and chemical fertilizer.  We don't talk about it a lot, but with energy prices at record levels in Europe and thus  the price of chemical fertilizer is directly tied to fossil fuel gas or quote unquote natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:25">0:00:25-0:00:32</a>:</strong>  gas.  This means record prices for fertilizer.  Last year plus 300% that is a three with two zeros.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:32">0:00:32-0:00:47</a>:</strong>  As it is an extremely potent greenhouse gas as well, we need to work with farmers to implement  regenerative practices and reduce our reliance on chemical fertilizer.  Our guest of today argues that we can do this by working through the banks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:47">0:00:47-0:00:58</a>:</strong>  Welcome to another episode of investing in regenerative agriculture investing as if the  planet mattered.  Podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:00:58">0:00:58-0:01:10</a>:</strong>  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:10">0:01:10-0:01:21</a>:</strong>  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  And it's time that we as investors big and small and consumers start paying much more<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:21">0:01:21-0:01:32</a>:</strong>  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:32">0:01:32-0:01:45</a>:</strong>  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&amp;A webinars with former  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.

<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:01:57">0:01:57-0:02:01</a>:</strong>  Welcome Kelly.  Hi, thanks for having me.  And we always start with this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:01">0:02:01-0:02:07</a>:</strong>  I mean, you're a listener of the podcast.  We start with this personal question.  How did you end up working on soil and regeneration?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:07">0:02:07-0:02:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's a great question.  I was a biologist by training and then had a career consulting in the pharmaceutical  industry, but I increasingly became concerned about the planet's health as opposed to humans<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:19">0:02:19-0:02:34</a>:</strong>  health and I really wanted to transition and use my background to focus on entrepreneurship  that would help the climate crisis.  And as a biologist, I know that soil is the foundation of everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:34">0:02:34-0:02:44</a>:</strong>  The only energy that we're harnessing on the planet for the most part is coming from plants,  which depend on soil.  So if we don't have soil health, we're not harnessing that energy and we won't be able<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:44">0:02:44-0:02:51</a>:</strong>  to feed ourselves.  So that's how I came to it.  And as a biologist, you mentioned, we know that soil is the foundation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:02:51">0:02:51-0:03:03</a>:</strong>  I don't know if all biologists, I mean, they should know, but they maybe don't.  Do you remember when that realization came?  Like, okay, it all starts with soil or oceans, obviously, depending on what we're eating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:03">0:03:03-0:03:10</a>:</strong>  But do you remember when that realization came and how was it a smaller process?  Was it a book?  Was it a movie?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:10">0:03:10-0:03:15</a>:</strong>  Was it a tomato you ate straight from the plant?  What was that trigger?  Yeah, well, you know, it's funny.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:15">0:03:15-0:03:30</a>:</strong>  It definitely wasn't from my biology courses, which, you know, I thought, wow, I'm a bit  late to the party here to be figuring this out well after university.  But it was reading Gabe Brown's book Dirt to Soil that really brought that light bulb<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:30">0:03:30-0:03:40</a>:</strong>  moment to me because that's when I had that aha of, oh, yeah, the soil is alive.  It's a living organism.  It's an ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:40">0:03:40-0:03:49</a>:</strong>  And that's what feeds the plants.  That plus sunlight.  And if we only have one half of that equation, we're not going to have healthy plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:49">0:03:49-0:03:56</a>:</strong>  And that was that epiphany for me.  And if we don't have healthy plants, we can't have healthy humans because we can't feed  ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:04:02</a>:</strong>  And I mean, I think many people be nodding now.  I say, okay, Gabe Brown, of course, I read the book as well.  It's super interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:02">0:04:02-0:04:07</a>:</strong>  But it's quite a niche book.  Like, you don't pick that up on an airport normally.  Like, how did that come to you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:18</a>:</strong>  How did somebody say you should really read this Dirt to Soil?  Like, what was the trigger to open that or to get that book or open a book of quite a  niche subject of a farmer in the US?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:18">0:04:18-0:04:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, this is kind of how did I come to focus on regenerative agriculture, which  is a whole other story.  But just to answer your question quickly, we have time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:27">0:04:27-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  We do have time.  It was watching the film Kiss the Ground, which he features in.  And that's what really got me understanding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:46</a>:</strong>  You know, I knew that there were problems with the food system from some previous work  I'd done in food waste.  But it was watching Kiss the Ground and understanding how we're killing the soil with the way we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:46">0:04:46-0:04:55</a>:</strong>  currently growing things that helped me get on this mental journey.  And then, of course, I picked up Gabe's book.  And I actually got to speak to Gabe a while back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:04:55">0:04:55-0:05:01</a>:</strong>  Wow.  And that was, yeah, that was a really great moment.  He honestly salted the earth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:01">0:05:01-0:05:08</a>:</strong>  Genuinely nice guy.  He took a call from me while he was just sitting at DFW Airport waiting for a flight.  He's that nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:08">0:05:08-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  Wow.  And then I've seen him speak virtually.  And that's the closest we got.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:27</a>:</strong>  But that was already fascinating.  Shout out to Jan Giesbert who might be listening, who's very close to Gabe as well.  I think it was at a small gathering we organized close to Berlin where he spoke virtually because<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:27">0:05:27-0:05:36</a>:</strong>  it was still COVID times.  So it's now, but he comes through even through a scream.  He comes through very, very warm and incredibly engaged in this topic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:36">0:05:36-0:05:45</a>:</strong>  So that's okay, that starts to make sense.  You see somebody like the entry point of a documentary.  I think they had an impact with that documentary, which has been quite astonishing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:45">0:05:45-0:05:57</a>:</strong>  And then picking up a book and going deeper.  And then you decided to found a company or to start working, like putting your working  energy and working hours and not just your thinking hours and maybe after work on this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:05:57">0:05:57-0:06:01</a>:</strong>  problem.  What was the first step you took there?  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:01">0:06:01-0:06:11</a>:</strong>  Well, I've always found in my career that I'm best when I'm able to funnel a passion.  And in my previous career in pharmaceuticals that was helping cancer patients and I really,  really enjoyed that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:11">0:06:11-0:06:25</a>:</strong>  But as I said, when I became more concerned about the planet, I wanted to pivot to entrepreneurship  that would help the climate crisis.  And of course, with a background in biology, I was drawn to things in that area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:25">0:06:25-0:06:41</a>:</strong>  And I had worked briefly at various climate tech startups working in the food space.  One was a company called Winnow that was helping to reduce food waste using AI and computer  vision, which was a great experience and helped me understand how much waste we have in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:48</a>:</strong>  system, which is just really terrible.  Yeah.  When you see it, I mean, you're saying with visuals, it's when you see the food waste<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:48">0:06:48-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  is very different when you hear 30, 40%.  We're like, oh, 30, 40%.  That's like massive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:06:54">0:06:54-0:07:06</a>:</strong>  But when you see like how much, and I think this company is mostly based on restaurants  or the, and they like, it's just the sheer quantity through imagery is you cannot see  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:06">0:07:06-0:07:11</a>:</strong>  But Kelly's closing her eyes and remembering the sheer quantity of the mountains of food  waste.  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:11">0:07:11-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  Now that triggers something.  Yeah.  And just a little bit about that, you know, there's the amount that we're wasting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  And then when you think about all of the energy and chemical inputs that went into growing  that food and transporting that food, and then you think about how that food, if thrown  into a landfill, but turns into methane, which is 30 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  gas, then you just really, your jaw starts dropping, doesn't it?  All that waste, it's mind boggling.  And still, I mean, you're working with cancer patients and you're working in food waste.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:55</a>:</strong>  These are big, hairy problems to talk, you can work your full career in that, but you  decided to start focusing on soil and farmers and the transition to more regenerative practices  or practices that have a regenerative outcome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:07:55">0:07:55-0:08:04</a>:</strong>  What led you down that path?  What led you to, because with Winnow, you could probably work for the next 20, 30 years.  There's no issue there whatsoever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:09</a>:</strong>  Like food waste is going to be there for a while, unfortunately.  Yeah, you're exactly right.  It is a big, hairy problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:09">0:08:09-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  And in fact, that's what they call it in Winnow.  And I think, you know, work can be stressful no matter what you're doing.  And I think that I found that if I'm working on something I really care about, it's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:19">0:08:19-0:08:27</a>:</strong>  stressful because it's good kind of stress, right?  You don't mind working hard when you know it's something that's really important to  me really care about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:27">0:08:27-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  And so as I got more into the problem of food waste and the food system, I started understanding  about the problems we face in the production side of things.  I thought about all that energy that was going into growing it and that was then wasted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:53</a>:</strong>  And that, and I worked with a company called Trident Supply, which is trying to get sustainable  growers matched with restaurants here in the UK.  And I learned more about the supply chain side of it and how difficult it is to source<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:08:53">0:08:53-0:09:04</a>:</strong>  sustainable produce.  And so that further informed it.  And then I had a little detour working for a clean fintech company, which further informed<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:04">0:09:04-0:09:19</a>:</strong>  that the solution we came to agreed.  But that company was basically trying to help create investment vehicles for decarbonization  tools because right now, if you want to put your money in a good way, like an ESG fund,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:19">0:09:19-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  there's myriad funds out there to choose from.  If you peel back the wrapper, you find that most of the companies in that fund are the  same ones, the usual suspects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:37</a>:</strong>  They're banks, financial services and tech companies like Google because they have a  lower carbon footprint.  They're doing less harm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:37">0:09:37-0:09:42</a>:</strong>  Directly, yeah.  The scope one and two is a lot lower.  It's the easy ones, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:42">0:09:42-0:09:50</a>:</strong>  But nobody's tackling the difficult ones.  Exactly, exactly.  Nobody's tackling the real source of the problem and coming up with solutions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:50">0:09:50-0:09:59</a>:</strong>  And so I wanted to create something that was actually becoming one of those solutions to  help draw down carbon and really help fix the system itself rather than just do less  bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:09:59">0:09:59-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  So that was the thinking behind it.  The actual impetus was I did a program through Cambridge and their Sustainability Leadership  Institute on sustainable business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:22</a>:</strong>  And I learned about this program called Carbon13.  It was a new venture builder for the climate crisis that they were creating.  And they were going to create companies to draw down carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:22">0:10:22-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  And I thought, this is it.  I worked for and with startups.  I want to start my own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:37</a>:</strong>  And it was a vehicle to meet like-minded founders who are also passionate about the climate  crisis and using entrepreneurship to solve it.  And so I joined that program.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:37">0:10:37-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  It was last, I think, middle of March, and we were the first cohort.  And it was very interesting and exciting because we started during COVID, during lockdown here  in the UK.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:11:05</a>:</strong>  So we had to meet people on Zoom and do everything by Zoom.  And the program, you could kind of liken it to Love Island meets Dragon's Den because  it took from 600 applicants, 60 individuals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:05">0:11:05-0:11:19</a>:</strong>  And then we were supposed to meet each other and team.  And then those teams had to come up with business ideas that would draw down 10 million tons  of CO2 with their business practices and then work on those ideas and then pitch to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:19">0:11:19-0:11:31</a>:</strong>  dragons at the end for funding.  And so during the teaming, it was meeting people on Zoom, kind of like trying to decide  to financially marry somebody when you've never actually met in real life, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:31">0:11:31-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  interesting.  Sounds tricky.  Yeah, definitely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:35">0:11:35-0:11:43</a>:</strong>  And then teams formed and then there was intrigue and teams broke up and you're like, is this  person with this team or that team?  We don't know what's going on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:43">0:11:43-0:11:55</a>:</strong>  So that was kind of the Love Island excitement of it.  And then 23 teams eventually formed and pitched for funding and eight went on to receive that  funding and we were one of the eight.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:12:06</a>:</strong>  And so it was a really great adventure.  This is a dangerous question to ask because things in Startup Live, as you said, we're  recording this actually in February 2022 and you started in March 21.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:06">0:12:06-0:12:18</a>:</strong>  So we're even less than a year in.  And I've followed this since November last year, so for like three months, four months.  And it's already, I wouldn't say changed dramatically, but changed over time and morphed into something<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:18">0:12:18-0:12:23</a>:</strong>  else.  And so I'm going to ask a dangerous question, which might be irrelevant when we put this  out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:23">0:12:23-0:12:30</a>:</strong>  But if you're listening to this in three years, it might be a bit different.  But what is agreed at the moment?  Like what are you if you had to, I mean, you're doing your fundraising, so you're doing this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:38</a>:</strong>  elevator pitch 6,000 times probably.  If you had to explain agreed in a few sentences and we have more than a few sentences because  I will be asking follow up questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:38">0:12:38-0:12:44</a>:</strong>  But what would you what would you say you are at the moment?  We're in February 2022.  I love that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:44">0:12:44-0:12:49</a>:</strong>  And I always ask the question back for the elevator pitch.  Well how tall is the building?  Very tall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:49">0:12:49-0:12:52</a>:</strong>  We're in London.  It's like we have a few minutes.  Is it the Shard?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:52">0:12:52-0:12:55</a>:</strong>  Are we in the Shard?  Yeah, it's definitely.  Great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:12:55">0:12:55-0:13:05</a>:</strong>  And the answer is very simple.  We're mission focused and our mission is to accelerate the transition to regenerative  agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:05">0:13:05-0:13:16</a>:</strong>  And so as long as we keep our eyes on the prize and we're in love with the problem,  the solution follows.  We're not focused on a solution that we're trying to shoehorn into a particular problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:16">0:13:16-0:13:30</a>:</strong>  And so that's why it's evolved over time because as we focus on this problem, we understand  more and more about what would actually move the needle.  And so just kind of taking a step back, my team, there's three of us, myself, my co-founder<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:30">0:13:30-0:13:43</a>:</strong>  Sarah who comes from a farming background and has an expertise in behavior science.  Always nice to have somebody with a farming background on the team.  And always like the technical decks I get and I'm scrolling very quickly to the team<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:43">0:13:43-0:13:53</a>:</strong>  page and think, okay, none of them has visited a farm recently.  It's tricky.  But I think Robin O'Brien of Replant Capital says, yeah, we'll just delete the deck.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:13:53">0:13:53-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  Maybe she didn't say that, but she definitely said the amount of technology companies I  see in Silicon Valley that have not visited a farm recently at all raised an insane amount  of money, burned most of it because yeah, they were searching for a problem with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:13</a>:</strong>  tool they had, with the solution they had.  So okay, sorry, go ahead.  But anyway, your co-founder has a very concrete farming background, which is great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:13">0:14:13-0:14:23</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah, no, it's great because she keeps us real.  You know, my co-founder Reed who comes from a tech background and I'll say something,  she's like, do you know what a farmer would say to that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:23">0:14:23-0:14:26</a>:</strong>  She's great.  Yeah.  We, you're a laptop farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:26">0:14:26-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah, me too.  Yeah, completely.  I'm Farmville basically compared to her, you know, Excel spreadsheet farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  Spreadsheet farmer compared to her muddy boots.  So it's really great to have that perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  And like I said, she keeps it real and she helps us understand the farmer mindset so  that we're starting where they are as opposed to trying to run to catch them and make them  see things our way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:15:06</a>:</strong>  And then my co-founder Reed comes from engineering tech background.  He commercialized weather data, satellite weather data for NASA and then had a lovely  career pivot as many of us do and founded his own craft rum distillery, as he likes<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:06">0:15:06-0:15:16</a>:</strong>  to say his fun fact is he's an international award winning rum distiller.  But that's where he learned about the sustainability issues and sourcing through the supply chain  and really got interested in agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:16">0:15:16-0:15:35</a>:</strong>  So the three of us came from different directions but coalesced on this passion for agriculture,  not only because it's such a source of emissions around one fourth of the world's greenhouse  gases, but because it's such a solution, a potential sink with so many co-benefits and<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:35">0:15:35-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  a way we probably still want to keep eating.  And if we do, we need to change things.  So that's why we focused on this mission and we're very passionate about helping farmers<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:16:00</a>:</strong>  because as we see it, farmers are stuck in a system.  They really, it's hard to get out of.  They have been conditioned by the markets, by the CPGs, by us, by the companies chasing<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:00">0:16:00-0:16:13</a>:</strong>  cheap food products and everything to chase yield almost at all costs.  And I mean financial costs and I mean environmental cost.  And mental costs, social costs as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:13">0:16:13-0:16:21</a>:</strong>  If we look at the countryside everywhere around the world, just picking on the UK, it's not  going amazingly.  No, no, no.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:21">0:16:21-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  They're literally being run into the ground.  Sorry, there's so many puns that one can do in ag.  It's a little dangerous, but they are by the system and the system needs to change and<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:41</a>:</strong>  that's difficult.  System change is very difficult.  So in systems change, you want to look at that the easiest off-ramp you can possibly,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:41">0:16:41-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  even not ramp, it should be a tiny off-road that is very easy to take.  I mean, a friend of the show, Jeroen Krompoh, likes to say, it's a very Dutch analogy, but  you're sort of stuck with your bicycle in a tram track.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:17:04</a>:</strong>  If you've never been on a bicycle in a tram city, you don't know what I mean, but you  can imagine if you're stuck with your little wheel in that tram track, you're going to  follow the tram because if you move left or right, if you try to steer, if you even try<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:04">0:17:04-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  to have some kind of agency, you'll fall over.  So that's where most farmers are because of all of us and not because we want them  to be there or they want to be there, but because they ended up there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:24</a>:</strong>  So the question is how do we get the wheel out of the tram track in the least disruptive,  painful revolution way?  Because that's probably not what we want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:24">0:17:24-0:17:35</a>:</strong>  No, no, exactly.  The last thing we want is a whole bunch of our farmers who are some of the best stewards  of the land to then go out of business and maybe have to sell their land to developers<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:35">0:17:35-0:17:50</a>:</strong>  who will just build a bunch of flats or whatever.  So we really want to help them stay in business sustainably, both financially and ecologically.  And we did all kinds of background research when we decided to tackle this problem and<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:17:50">0:17:50-0:18:03</a>:</strong>  accelerate the transition to Regen Ag.  We attended Groundswell here in the UK, which is this wonderful event.  I kind of liken it to the Glastonbury or for American listeners, Lollapalooza of Regen<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:03">0:18:03-0:18:17</a>:</strong>  Ag, just this massive festival, so feel good, wonderful community there.  And we talked to so many farmers and really started understanding the issues that they  faced, what drove them to transition to Regen, the impetus that they had and what that journey<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:25</a>:</strong>  was like for them.  And that really helped inform our thinking.  But something, you know, Kun, you were talking about how much we've evolved since you last<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:25">0:18:25-0:18:37</a>:</strong>  spoke to us in November.  When we first started working on this problem, we understood that there were two main barriers  that farmers faced to even thinking about becoming regenerative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:37">0:18:37-0:18:51</a>:</strong>  And one was an informational barrier challenge.  They didn't know what to do on their specific land and their fields because they might see  their neighbour doing something different, regenerative, but they would say, well, my<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:18:51">0:18:51-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  fields are different, my operation is different, my land is different.  Which is true because it's, as we know, extremely context specific.  Two hundred percent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:11</a>:</strong>  That's exactly it.  It's so context specific that you can't take a cookie cutter formula and just plunk it  down on another farm and expect it to work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:11">0:19:11-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  So that's very challenging right there.  It needs to be a very customised and adaptive approach as you go.  Regen is a journey, not a destination.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:30</a>:</strong>  And one of the things I love about it is they're always looking to improve.  I think Regen farmers are some of the best scientists on the planet.  The way they're always reacting to what happens and trying to find something new and better<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:30">0:19:30-0:19:43</a>:</strong>  that works.  So that is a challenge if you're used to doing things in a more cookie cutter conventional  way to all of a sudden have to completely adapt what you're doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:19:43">0:19:43-0:20:01</a>:</strong>  But the other thing was of course finance because as Joe Stanley says in his wonderful  book Farm to Fork, it's hard to be green when your finances are in the red.  And you and I just talked about how difficult these farmers are finding it, how the system<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:01">0:20:01-0:20:11</a>:</strong>  isn't working brilliantly.  In the UK because of Brexit the farmers here are losing the subsidies that they had been  receiving from the EU.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:11">0:20:11-0:20:22</a>:</strong>  And farming hasn't been just the most profitable thing in the world to begin with, with the  low food prices and how much the grocery stores are willing to pay for produce and things  like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:22">0:20:22-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  A lot of the farms here had been relying fairly heavily to even depending upon these subsidies,  just almost like insurance in case they had a bad year with the crop or things like that.  And so with that going away that makes it all the harder for them to think about doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  something new that might be risky.  There's a lot of tension or stress in the market now as the new system is coming into  place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:20:58</a>:</strong>  It's not very clear yet if I, I mean we can spend hours on this alone.  It's a very interesting opportunity.  I think everybody in this space globally is watching because it's the sort of forced reset<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:20:58">0:20:58-0:21:14</a>:</strong>  of a subsidy system and there at least is a lot of intention to move into more like  say outcome based schemes and not just very simply pay because you have land for whatever  reason whenever you took it, stole it, bought it, etc. or inherited it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:14">0:21:14-0:21:27</a>:</strong>  And so that it's a very interesting experiment.  But of course if you're right in it and you are dependent, like say most of your profit  comes from or your living income comes from subsidies that are disappearing almost overnight,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:27">0:21:27-0:21:35</a>:</strong>  it's very stressful.  And then you are adding the input crisis we have at the moment.  We're living in a time where input costs went through the roof and yet I can imagine<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:35">0:21:35-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  creates a lot of stress in not the right places.  That's exactly it.  You mentioned the environmental land management scheme ELMS and this is very, very true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  So an outcome based environmentally focused scheme to help replace this subsidy that to  be honest farmers kind of received just for the fact that they farmed land.  There is kind of no strings attached money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:12</a>:</strong>  For the most part it went to the bottom line which was very helpful for farmers and is  one of the reasons that a robust crop insurance system hasn't really developed here in the  UK.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:12">0:22:12-0:22:21</a>:</strong>  And so with the loss of that they're losing that buffer that what functioned as insurance  and the land management scheme that may be coming in that as you said is more outcomes  based.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:21">0:22:21-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  There's a few issues with it.  Nobody knows exactly how it's going to play out.  That's issue number one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  As an entrepreneur that's difficult to plan for if you're running your farm obviously  as a company.  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:46</a>:</strong>  I think that the National Farmers Union, the NFU here is having a conference next week  and one of their talks is like is uncertainty the new business norm or something like that.  So yes it's very hard to plan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:46">0:22:46-0:22:56</a>:</strong>  And I can tell you it is and it will be because nobody's going to be super happy with 100%  happy with all of these but it's coming like there's massive changes coming.  Oh, the one thing is certain is change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:22:56">0:22:56-0:23:04</a>:</strong>  Yeah, the one thing is certain is this.  So how does that you're saying we want to help create this offer and we want to help  farmers transition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:04">0:23:04-0:23:13</a>:</strong>  What's the entry point?  What's the least, I wouldn't say easiest because none of this is easy, but what's the first  step or the first entry point for a new company like agreed?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:13">0:23:13-0:23:20</a>:</strong>  It's not that you're you've been around for a long time.  You have a stable business somewhere else and you're going to do also some new things.  Now this is the main business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:20">0:23:20-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  What did you decide as the focal point?  Like is that the knife edge?  There are many other facets obviously, but the point of the knife to enter this and to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:36</a>:</strong>  meet the farmers where they are aware and then help them where they want to go.  Yeah, exactly.  Well, if you think like a farmer and you're losing this subsidy that was kind of your<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:36">0:23:36-0:23:51</a>:</strong>  insurance buffer and your input costs arising at the same time, it's basically a perfect  financial storm that farmers are facing here.  And we realized that nitrogen actually was the key to everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:23:51">0:23:51-0:24:05</a>:</strong>  It was the starting point of the journey because the price of nitrogen fertilizer last year  alone rose about 300% which is just huge.  Three and two zeros, listeners, three and two zeros, that's three times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:05">0:24:05-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  So imagine your main input costs, one of the main input costs overnight went 3x.  Okay, that's significant.  Exactly, 3x and that's the thing that kind of ensures you get that yield that you are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:34</a>:</strong>  incentivized to chase.  And so that was huge to say the least.  And we realized that nitrogen is the key because first of all, it is one of the biggest sources<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:34">0:24:34-0:24:48</a>:</strong>  of the carbon footprint of a farm.  I think a lot of people are focused on carbon and rightfully so, but in some ways this is  almost like an etymological problem because actually what we're focused on is greenhouse<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:24:48">0:24:48-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  gases and warming.  And if you think about that, nitrogen is one of the biggest causes of greenhouse gases  in farming because of the Haber-Bosch process that's used to produce it with methane which<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  consumes about 2% of the world's energy which is just mind-boggling when you think about  it.  And then you spend all that energy and fossil fuels to create this nitrogen fertilizer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:31</a>:</strong>  When you put it on the fields, you have the other 50% of the emissions which is actually  in the form of nitrous oxide which is a potent greenhouse gas, 300 times more potent than  CO2 that is released in the fields.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:31">0:25:31-0:25:43</a>:</strong>  Nitrous oxide is actually a component of smog as well so you've got an air pollution factor.  So it's just this huge carbon footprint all just to grow our food.  Carbon equivalent, that's I think the important part here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:43">0:25:43-0:25:55</a>:</strong>  So we just do some of this and then we get to the part that doesn't even get its effect  basically because most of it is wasted.  But just to understand this is a greenhouse gas that we say always carbon equivalent,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:25:55">0:25:55-0:26:04</a>:</strong>  we should always say carbon dioxide equivalent or greenhouse gases as there are many different  ones.  This is one that's 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide or CO2 and it's created with<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:04">0:26:04-0:26:16</a>:</strong>  a lot of energy which I know people are working on.  But let's say the fertilizer issue on just the production side and then you write it  on your land or you spread it and most of it doesn't end up on a plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:16">0:26:16-0:26:32</a>:</strong>  Most of it is being like the oxide comes off which creates huge amounts of smoke.  And so it's a massively wasteful stuff which by any means has created a lot of benefits  as well, a lot of cheap calories we've been producing over the last more or less a century,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:32">0:26:32-0:26:42</a>:</strong>  probably a bit more.  But it's creating an enormous wasteful process that has to change.  Like if we like either if you're concerned by energy use, this has to change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:42">0:26:42-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  If you're concerned about smoke and does long health and I mean we've just been in two years  of mayhem because of a lot of issues let's say around breathing and issues of smoke.  It's definitely a thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:27:01</a>:</strong>  I mean many people die of smoke every year.  Or if you're worried about farmers' financial health because this is a massive cost that  went up 300%.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:01">0:27:01-0:27:11</a>:</strong>  This is something we don't talk about enough, nitrogen, nitrogen, nitrogen.  And it's an essential thing for plants to grow.  The issue is when you put chemical night, cut more fertilizer, most of it doesn't end<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:11">0:27:11-0:27:14</a>:</strong>  up in plants, right?  What's the percentage?  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:14">0:27:14-0:27:26</a>:</strong>  Oh goodness.  I mean there's so much variation in that but what I can say is that vast majority about  let's say the first 50 to 60% of the nitrogen that you put on the ground is probably going<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:26">0:27:26-0:27:38</a>:</strong>  to be going into the plant and producing that yield and the rest that they put is just chasing  incremental yield because it's not bioavailable to the plant.  And that leads to the other problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:38">0:27:38-0:27:47</a>:</strong>  There's so many but the big problem of runoff.  What is runoff?  It sounds weird but what just for anybody doesn't live next to a farm on a rainy day,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:47">0:27:47-0:27:55</a>:</strong>  what is runoff?  Yeah.  So the nitrogen that can't be absorbed by the plant then is washed off the field by<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:27:55">0:27:55-0:28:13</a>:</strong>  rain and will enter the watershed, enter the water system.  Just last month, it was announced that 100% of the rivers in the UK are polluted.  Now of course, that is not only nitrogen fertilizer or nitrate but that is a big component of<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:13">0:28:13-0:28:24</a>:</strong>  it for sure and it causes algal blooms and eutrophication in the waterways.  It's just so bad.  It's a massive issue.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:24">0:28:24-0:28:35</a>:</strong>  It's a massive issue.  There are ways and we can talk about that for a long time but let's say with regenerative  applying practices with the goal of regenerating soil etc. will dramatically reduce depending<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:35">0:28:35-0:28:48</a>:</strong>  how you apply them, how you mix them with the cover crops, keeping the soil covered,  reduces runoff, making a lot more of the nitrogen that is already in the soil bioavailable,  getting the microbial life back into action, biodiversity etc. etc.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:28:48">0:28:48-0:29:05</a>:</strong>  All of those things we know they can dramatically reduce or completely reduce the need for chemical  fertilizer but as we know that and we've seen examples that Kate Brown and many others that  have shown that, the question is how do you make sure that a good chunk and as many as<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:05">0:29:05-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  possible of the farmers in the UK start with them and what's the best start, best point  and how do we incentivize them because of course we cannot ask them as they are deeply  in red to also start paying for new machinery or paying for crop cover crop mixes and because<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  this transition costs money or at least you have yield drops etc. to take care of it the  first year.  So as we know that we know it's an issue and now how do we attack that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:33">0:29:33-0:29:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah exactly.  We have to meet the farmers where they are and understand things from their vantage point.  They are financially squeezed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:40">0:29:40-0:29:53</a>:</strong>  So even if they had the information and totally understood how exactly to do it on their land,  you know again they are financially probably unable to take on that risk without this buffer  there anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:53">0:29:53-0:29:59</a>:</strong>  Nobody would.  Let's just be clear nobody would take on that risk.  If you would be the company owner you wouldn't take on that risk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:29:59">0:29:59-0:30:09</a>:</strong>  Farms are businesses.  Farms are businesses and we have to speak their language which is finance and so that's  where we realized that there was a real opportunity here actually as they're losing the subsidies<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:09">0:30:09-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  and as prices are high and you know likely to stay high for quite a while it's an opportunity  to help them switch on to regenerative practices which reduce their reliance on chemical nitrogen  fertilizer through very simple gateway practices like using cover crops that help fix nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:35</a>:</strong>  naturally from the air.  So that's where we started.  But again if they start on this journey they're going to need to figure out how it works best<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:35">0:30:35-0:30:47</a>:</strong>  for their land, their practice.  That's that context again.  And so what we realized the opportunity was was to help them access finance that would<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:47">0:30:47-0:30:57</a>:</strong>  de-risk that transition for them because as they figure things out they may have a drop  in yield.  They're going to have to try things, experiment a little bit, figure out what works on their<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:30:57">0:30:57-0:31:15</a>:</strong>  land and honestly rehabilitate their soil and build back up that natural fertility because  the one thing about nitrogen fertilizer you and I didn't cover yet is the fact that  it actually kind of kills the soil microbial life that provides that natural fertility.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:15">0:31:15-0:31:26</a>:</strong>  It disrupts the natural market that exists between a plant and the soil microbes where  the plant is exuding carbon to feed the soil microbes and they then release minerals and  nutrients back to the plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:26">0:31:26-0:31:37</a>:</strong>  It's a virtuous cycle.  It's like a market, underground market that you didn't know was happening all the time.  And so if the plant is getting a lot of this nutrient from above in a chemical form it<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:37">0:31:37-0:31:50</a>:</strong>  kind of doesn't need to work as hard to feed the microbes and they don't get as  much carbon and then they don't exude as much nutrients as well.  So yeah, it's disrupting that and the farmers aren't building their soil organic matter<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:31:50">0:31:50-0:32:03</a>:</strong>  as much as they could be by relying on nitrogen and that keeps the farmer on this input financial  treadmill where they're reliant upon it to chase that yield.  And so how do we get them off the treadmill?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:03">0:32:03-0:32:13</a>:</strong>  What's the angle?  I mean you can of course go out and we've had them on the podcast, Perennial Fund and  Replant Capital to a certain extent and some others that are trying to build transition<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:13">0:32:13-0:32:24</a>:</strong>  finance too and are building transition finance funds which we've seen is a lot of work  of course but also to raise money for this is not easy at all.  You decided to take another route.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:24">0:32:24-0:32:35</a>:</strong>  You decided to see where the money already is or where the risk already is which is a  very interesting one.  So where did you say, okay, let's get transition finance but let's not set up a massive fund<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:35">0:32:35-0:32:46</a>:</strong>  or crowdfunding platform or lending platform on our own?  Yeah and first of all, a shout out to you and your podcast because that really helped  inform our understanding of the issue with the Mad Agriculture Perennial Fund interviews<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:32:46">0:32:46-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  and the one with or the many I should say with New Foundation Farms and really understanding  that there are people creating funds and trying to purchase land to then switch it over and  we're actually working with one of those funds which I can mention later.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:16</a>:</strong>  But we realized, again going back to the mission since we're mission driven and the mission  is to help farmers transition, we realized that in order to move the needle at scale  we needed to work with people who had those relationships with farmers already rather<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:16">0:33:16-0:33:20</a>:</strong>  than trying to go farm to farm.  Knocking on the door.  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:20">0:33:20-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  Knocking on the door, exactly.  We also as part of our mission just to make things more challenging for ourselves because  trying to save the planet and entrepreneurship in agriculture weren't challenging enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:33:45</a>:</strong>  We have a mission where we do not want to charge farmers.  We want to help farmers and put money back into their pockets.  And so we needed a way to do this at scale with people who have relationships with farmers<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:45">0:33:45-0:33:56</a>:</strong>  but in a way that could get finance to them where they're not paying themselves for this  transition.  And so we realized that there was an opportunity with banks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:33:56">0:33:56-0:34:17</a>:</strong>  Banks have relationships with the vast majority of farmers in the country and also thanks  to some recent developments, banks now have a statutory obligation to report on the carbon  footprint and exposure of their book of debt and to also be moving that book of debt towards<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:17">0:34:17-0:34:25</a>:</strong>  net zero by 2040, which is wonderful.  But nobody knows how to do that.  Well, it's also a problem for the banks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:25">0:34:25-0:34:37</a>:</strong>  If you're an agriculture bank, yeah, your emissions are going to come from practices,  they're going to come by your clients, your farmers.  And so you're going to need to work with them to help them implement different ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:37">0:34:37-0:34:48</a>:</strong>  Just like you have to work with your real estate portfolio if you happen to be large  on that, you start changing the light bulbs, it's letting, I mean, depending on what's  the state of the real estate, but there are a lot of things you can do to bring it when<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:48">0:34:48-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  say to net zero immediately, but actually energy positive if you wanted to, but very  close.  I mean, there are a lot of low hanging fruit there, which is interesting for a bank as<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:35:07</a>:</strong>  well because most of these are financial finance questions like yield drop in three years,  but then interesting returns after that's a financial question.  If you want to go to organic, there are premiums.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:07">0:35:07-0:35:13</a>:</strong>  We can model it out.  We can, we can figure it out if you want to go.  I mean, I know there even, I heard yesterday some interesting premiums for a region organic<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:13">0:35:13-0:35:25</a>:</strong>  in the US if you're certified, like there are brands now like there, this is a finance  question at the time with finance, you can sort of travel, you can bridge the three years  to five years, whatever your field needs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:25">0:35:25-0:35:38</a>:</strong>  If they're obviously interesting financial incentives after, which could be great contracts,  off take agreements, which could be albums that finally wakes up at that time or other  things, but this should get bankers very excited because this is a financial, we need financial<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:38">0:35:38-0:35:46</a>:</strong>  products to bridge that, but then we need intermediaries or at least people to connect  with the farmers to do that.  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:46">0:35:46-0:35:53</a>:</strong>  We need to help these farmers.  Do they get excited about it or just they get scared?  Like the banks, the conversations because you have had money with the banks recently,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:35:53">0:35:53-0:36:06</a>:</strong>  are they interested in seeing this as an opportunity or are they being like, oh, we need to, oh  God, we need to, we need to move now because this thing is coming and we're going to report  and we have to, there's a lot of extra reporting we need to do because as banks we already<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:06">0:36:06-0:36:12</a>:</strong>  need to do so much.  What have you seen or do some of them see it as an opportunity now?  Oh, definitely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:12">0:36:12-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  I think the reaction that we've gotten with the many conversations we've had while mixed,  everybody has been interested and supportive.  In fact, we actually have three letters of interest from three banks about this particular<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:39</a>:</strong>  solution that we're working on, which is really wonderful.  One of the things to mention, you don't need to be an ag-only bank for this to be a real  issue because many banks lend in many different areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:39">0:36:39-0:36:51</a>:</strong>  Ag might even be a small portion of their lending, but the fact is that because agriculture  has such an outsized footprint of carbon, it's actually an outsized area of exposure  and risk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:36:51">0:36:51-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  Reporting, yeah.  And risk is interesting here because if these farmers keep going bankrupt because we push  them there, the bank at the end is on the hook for, because they have a lot of money<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:09</a>:</strong>  outstanding there, especially in bad seasons.  So there's a huge risk component, not just the reporting, there's a risk component here  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:09">0:37:09-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  And the better financial health your farmers are, your tenants, if you have a real estate  building, the easier your job is as a banker.  So how do you work with banks?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  How do you, or are you going to work with, because you have letters of interest, what's  the idea?  I mean, this can change if you reach out to Kelly in a month or so, maybe exact details<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:26">0:37:26-0:37:39</a>:</strong>  of this might be slightly different, but at the moment, how do you envision that?  Yeah, well, just taking a step back a little bit about the opportunity for banks here that  we realized, and this is what really aligns those incentives along the lines of what you<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:39">0:37:39-0:37:48</a>:</strong>  were talking about with the tram lines, right?  It's aligning interests and incentives.  The banks, of course, have this reporting obligation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:48">0:37:48-0:37:58</a>:</strong>  One of the problems they face is just such a massive thing to quantify, just trying to  quantify it.  I talked to one ESG manager in a bank and she was saying, well, we're taking averages<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:37:58">0:37:58-0:38:10</a>:</strong>  of averages to figure out how much carbon is sequestered in a hedgerow.  I was like, yeah, well, how long is a piece of string?  I mean, that's just such an impossible question to answer and an impossible or useless method<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:10">0:38:10-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  to arrive at the answer.  So the point is that they're scrambling trying to fill in these numbers, and we realized  that nitrogen actually is a wonderful component area to focus on because as we talked about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:35</a>:</strong>  it's such a part of the problem, but it's also incredibly easy to quantify.  Farmers know exactly how much nitrogen they are putting to the kilogram, most likely,  on their fields.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:35">0:38:35-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  And there are many ways of tracking that and looking at it over time.  And so we realized that we have an opportunity through our data to help banks not only quantify  their exposure on this one key metric, but also benchmark them against region farmers<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:39:04</a>:</strong>  who have reduced using region practices so that we could say, hey, bank, your farmers  are way up here.  And let's say five years' time, based on our data, we could see that they could reasonably<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:04">0:39:04-0:39:22</a>:</strong>  reduce 10 to 15% of that, which is a huge chunk of carbon CO2e equivalent.  And at the end of that period, they would be more financially resilient because they  would be less reliant on this expensive and fluctuating input.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:22">0:39:22-0:39:36</a>:</strong>  So most likely, data says that region farms are at least, if not more profitable once  they've reduced those inputs.  And in addition, they're going to be more resilient ecologically because region practices,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:36">0:39:36-0:39:50</a>:</strong>  for example, using cover crops, keeping the ground covered throughout the year, and having  living roots, and relying more on natural fertility means that those farmers can weather  weather events better like floods and droughts, which we know are increasing with climate<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:39:55</a>:</strong>  change.  So here you go, bank.  Your farmer is hurting right now, your customer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:39:55">0:39:55-0:40:08</a>:</strong>  You have a means that can help them through this difficult time as input costs are high  and as they lose these subsidies, that at the end of it will mean that your customer  is better off and you have a lower risk customer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:08">0:40:08-0:40:16</a>:</strong>  So you save them from going out of business and you help them future-proof their business  for going forward.  So that's a real win-win.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:16">0:40:16-0:40:27</a>:</strong>  And so how will they be financing it?  Is it lowering the, maybe it's about lowering the interest rate if a farmer, let's say,  starts with the program, there's no the program, but with the practices and starts learning<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:27">0:40:27-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  from nearby region farmers, starts learning, et cetera.  Or is it actually let's finance your machinery and let's finance the cover crop mix or let's  increase the depth, which is a risk to do that transition?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:47</a>:</strong>  Where do you see that?  Like that's, let's pile on more depth on farmers, which some people will cringe now when I say  it, or let's lower the interest rate, which I know some people are working on, like replant<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:47">0:40:47-0:40:55</a>:</strong>  capital.  Like if you're doing certain things connected to soil health, we can lower the interest  rate you're paying, which what the Trilos bank is doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:40:55">0:40:55-0:41:03</a>:</strong>  If you have a house that is on a lower level of energy use, you can actually, you actually  pay less in mortgage because the risk is lower.  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:03">0:41:03-0:41:18</a>:</strong>  Well, the answer is I see it as all of the above.  I see this as a real opportunity for innovation and region finance, regenerative finance,  because you know, of course it could be a lower interest loan and I think it should<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:18">0:41:18-0:41:25</a>:</strong>  be, to be honest with you.  One of our missions is to shift the needle on risk.  For the bank or the farmer or both?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:25">0:41:25-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  For both, for both, because both banks and farmers now see conventional farming as normal  and region as risky.  And the truth couldn't be any further from that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:48</a>:</strong>  It's actually region, which in the long run is going to be much less risky, much more  resilient, and conventional, which is driving farmers into the ground and you know, driving  the climate into crisis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:48">0:41:48-0:41:59</a>:</strong>  And so we want to make the case for region being lower risk and therefore it should be  rewarded as such through lower rates, just like you were talking about with the Triodos  Bank and mortgages and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:41:59">0:41:59-0:42:08</a>:</strong>  So we want to make that case and we want to take it straight to the banks who can then  take it straight to their customers and offer creative finance.  It could be lower interest loans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:08">0:42:08-0:42:21</a>:</strong>  It could be other things like grants up front simply because it reduces that bank's risk.  You know, there's all kinds of ways that they can do it.  And I think that comes back to one of our other ethos, which is optionality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:21">0:42:21-0:42:38</a>:</strong>  We don't believe in telling farmers, you have to do this.  What we think is the better way to go is to help them see a goal that would be beneficial  to them, like lowering their reliance on nitrogen, and then putting options in front of them<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:38">0:42:38-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  ways they could achieve that goal and letting them choose the one that's right for them.  So that's why we've built our platform to help connect farmers to other farmers who  are doing region practices so that they can... that don't necessarily have to be a customer<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:51">0:42:51-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  of the same bank.  I mean, this could be any farmer nearby that is in a similar position, in a similar context,  but farming very differently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:05</a>:</strong>  So you can see, feel, touch, smell, etc.  How a transition like that could work.  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:05">0:43:05-0:43:14</a>:</strong>  Seeing is believing.  We know that getting farmers to visit each other and having those farm walks, that's  very, very helpful in bringing these practices to life for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:14">0:43:14-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  Farmers learn best from other farmers, and that's how this is really going to spread.  If this were just a data issue, it might be solved by now because there is a lot of data,  there's a lot of decision support tools out there and more power to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:41</a>:</strong>  But to get that mental shift and the confidence for that farmer to begin on that journey,  they're going to need the financial security that even if they do have a drop in yield,  they're not literally betting and losing the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:41">0:43:41-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  And they also need that psychological security of knowing that there are other people who've  been there before, who've done this, and give them some advice.  If X happens, that farmer knows what it's like and has some thoughts on what to do in<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:07</a>:</strong>  that context.  So I think you cannot eliminate the human element of this.  Farming is a competitive sport, but it's also very collaborative at the same time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:07">0:44:07-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  It's one of those central paradoxes of it that I love.  And so we want to facilitate that.  So we've built this platform to connect farmers to each other and help visualize what region<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  looks like.  So a farmer arrives, let's say a farmer arrives now, registers him or herself on the platform  and then you suggest like, look, actually not so far away from you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:38</a>:</strong>  There are people doing very interesting things.  You might've heard about them, et cetera, but it's actually, and those farmers that  like these, let's say the region farmers that are a few years ahead, are they open to getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:38">0:44:38-0:44:45</a>:</strong>  because they might get a lot of these requests now from them.  I would love to have a farm work.  I would love to see like, how do you manage that process of, because seeing is believing,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:45">0:44:45-0:44:52</a>:</strong>  but these farmers also have to farm.  It's not that they can do farm tours all day, every day, the whole month.  I mean, then nothing gets done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:44:52">0:44:52-0:45:02</a>:</strong>  So how do you manage that process without overwhelming the, let's say the mentors?  Yeah, well, that's a really great point.  So I think that connecting with other farmers is important, but also connecting with agronomy<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:02">0:45:02-0:45:15</a>:</strong>  advisors who specialize in region is important.  And these farmers exist and we are aggregating them on our platform.  So you can kind of have one-stop shopping, find somebody near you, fits your philosophy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:15">0:45:15-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  But region advisors right now, most of them, and I was talking to some at the recent base  conference here in the UK of region farmers, they do region advising, but it's not their  entire book of business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:36</a>:</strong>  They couldn't probably support themselves right now only on region.  And so we'd love to change that.  We'd love to funnel new farmers getting on this journey to them so that they can only<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:36">0:45:36-0:45:47</a>:</strong>  focus on region, which is their passion.  And again, in this case, the farmer wouldn't pay, but the advisor would pay you or even  not like what the terms of business for agreed, the farmer doesn't pay, which means that it<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:45:47">0:45:47-0:46:00</a>:</strong>  has to come from the agronomist advisor.  So what we are doing is building this platform free for farmers.  And we're not as currently stands charging anybody to be on the platform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:00">0:46:00-0:46:16</a>:</strong>  We want this to be a freely available resource for the agronomy advisors, for the farmers,  for brands like you talked about, you know, there's friends like root zero potatoes, which  are growing carbon neutral potatoes and a wild farmed wheat, which you may know of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:16">0:46:16-0:46:25</a>:</strong>  I'm smiling because they should come on, but it might take a few more months.  But yeah, we're in touch with Wild Farm.  I'll put a link below if you want to know more about green and very innovative ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:25">0:46:25-0:46:30</a>:</strong>  of farming that.  Definitely check out the website of Wild Farm.  Oh my goodness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:30">0:46:30-0:46:41</a>:</strong>  We could do an entire podcast session on just on wheat and nitrogen.  I think that's a whole other topic.  But at any rate, we're putting these resources for farmers to plug into even the carbon markets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:41">0:46:41-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  You know, a lot of times we've gotten question, well, there's so much happening in the carbon  market space.  How are you going to be different?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:47:01</a>:</strong>  And we don't see ourselves as in competition at all with the carbon markets.  We see ourselves as the beginning of that journey by getting off of nitrogen reliance.  The farmers can then really begin sequestering that carbon in their soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:01">0:47:01-0:47:12</a>:</strong>  So if they want to go ahead and sell those credits later, they can.  And we have put a different markets on our platform for them to potentially plug into,  you know, markets like Agrena.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:12">0:47:12-0:47:21</a>:</strong>  So we support that, but it's up to the farmer.  All we want to do is help them reduce their reliance on nitrogen.  And we are working with the banks to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:29</a>:</strong>  And so that's where our funding, our financial model comes from is working with the banks.  Business model comes from.  Yes, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:29">0:47:29-0:47:37</a>:</strong>  So we want to be free to farmers.  I mean, in terms of finding a business model, go where the money is to a certain extent.  Banks are known for having money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:37">0:47:37-0:47:50</a>:</strong>  They are known for managing large amounts and having small margins, but they are still  managing to be remarkably profitable over the last years.  And yeah, it's, that's definitely an interesting choice and not trying to take a spread on<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:47:50">0:47:50-0:48:04</a>:</strong>  the carbon side of things or it's where a lot of noise is happening, a lot of focus.  But what's very interesting, I think of this conversation is that the actual, that the  big elephant in the room is nitrogen and nitrogen oxide, which is very potent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:04">0:48:04-0:48:14</a>:</strong>  Let's not underestimate that.  And it's very visible literally because of smoke and very visible literally because of  runoff and probably let's say that the rest of the general world, as we're going into<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:14">0:48:14-0:48:23</a>:</strong>  the carbon hype, we'll start paying attention to, hopefully paying attention to nitrogen  because it's much more eminent also on the balance sheet of a farmer and the balance  sheet of a bank apparently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:23">0:48:23-0:48:31</a>:</strong>  And the balance sheet of a bank.  That's exactly it.  So, you know, shout out to Mark Carney for really bringing the financial system into<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:31">0:48:31-0:48:47</a>:</strong>  the climate crisis solution and driving this change.  And, you know, I think he's been a big part of this focus on getting banks to report on  this and also shift their financing away from the source of the problem or trying to reduce<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:47">0:48:47-0:48:52</a>:</strong>  it.  And, you know, banks have placed an outsized role in funding the sources of the climate  crisis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:48:52">0:48:52-0:49:03</a>:</strong>  And I think that they are really starting to step up and recognize that and then try  to instead fund the solution.  And my goodness, this is a big part of that solution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:03">0:49:03-0:49:14</a>:</strong>  And to end with a few final questions, as we can talk about nitrogen and all of that  for hours, but I want to keep that for another interview.  If you would be in that investor chair, like let's say you had a billion pound sterling<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:14">0:49:14-0:49:24</a>:</strong>  to invest or 10 billion, like a large amount, what would you focus on?  What would be your priorities to get funded or to invest in because this is an investment  fund?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:24">0:49:24-0:49:27</a>:</strong>  It can be very long, long term.  I don't care.  But what would you focus on?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:27">0:49:27-0:49:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  Well, I, you know, again, kind of would want to focus on solutions to the problem, things  that are helping draw down carbon as opposed to just being less bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:37">0:49:37-0:49:49</a>:</strong>  But I think the other thing is there are always start with the problem in entrepreneurship.  You know, value is created when you solve a problem for somebody.  And so look at what the problems are in the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:49:49">0:49:49-0:50:05</a>:</strong>  And some of these problems may not be considered as sexy, but they're real burning hair.  For example, I can think of, you know, more sustainable farmers, region farmers wanting  to sell more directly to customers because right now it's very difficult for them to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:05">0:50:05-0:50:16</a>:</strong>  get any kind of premium on their produce.  There's not a region certification like there is for organic.  There's not a known crafted market for those products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:16">0:50:16-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  Consumer awareness of what region even is right now is still quite low.  So that would be a real problem area that the farmers themselves are facing.  And you know, we've talked about the challenges with the transition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:33</a>:</strong>  Well, once you have transitioned, how do you get rewarded for having done that transition?  You need markets.  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:33">0:50:33-0:50:44</a>:</strong>  You need markets.  Another thing would be, you know, you could sell direct consumers, but combinable crops,  they have a real challenge because their produce just gets lumped in with unsustainable high<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:44">0:50:44-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  input produce and sold at the same low price.  So somebody who can help solve that problem, that would be huge.  And you'd probably be able to further incentivize a bigger shift these massive crops away from<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:51:03</a>:</strong>  high inputs if they knew that they could get rewarded for it on the other end.  Yeah.  The more we talk about it, actually, it should be live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:03">0:51:03-0:51:09</a>:</strong>  No, maybe.  No, it will be live today actually.  Paul Lightfoot, in the interview, I was messing up the production schedule.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:09">0:51:09-0:51:21</a>:</strong>  Lightfoot, Paul Lightfoot, I'll put it in the chat as well, or in the description below,  runs a newsletter, is investor himself, and we interviewed him on carbon negative foods  or negative foods as he called it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:21">0:51:21-0:51:32</a>:</strong>  So that's the biggest lever for him, at least.  We had a very interesting discussion on creating these markets consumers wanted.  Carbon labeling is coming and now it's up to us to create the brands that pay the farmer<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:32">0:51:32-0:51:40</a>:</strong>  and the farmers, but also make sure we tell and explain and share that story of soil and  the complexity.  But there's some very interesting things happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:40">0:51:40-0:51:51</a>:</strong>  I mean, you mentioned Wildfarmed, but there are luckily others that are moving that needle  because we need much better brands.  We need much better produce products, process things, because not everything can be sold<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:51:51">0:51:51-0:52:02</a>:</strong>  fresh grain as a great example to get it in our house or get it in our shopping carts  or to get it in our home, which is a, yeah, probably you can put a billion dollars to  work there or a billion pounds if you wanted to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:02">0:52:02-0:52:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.  So if those brands pop up or crop up, I should say, then we can put them on our platform  because at the end of the day, we're an ecosystem player and we want to support all the players<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:12">0:52:12-0:52:23</a>:</strong>  who are doing good in this space.  So yeah, we are going through banks to reach their customers to help get them financing  for this transition to de-risk it for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:23">0:52:23-0:52:31</a>:</strong>  And that's how we see ourselves as moving the needle.  And final question, if you had a magic wand, what would you change in this space?  In any space?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:31">0:52:31-0:52:43</a>:</strong>  It could be literally global consciousness if you wanted to, or better taste, which probably  what I would say, but at what, in terms of flavor and in terms of clothes or decoration  or anything, I'm literally only talking about food, but what would you change if you had<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:43">0:52:43-0:52:54</a>:</strong>  the magic power to change one thing only?  Oh my God, so many things, but the one thing I would change is externalities.  Right now the polluter doesn't pay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:52:54">0:52:54-0:53:11</a>:</strong>  And right now the farmer is being vilified as the polluter, even though the entire system  incentivizes the farmer to farm this way right now.  And so if we simply costed in the environmental cost of this nitrogen, the chemical inputs,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:11">0:53:11-0:53:23</a>:</strong>  then it would not be remotely economical to farm this way.  It's already kind of becoming that way because the cost of nitrogen is predicated on the  cost of natural gas and energy, which as we all know, especially here in Europe, has risen<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:23">0:53:23-0:53:33</a>:</strong>  a lot recently.  So I would cost that in and that would drive system change.  But I also understand that that's very politically unpopular and would lead to all kinds of other<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:33">0:53:33-0:53:48</a>:</strong>  problems like much higher food costs, which could hurt a lot of people too.  So I don't want to pretend that it is a simple solution, but I think that those externalities  are a huge driver of the problem that we've found ourselves in, this massive rut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:48">0:53:48-0:53:54</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.  The true cost of the food we pay, I think they did the study, the Rockefellers paid  for the study in the US.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:53:54">0:53:54-0:54:07</a>:</strong>  I think it's 3x what we pay in the US yearly for food and the true cost in terms of health  and environmental and social, what they could calculate.  So imagine it's still a lot higher is about 3x.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:07">0:54:07-0:54:17</a>:</strong>  That's saying we should charge that now and everything should be 3x because of course  that would lead to huge disruption, but we need to figure out an off-ramp of that as  well because we're paying it anyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:17">0:54:17-0:54:28</a>:</strong>  It's not that it is coming, the bill is coming and we're already paying for the dirty rivers,  we're paying for a lot of this indirectly and directly on the health side of things.  So it's definitely coming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:28">0:54:28-0:54:35</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.  And farmers right now, it's not the most profitable model even right now without it being priced  in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:35">0:54:35-0:54:50</a>:</strong>  And in the UK, a lot of other places, but definitely the UK, our cost of food here is  actually quite low compared to how it used to be like right post-war and everything.  And even then we have people in food poverty and the use of food banks has grown exponentially<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:50">0:54:50-0:54:57</a>:</strong>  just in the past decade.  So Houston, we have a problem and we really need a lot of creative minds to work towards  solving it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:54:57">0:54:57-0:55:05</a>:</strong>  And I hope that maybe your podcast can really inspire a lot more to get working on this.  Let's hope so.  We need more people in this space building things, that's for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:05">0:55:05-0:55:20</a>:</strong>  I want to thank you so much Kelly for your time in this wild journey that you're on and  looking forward to follow it to check in over time and to see how we can get some of those  big banks to start changing, working with their customers, actually working with instead<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:20">0:55:20-0:55:25</a>:</strong>  of...  Working with their customers.  And being part of the solution just as we want farming to be part of the solution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:55:25">0:55:25-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  Exactly.  Well, thank you so much, Koon.  I really appreciate it.<br />

Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:22">0:56:22-0:56:34</a>:</strong>  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.  Why are we doing this course after a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of  audio asking the question how to put money to work in regenerating soils and I've been<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:34">0:56:34-0:56:44</a>:</strong>  following the space since 2011 and recording these podcasts since 2016 we thought it was  time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:44">0:56:44-0:56:54</a>:</strong>  How have we built our decision making framework, what to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  What is happening in the space?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:54">0:56:54-0:56:58</a>:</strong>  What should you read?  What should you listen?  What should you watch?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:56:58">0:56:58-0:57:11</a>:</strong>  How to approach this space for whom is this course?

People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:23">0:57:23-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital banks, insurance companies,  et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:38</a>:</strong>  Is this course free?  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:38">0:57:38-0:57:48</a>:</strong>  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.

<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:48">0:57:48-0:57:57</a>:</strong>  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:57:57">0:57:57-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:21</a>:</strong>  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:21">0:58:21-0:58:32</a>:</strong>  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:32">0:58:32-0:58:39</a>:</strong>  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:39">0:58:39-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/kelly-price#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:59:02</a>:</strong>  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking, click on  the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.  </p>
