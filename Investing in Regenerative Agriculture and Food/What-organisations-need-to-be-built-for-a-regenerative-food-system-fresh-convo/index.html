<p><strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:13</a>:</strong>  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:13">0:00:13-0:00:24</a>:</strong>  Welcome to a very special episode where we hosted a conversation together with the team  of Fresh Ventures.  A conversation where we dig deeper into what ventures need to be built, what ventures are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:24">0:00:24-0:00:36</a>:</strong>  we missing in the space of regenerative food and agriculture.  We're going to do this more regularly, so enjoy.  Welcome everyone to the first Fresh Convo, Fresh Conversations that we're hosting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:36">0:00:36-0:00:45</a>:</strong>  A little bit of background.  My name is Bart van der Zonde.  I'm one of the co-founders of the Fresh Venture Studio, the organization that set this up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:00:45">0:00:45-0:01:00</a>:</strong>  We are a startup studio on a mission to regenerative and circular food system.  We intend to build multiple new steward owned organizations to help the transition, accelerate  the transition to a regenerative food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:00">0:01:00-0:01:15</a>:</strong>  In that context, we are continuously looking and getting into conversations on what are  the actual problems or where are the opportunities that would require more attention from entrepreneurial  teams and talent to work on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:15">0:01:15-0:01:33</a>:</strong>  What would really help the ecosystem forward in bringing about this more regenerative food  system.  Koen van Zijer, one of the co-hosts today is someone we talk a lot with on this subject.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:33">0:01:33-0:01:43</a>:</strong>  We really like his podcast as well for those who don't know it, Investing in Regenerative  Agriculture podcast.  Really a lot of great conversations on this subject.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:01:43">0:01:43-0:02:00</a>:</strong>  We decided to start hosting open conversations about specifically what are potential opportunities  that would need more entrepreneurial energy.  I would say what are problems that are still very hard to solve that could really deserve<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:00">0:02:00-0:02:09</a>:</strong>  some additional attention from maybe a different type of people that are working on it right  now.  That is the central question today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:09">0:02:09-0:02:22</a>:</strong>  For the technical part, I would like to invite you all very much to contribute.  There is no set program for this conversation.  Please share your thoughts as well, your questions, things you want to bring into this group of<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:22">0:02:22-0:02:32</a>:</strong>  people.  I think it's an interesting group.  If you want to say something, I would like to ask you to make it a little bit civilized<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:32">0:02:32-0:02:46</a>:</strong>  to add a comment in the chat.  Then we'll make sure that people get or raise your hand like Koen van Zijer.  We'll make sure that we sort of pass on the talking stick, I would say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:46">0:02:46-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  Before I move into this, I have one short poll that I would like to do.  This is to get a little bit of an idea of the people who are in this space right now  and also that you have an idea of what kind of people are here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:09</a>:</strong>  It's always a little bit difficult if you're digitally connected and not physically.  Paul is going to start a poll.  If you can answer it, two questions and then we have a little bit of an idea of who we<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:09">0:03:09-0:03:37</a>:</strong>  all are.  It should be quite easy.  We'll share the results in a little bit so you can see what the rest is doing as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:37">0:03:37-0:03:46</a>:</strong>  85% voted.  All right.  Everyone voted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:03:46">0:03:46-0:04:01</a>:</strong>  Paul, if you can share the results.  The biggest part of this group is an entrepreneur themselves, investors and knowledge workers  come in second.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  Also quite a quarter of the group is intending to start a new business, probably a reason  to find answers to the question, all right, where to start, where can I make the most  impact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:12">0:04:12-0:04:20</a>:</strong>  All right.  Thank you, Paul.  My co-host of the day is Koen van Zeyer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:20">0:04:20-0:04:33</a>:</strong>  As I said, Koen, you have been doing over 120 interviews.  I think you said over five or six years you've been in the game quite long and you've talked  to a lot of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:33">0:04:33-0:04:47</a>:</strong>  I wanted to actually start with you in raising this question on what do you think and what  would you say after these 120 interviews are the biggest problems but also opportunities  for venture building?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:04:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah, sure.  Thank you so much, first of all, for organizing this.  It's always nice to show up somewhere and not having to do all the background and all<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:04:54">0:04:54-0:05:03</a>:</strong>  the organization.  And I'm very happy, obviously, that Fresh got started after many, many discussions with  people back in the day and over the last years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  I think I've done a number of shout outs in the podcast that we need more venture builders  while you were building your venture builders.  So I'm very happy that it's public now and ventures are being built.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:24</a>:</strong>  So for me, I mean, for anybody that doesn't know, the journey we've been on is I think  we started interviewing now about four and a half years ago.  It feels a lot more or maybe five.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:24">0:05:24-0:05:30</a>:</strong>  I have to check.  But it was very sporadic at the beginning.  We just interviewed a few friends, interviewed a few people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:30">0:05:30-0:05:39</a>:</strong>  Honestly, for me to hang out with people virtually that were building or are building interesting  things in the region for the next phase, because I didn't know what I wanted to build myself.  I'm not the farmer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:39">0:05:39-0:05:48</a>:</strong>  I don't have the huge urge to start a farm, nor honestly, the investor, because I don't  have the wealth.  So I really wondered, what can I do in this space?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:48">0:05:48-0:05:58</a>:</strong>  And I thought the best way is probably to hang out with people that are building things.  And to do that, I had to interview them.  And of course, I had also to publish them, but it was not even part of the game.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:05:58">0:05:58-0:06:08</a>:</strong>  So we did that for a number of years, and since the last two or three years, we really  brought some more structure to the table.  And now we're releasing an episode a week, and we're doing a number of series, and it<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:08">0:06:08-0:06:21</a>:</strong>  really became a small media company.  In terms of lessons learned, I think the first one is really the attention for soil.  Of course, my bubble has grown, but really exploded over the last years, which is amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:21">0:06:21-0:06:34</a>:</strong>  We need way more attention for the way we treat land, oceans, and basically our planet,  need way more attention for the opportunities.  And what we've seen, we sort of identified four themes, I think a year and a half or<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:34">0:06:34-0:06:47</a>:</strong>  two years ago now, which are still very current, that we see huge challenges, also huge opportunities,  not necessarily the easiest places to build things, but definitely in our mind, huge opportunities  over the next decade or so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:47">0:06:47-0:06:58</a>:</strong>  These are long term games, so don't expect anything fast.  But we see huge opportunities in food as medicine.  So nutrient density, the measurement of how can we show that this tomato is different<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:06:58">0:06:58-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  than that tomato?  How can we show that connection between healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy gut systems,  healthy people, and then ultimately healthy ecosystems?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:18</a>:</strong>  There's a lot being done.  There's a lot of luckily grand capital moving into the space.  Companies are claiming all kinds of things, but I think there's still a lot of space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:18">0:07:18-0:07:28</a>:</strong>  Like what are food companies looking in the future if we take food as medicine seriously?  How it's going to look, I don't know.  We're going to see a lot of changes, I think, over the next years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:28">0:07:28-0:07:39</a>:</strong>  The other one, and Willemijn knows a lot more about that, is Lens and also actually Tecla,  landscape design.  How do we bring this region-ag discussion and regeneration of an hectare here, 10 hectares,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:39">0:07:39-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  10,000, et cetera, to a landscape scale?  How do we bring that discussion of bringing back rivers, stabilizing climate in certain  areas?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:59</a>:</strong>  We need to talk at ecosystem level and landscape levels because we're literally running out  of soil.  We need a lot of innovative companies to do that, technology, food companies that operate<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:07:59">0:07:59-0:08:11</a>:</strong>  at a landscape level, that buy the full rotation.  I literally had a discussion with Nestle, all people yesterday, and they say, we're  going to buy the full rotation, which is very interesting, at a landscape level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:11">0:08:11-0:08:26</a>:</strong>  People are thinking about it, but we need to look at a larger scale.  Landscape is, or ecosystem, or biome is really the operating principle we need to use because  otherwise we stay in very, very nice, but very, very small and marginal discussions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:26">0:08:26-0:08:34</a>:</strong>  Then ecosystem service payments, super interesting as well.  Very crowded at the moment.  A lot of people are jumping on the carbon bandwagon, obviously.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:34">0:08:34-0:08:45</a>:</strong>  Still, I think a lot of space if you look at payments for biodiversity, payments for  things that we all need.  Farmers can provide or lend stewards, but we're currently, especially through food,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:45">0:08:45-0:08:53</a>:</strong>  not paying for.  Of course, there's the subsidy train you can take, but it's very, very complicated.  We just released, did we release already?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:08:53">0:08:53-0:09:00</a>:</strong>  Anyway, an interview with a colleague of mine on how to calculate returns at a landscape  scale.  I would definitely see that as a piece as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:00">0:09:00-0:09:09</a>:</strong>  How can you start seeing all the different flows of capital and non-financial returns  that come off regenerative agriculture?  How do you get more money in the pockets of farmers?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:09">0:09:09-0:09:15</a>:</strong>  I think that's a central question.  Then the fourth, transition finance.  How do we finance all of these transitions?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:15">0:09:15-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  How do we help farmers to bridge those gaps, the yield gaps, the drops, et cetera, et cetera?  How do we make sure food companies go through the transition of sourcing different ingredients,  et cetera?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:34</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of innovative ways to travel time there to bring things forward that we  would like to see happening now.  Planting trees is an example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:34">0:09:34-0:09:42</a>:</strong>  They're an amazing investment, but it takes seven to 10 or sometimes even more years.  How do you finance that?  That's a finance question, but somebody has to build a company to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:42">0:09:42-0:09:56</a>:</strong>  The fifth theme that we've seen recently, I'm getting very excited about, and that's  why I'm so excited of the Stuart connection here, the Stuart ownership, is regenerative  enterprises, who is not only very ambitious when it comes to building soil or rebuilding<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:09:56">0:09:56-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  soil, but also extremely ambitious when it comes to everything else.  All the uncomfortable questions around inequality, land access, profit share, racism, all the  big questions agriculture forces us to ask, and we often don't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:19</a>:</strong>  I see some organizations taking that head on very, very seriously, and I'm very happy  about that.  We're planning with the podcast to follow them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:19">0:10:19-0:10:34</a>:</strong>  Thank you, Koen.  That's quite a lot, as you like to say, that's quite a lot to unpack as well.  Maybe already get a few other people involved as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:34">0:10:34-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  Again, please enter your own remarks or as Willemijn does now, share resources with us  in the chat as well so we can get you guys involved.  Maybe you mentioned Willemijn already, Koen, maybe we can ask her to jump in because you<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:11:03</a>:</strong>  mentioned landscape design as well.  Maybe Willemijn, you can briefly tell a little bit about what you're doing, who you are,  and then I wonder also what your perspective is on this question, like what are the main<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:03">0:11:03-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  problems but also what are the opportunities that you see that we need to work on?  Yeah, so first of all, thanks for inviting me.  I feel like you are really more an expert than I am, but I'll try to do my best to share<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:29</a>:</strong>  some experiences.  It's great to see Tekla here.  She's also part of our growing community of people working either on regenerative businesses<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:29">0:11:29-0:11:40</a>:</strong>  or on landscape restoration, and there is a connection.  I work for Common Land.  It's an Amsterdam-based organization engaged in enabling large-scale holistic landscape<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:40">0:11:40-0:11:56</a>:</strong>  restoration, also built on regenerative businesses.  So we believe it can be business-driven landscape restoration.  So you can actually restore soils and ecosystem functioning by doing business differently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:11:56">0:11:56-0:12:07</a>:</strong>  So it can be different products also coming out of the landscape.  This can be fiber, food, drinks, so it can be a lot of different things, and it's a really  exciting space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:07">0:12:07-0:12:23</a>:</strong>  So I think we're known for the four returns method.  So it moves away from maximization of return on investment per hectare, so getting as much  as you can out of the land in a short amount of time, towards maximization of interaction<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:23">0:12:23-0:12:35</a>:</strong>  per hectare.  So how can you create more diversity between people, between businesses, but also in terms  of biodiversity, so bringing back diversity in all its shapes and forms to move away from<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:35">0:12:35-0:12:53</a>:</strong>  this monoculture growth-oriented way of using land?  So I think carbon is an opportunity and a challenge all in one, because it's really  if you want to measure carbon, for example, on a large scale, you're going to have to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:12:53">0:12:53-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  work with proxies, and it's going to be incomplete.  So that article I just shared has a good analysis also of that.  Because carbon is just one of the multiple things you can create and actually can also<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:23</a>:</strong>  create financial streams around.  So we are looking at that space and seeing what we want to do with it, but we also sort  of don't believe the hype in a way, sort of think from an ecosystem perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:23">0:13:23-0:13:40</a>:</strong>  So how can you indeed reward land stewards for whatever they're performing on the land  in terms of producing regeneratively?  So that can be biodiversity oriented or carbon oriented or water quality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:40">0:13:40-0:13:49</a>:</strong>  But just looking at it more holistically, not just running away with carbon and forgetting  about the ecosystem.  Nevertheless, it's also a huge opportunity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:13:49">0:13:49-0:14:01</a>:</strong>  I mean, there is a lot of carbon that can be captured by soil and by different land  practices.  So definitely a beautiful development, but something to just be aware of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:01">0:14:01-0:14:19</a>:</strong>  And I really recommend reading that article, although it takes an hour to read.  And other challenges, I think a landscape approach in itself can be a bit challenging.  And I think Tekle can also talk to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:19">0:14:19-0:14:32</a>:</strong>  It's just you are effectively engaging in system change.  You are working in an ecosystem with a lot of people living there, using the land, infrastructural  projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:32">0:14:32-0:14:43</a>:</strong>  So you have to deal with everybody in that landscape.  And that's challenging.  So we're trying to also learn from the theory you community and how you can engage in a<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:43">0:14:43-0:14:52</a>:</strong>  system.  It can be education, can be health system, but in our case, it's a landscape system and  engage in different types of conversations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:14:52">0:14:52-0:15:00</a>:</strong>  So we know how to restore landscapes, basically.  We know how you can restore ecosystem functioning.  We know a lot more about how you can restore soils.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:00">0:15:00-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  But the tricky part is getting people to collaborate for longer periods of time.  So we're working with a 20 year time frame minimum, which is basically one generation  because an ecosystem needs that time to be able to regenerate and create a new stable<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:28</a>:</strong>  system basically.  But the trick is to get people to work collaboratively on longer periods of time, because often we  speak different languages, we have different stakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:28">0:15:28-0:15:36</a>:</strong>  Sometimes the funding runs dry.  So how do you engage into deeper relationship building between these stakeholders for longer  periods of time?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:36">0:15:36-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  And I'm realizing I'm going off on a rant, but I hope it's useful.  So that's a second challenge.  Maybe because I like the renting personally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:59</a>:</strong>  Maybe then we can because you mentioned Tekla as well, and we can ask her her experience  as well.  But in this bringing together multiple stakeholders and is there what is it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:15:59">0:15:59-0:16:11</a>:</strong>  Why is that difficult?  I mean, I have my ideas, but I would like to hear from your experience as well.  Like, why is it so difficult to bridge?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:11">0:16:11-0:16:23</a>:</strong>  I think because we're so used to compartmentalizing things.  Either you are either active in a value chain or you are active in in your own role in the  municipality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:23">0:16:23-0:16:38</a>:</strong>  So everything is very siloed.  So breaking through those silos and thinking from what others might also need in that same  landscape or that same piece of land requires giving in a little bit and not just thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:38">0:16:38-0:16:50</a>:</strong>  about your own stake.  Also what's challenging is the long termism thing.  So we are so used to projects three years, five years, if you're lucky.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:16:50">0:16:50-0:17:02</a>:</strong>  And of course, from a business perspective, that longer term is can be either the obvious  route or or your yeah, I don't know.  Short term, long termism is interesting from a business perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:02">0:17:02-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  But yeah, just sticking with it for a longer run.  That's the challenging thing because we we have we don't have that horizon normally.  We're so project oriented, short cycles, even in government.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:26</a>:</strong>  We have four year cycles of people being elected.  And then once they know all about the topic and start to understand it.  And I think it's a good thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:26">0:17:26-0:17:33</a>:</strong>  I mean, you don't want to have monopolies of, you know, politicians staying for too  long.  But it does create this short termism.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:33">0:17:33-0:17:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  Does that help?  Yeah, yeah, it does.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:36">0:17:36-0:17:49</a>:</strong>  I have a bunch more questions.  But maybe let's let's touch a few more people and then we can engage in a broader conversation.  So maybe Tecla, Willem, I mentioned you already.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:17:49">0:17:49-0:18:00</a>:</strong>  Maybe you could introduce yourself briefly as well.  And and and zoom in on a similar question, actually.  What kind of problems do you see now?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:00">0:18:00-0:18:12</a>:</strong>  I listen to the podcast you did with Kuhn today, actually.  You're facing quite a lot of challenges in general, I think.  But what are specific problems you also see that might be transferable to different contexts<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:12">0:18:12-0:18:16</a>:</strong>  as well?  Yeah.  Thanks, Bart.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:16">0:18:16-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  So, yeah, I'm Tecla and I am a co-founder of Grounded.  It's an organization.  We're actually based in South Africa and we work with farmers in Africa to help them switch<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  to regenerative agriculture.  And then we build businesses on the back of that, where we actually connect them to markets.  In yeah, to answer and it's kind of I've been doing this now for about seven years and encountered<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:19:01</a>:</strong>  many challenges.  I think maybe the first thing which I think is quite important to acknowledge is that  ultimately, regenerative agriculture is about farming with nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:01">0:19:01-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  And what we have been doing over the past, what, like 60 years or something is farming  against nature and more in a sort of linear.  Yeah, I don't know how to actually describe it in English, but not with nature, but it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  a more linear approach where it's like, OK, this is a spray program for this particular  farm and you need to just execute this and then you're going to kill all the pests which  are on this land if you just follow exactly these steps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:49</a>:</strong>  And this farming with nature requires a much deeper understanding of an entire system,  which is actually specific to every single farm and every single circumstance where you  are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:19:49">0:19:49-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  So it's maybe we need to all acknowledge that this is extremely hard to do.  And in particular, if you take it to a landscape approach, which you already hinted on, which  makes this even more complex.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  So it's it's definitely not something which is easy.  It's quite a beast.  And therefore, it also takes more time to create the challenges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:26</a>:</strong>  That's not to say that you cannot have like quick wins in the beginning and it's like  it is actually a lot that you can do relatively quickly and you'll see results.  But it's also hard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:26">0:20:26-0:20:40</a>:</strong>  So in the work that we do on the ground, there is just hurdle after hurdle after hurdle and  unknown after unknown after unknown.  And I think it's important that as a community, we talk about those things because then we<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:40">0:20:40-0:20:57</a>:</strong>  can actually learn and progress, just like there has been a lot of science on the sort  of conventional agricultural system.  We need a lot more knowledge sharing and science on the region system and not only saying this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:20:57">0:20:57-0:21:11</a>:</strong>  is great, please give us money.  And I think maybe two other angles that I can take like to build on what Kun was saying,  like what are sort of venture opportunities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:11">0:21:11-0:21:25</a>:</strong>  If I look at it more in ground, we take more of a value chain approach.  And I think there's quite a lot of focus on initiatives happening on a farm level.  So farmers switching to regenerative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:25">0:21:25-0:21:38</a>:</strong>  And there's also quite a lot happening on the brand side.  So brands claiming that they're going to be regenerative.  Where I see two sort of gaps is one is what happens before the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:38">0:21:38-0:21:52</a>:</strong>  So where does this farmer actually get his or her inputs?  This has been a major hurdle for us.  So regenerative seeds, organically certified seeds, what kind of microbial applications<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:21:52">0:21:52-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  can you actually use?  Fungi that you want to actually grow, how you make the right kind of compost.  So because farmers are used to actually getting consultants in who then sell them whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  kind of fertilizer or spray programs.  But in the regenerative system, they have to do something different.  They still have to use inputs which they can often actually make themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:30</a>:</strong>  But how to do that?  There's a big opportunity there, I think.  And then there's also an opportunity, I think, between the farmer and the brand where this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:30">0:22:30-0:22:45</a>:</strong>  is a system, our food system is dominated by huge companies that pile all agricultural  commodities on one heap and then ship them and transport them and make sure that everything  tastes the same.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:22:45">0:22:45-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  Where there are massive opportunities, I think, to do this differently or to work from within  those companies to change them so that products which have been produced regeneratively can  also get to the brands that are looking for these ingredients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:16</a>:</strong>  And then you can have more value transfer.  Otherwise, you lose the value because everything just goes on the one heap and it's lost.  This is an issue we are facing all the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:16">0:23:16-0:23:26</a>:</strong>  This is something we have to deal with.  Thank you very much.  Super insightful already.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:26">0:23:26-0:23:36</a>:</strong>  Koen, maybe, I don't know if you want to respond.  I have a few questions, but you're always...  I see actually Albert is asking just in terms of a bit of background, what kind of crops<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:36">0:23:36-0:23:46</a>:</strong>  are you dealing with in South Africa?  Just for people who have no idea what you're doing, just to give a bit of background when  you say ingredients, what do you mean?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:46">0:23:46-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  We don't do fresh vegetables or something like that.  We work with non-perishable high value crops.  So we're in essential oils and seed and vegetable oils.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:24:06</a>:</strong>  So those are like pressed.  And herbal tea and spices.  We're not only in South Africa, also in Zambia and in Tanzania.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:06">0:24:06-0:24:25</a>:</strong>  So a lot of these crops go for export markets.  And do you see the same issue that actually the Nestle person was discussing that issue  of as soon as you are applying regenerative approaches or practices, often farmers start<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:25">0:24:25-0:24:38</a>:</strong>  to grow different crops and obviously they need to find markets for the different crops.  Is that something you're saying, okay, we're also buying your two other, three other crops,  even though the cash crop is honey bush or is et cetera?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:38">0:24:38-0:24:49</a>:</strong>  Is that something you're figuring out how to buy the full rotation as a quote that I  think Dan Barber once quoted?  But is that something you're working on, something you're seeing, or is it getting way too complicated<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:49">0:24:49-0:24:58</a>:</strong>  because then you have to deal with three, four, five, in some cases six, seven, ten  crops.  Yeah, what we try to do is build it on the back of what the farmers are already doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:24:58">0:24:58-0:25:14</a>:</strong>  And often actually the smallholder farmers that we're working with are already selling,  they already have a range of different crops.  So they'll have maybe some maize, maybe some spices, maybe some vegetables, and they'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:14">0:25:14-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  sell a lot of the stuff into local markets.  And then we can help them capture a higher value for, for instance, these spices that  we can then actually export and get a premium for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:43</a>:</strong>  So I think, yes, this is definitely key is you want to find product market combinations  for all these crops in the system.  It's not something that necessarily we as Grounded are going to sit between the farmer<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:43">0:25:43-0:25:53</a>:</strong>  and the market for all of those things, because some of them they will actually be, ideally,  they will be able to sell them off themselves into local markets.  Yeah, but it's definitely something you need to take into account.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:25:53">0:25:53-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  If you let them grow crops, which they can't sell themselves, it totally sucks, of course,  and they're super dependent.  And they, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:02">0:26:02-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  It's a great bridge, actually.  I see that Alfredo unmuted his video.  I don't know how you say that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:15</a>:</strong>  Switch this video on.  Alfredo123, welcome.  I know you're multitasking, very, very busy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:15">0:26:15-0:26:19</a>:</strong>  Happy you're here.  Can you talk a bit about that?  Because that's in agroforestry systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:19">0:26:19-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  Obviously, you are dealing with multiple crops, especially as you're moving towards more  regenerative practices.  What do you see at that, you'll be dealing with a cash crop like cocoa or cash crop like<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:48</a>:</strong>  coffee and then what do you do with the other crops?  So thanks for having me and for inviting me.  First of all, I would like to just jump in on what was just shared before answering your<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:26:48">0:26:48-0:27:05</a>:</strong>  question.  And I think, and I second totally what was the analysis that was just done on the supply  chain and on the opportunities that can be found beside the pure play, let's say investment<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:05">0:27:05-0:27:23</a>:</strong>  at the farm level or what the claims of the brands, especially on the organic agri inputs.  I think that is an important opportunity.  And us as 123, we created an incubator exactly for tackling these kind of challenges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:23">0:27:23-0:27:47</a>:</strong>  And specifically, we are now launching an organic agri input management company.  And regarding your question, so when we set up agroforestry systems in our farms, yes,  we do have our cash crop that is primarily either cocoa or coffee.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:27:47">0:27:47-0:28:18</a>:</strong>  But we do rely on this cash crop in pairing it with other crops that for us, the first  main reason is the climate resiliency of the farm.  And also having the possibility of with these other multi cropping to have a more positive<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:18">0:28:18-0:28:29</a>:</strong>  and more profitable first cash crop.  So let's make an example that probably everybody already knows, but cocoa trees grow well in  the shade.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:29">0:28:29-0:28:50</a>:</strong>  And so for achieving this result, we plant either coconut trees or native trees or bananas.  And therefore, we enrich our product array on one side and on the other side, our cocoa  grows better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:28:50">0:28:50-0:29:19</a>:</strong>  And then obviously, in the course of the growth of the farm and on the field, the cropping  system is managed and there's some changing and optimization.  So yeah, and on what do we do with these other crops besides just having them in the shade<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:19">0:29:19-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  system and helping us with our, let's say, first crop?  Well, a lot of our effort is now geared towards finding, well, and signing sustainable off  takes, off take agreements with these brands that are claiming to want to regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:55</a>:</strong>  agriculture sourced foods.  And we've been able to do it, for example, for our bananas, we have a good contract with  a German supermarket chain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:29:55">0:29:55-0:30:04</a>:</strong>  And we are now opening for, for example, coffee and coconut oil and all the byproducts of  these of these crops.  So does that answer your question?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:04">0:30:04-0:30:14</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.  And I have a follow up question.  First of all, can you just in one or two sentences, because I obviously realize we're talking<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:14">0:30:14-0:30:21</a>:</strong>  to the in crowd here.  What is one, two, three?  And then to briefly mention, because you said something very interesting on the incubator,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:21">0:30:21-0:30:30</a>:</strong>  you're starting to build companies that are serving your farms.  And so what have you, you've launched two companies so far, what are you and then what  are you missing on that side?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:30">0:30:30-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  Like, what would you love that somebody launches?  Yes.  Okay, so in a couple of words about what wants, what is one, two, three, one, two, three is<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:31:02</a>:</strong>  an asset manager slash operator, German company that was founded in 2017.  And so far, and it targets the management and funds for institutional investors.  So our anchor investor is a group of German pension funds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:02">0:31:02-0:31:26</a>:</strong>  And we together with them and other investors, we were successfully able to basically have  more than $500 million committed to our agroforestry systems and the management of our farms and  forestry projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:26">0:31:26-0:31:42</a>:</strong>  More or less half of that is actually invested.  And we focus on agroforestry systems, climate change mitigations, local communities and  social impact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:31:42">0:31:42-0:32:02</a>:</strong>  And so we both start the farms from scratch with a greenfield approach.  Our specialty is again, Coco in Latin America.  And we have now 13 projects in seven countries, especially in Latin America.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:18</a>:</strong>  And we focus with projects at scale.  So we do not usually do small farms, but we operate on significant scales, also because  of the nature of our investors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:18">0:32:18-0:32:34</a>:</strong>  But we do also engage with smallholder farmers with programs around our big farms.  And this is obviously a pure play regenerative agriculture and agroforestry investment or  strategy if you want to call it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:34">0:32:34-0:32:52</a>:</strong>  And we soon realized that there was, as was shared before, a need for, let's call it the  value chain or the supply chain that goes around what is being done specifically on  the farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:33:09</a>:</strong>  And therefore we decided to launch this 1-2-3 Impact Incubator that so far has launched  two startups.  One is a fertilization company that has already been successfully funded in the first year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:09">0:33:09-0:33:38</a>:</strong>  And now it's tackling projects that need assistance in designing irrigation systems that bring  a lot of efficiency to the farms and allow for the applications of input in the fertigation  system and just as spraying or direct input.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:38">0:33:38-0:33:57</a>:</strong>  And the second one is instead an Agri inputs management advisor, let's call it like this.  It wants to act as a one-stop shop for Agri inputs management.  Usually again, we're starting from our experiences.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:33:57">0:33:57-0:34:16</a>:</strong>  So most of these ventures are born trying to give answers to, let's say, market failures  that we observe in our big farms.  So usually they are tailored for large scale farming operations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:16">0:34:16-0:34:33</a>:</strong>  And what we are trying to achieve with this one is instead helping these big farms and  big operations to switch to a more organic and regenerative agriculture approach.  What we are looking for next, we identified more or less five major opportunities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:33">0:34:33-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  Among these, there's definitely precision agriculture.  So drones and GIS mapping.  And this is probably one of the ventures that we are probably going to launch sooner than<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:35:00</a>:</strong>  others.  And as well, data management and all this.  But this is still far off for us at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:00">0:35:00-0:35:03</a>:</strong>  Thank you so much for that.  Sorry, Bart.  I went down a rabbit hole.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:03">0:35:03-0:35:11</a>:</strong>  That's good.  Thank you also, Alfredo.  Great to meet you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:11">0:35:11-0:35:20</a>:</strong>  We haven't properly met.  I've heard about you from Koen.  I actually also want to get back a little bit to Tecla, what she was saying, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:20">0:35:20-0:35:29</a>:</strong>  there were sort of three things that you said.  The first one was about the knowledge sharing part.  And I tend to hear that more often, I would say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:29">0:35:29-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  So maybe the rest can chip in on that as well.  And you say that there's a sort of a lack of knowledge sharing, or we should do it more  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  Maybe you can get a bit more specific on your journey, in what moments you've done things  that you would have need.  Well maybe experiences from others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:36:12</a>:</strong>  And what would be also a good way to actually get that access, elaborate a little bit further  on what's missing there, and what we should deliver there.  Yes, there's so much knowledge that you need if you do this, like if you actually do this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:12">0:36:12-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  on the ground.  I think maybe the first thing you need, like that I wish I would have known, is that it  is flipping hard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:37</a>:</strong>  And that is, I think, something that is quite useful to know before you start.  We were told that this was easy.  Like I had read about it, and I'd seen all the nice movies, like from brown to green.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:37">0:36:37-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  And I thought, OK, this is fantastic.  I'm going to actually just do this.  But it turned out it's a little bit harder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:56</a>:</strong>  You can go from brown to green, I noticed, quite quickly if you have good rain.  But that's another, exactly.  Sometimes that's actually a challenge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:36:56">0:36:56-0:37:14</a>:</strong>  What's hard on a farm level, I think, is that what I hinted on already is you need, farmers  need to acquire a different kind of set of knowledge to be able to operate their farm  regeneratively.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:14">0:37:14-0:37:21</a>:</strong>  And so you need to look at the soil differently.  You need to understand what kind of life there actually is in the soil.  You need to analyse that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:21">0:37:21-0:37:34</a>:</strong>  You need to then fix for things which are out of balance.  So if there are too many nematodes, you need to find a way to fight that without killing  them all and killing all the other life in the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:34">0:37:34-0:37:49</a>:</strong>  And it's those kinds of things which are actually very difficult.  Or for instance, deciding what kind of cover crops are you going to actually plant.  What does this particular piece of soil need in terms of nutrients?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:37:49">0:37:49-0:38:11</a>:</strong>  And then which crops can we grow here, given the soil and the water availability?  And sometimes the land maybe floods or it's very dry or whatever, you know.  So there is just a lot of knowledge that goes into actually doing this on a farm level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:11">0:38:11-0:38:30</a>:</strong>  And I think then on the back of that, what is also really hard is that once you then  have all the farming elements right, you need to then get a product that you can get to  a market for which you need to have an entirely different kind of skill set.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:40</a>:</strong>  And especially if you have new products that you want to get into new markets, for instance,  that we did with essential oils, you need to understand how do I get a good quality  essential oil?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:40">0:38:40-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  So you need to do product development tests, chemical analyses, whatever.  And then you need to understand what are actually the requirements of the different buyers?  Who are these buyers?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:39:06</a>:</strong>  How can we access them, et cetera, which is a totally different kind of skill set.  So there's just a lot of, yeah, I don't know if this kind of answers your question.  Well, I think especially on the first part that you and maybe Willemijn, I'm not sure<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:06">0:39:06-0:39:24</a>:</strong>  if you've been involved, but you talk about what do you actually need to do?  And I think ComaLand actually build a sort of a toolkit that you can sort of say what  kind of conditions you are, what kind of context you are, and you can roughly get some information<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:24">0:39:24-0:39:37</a>:</strong>  on, for example, cover crops and what to work with.  So on the one hand, I see sort of twofold thing and maybe someone else can chip in on  this or maybe Willemijn, but on the one hand, it's like almost Google it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:37">0:39:37-0:39:48</a>:</strong>  Like is there an information center?  If I understand you correctly, on the other hand, it also relates to, and I saw some questions  coming in as well, like the actual experts or the independent agronomists or people that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:39:48">0:39:48-0:40:07</a>:</strong>  can actually help you and maybe also help you on that input side.  And both of these challenges, is that a correct read?  Like that you need both of them, like the expert, but also the knowledge database that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:07">0:40:07-0:40:18</a>:</strong>  you can use?  So I shared a link to a short story, which was called the six biggest lessons learned  on regenerative agriculture, which is basically us trying to capture the knowledge in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:18">0:40:18-0:40:31</a>:</strong>  network of partners like Grounded, similar in other countries, and how they've, yeah,  what they've picked up on the road to regenerative agriculture as part of a landscape initiative,  basically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:31">0:40:31-0:40:45</a>:</strong>  And one thing that we found was that there's a huge science practice gap.  So like you mentioned, there's a lot of research backing conventional agriculture up, but there's  no equivalent amount backing regenerative up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:45">0:40:45-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  Of course, you can look at agro ecological research, there's probably more there, but  still, it's a huge gap.  And also, there's a mismatch of if, if let's say you were to pilot with a group of farmers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:09</a>:</strong>  different practices, then it's hard to find a scientist that can deal with that level  of complexity, because you're not just looking at two or three elements, you're looking at  a whole system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:09">0:41:09-0:41:17</a>:</strong>  So that also, so that was one big thing in terms of knowledge gap.  And there was another one.  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:17">0:41:17-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  So interestingly, we saw that farmer centric networks kind of were the way to go.  And farmers to exchange with each other, they're also they have a lot of knowledge already.  But just being able to experiment together, and share knowledge about that visit each<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:44</a>:</strong>  other's farms frequently invite expert speakers that can help you along that sort of learning  journey you're on, because once you understand this, you also want to understand that and  then you want to understand that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:44">0:41:44-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  So it's like, it never stops, but you just need to pull in the right people at the right  time in that farmer centric network kind of.  So that's from a sort of a helicopter view.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  That's what I saw happening.  And yeah, so the tool you mentioned, so we're trying to develop a couple of sort of, yeah,  general tools that can help sort of move towards that holistic thinking towards, for example,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  your regenerative business.  We have one tool where you can look at your farm or estate if you have one from a sort  of for a transfer perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:39</a>:</strong>  So what are the sort of things you can take into account when you look at your farm?  We also have another tool, a business model canvas, just old school, like old school business  model canvas, but then yeah, sort of twisted a little bit more towards a holistic view<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:39">0:42:39-0:42:50</a>:</strong>  and taking a landscape also into account.  But it's no means perfect, but it's just us trying to sort of pin it down and make it  tangible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:42:50">0:42:50-0:43:05</a>:</strong>  But feedback is always welcome.  Thank you, Willemijn.  We also got a bunch of questions in the chat, Koen, if you want me to unpack them very quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:05">0:43:05-0:43:18</a>:</strong>  The first one I think of Chris is, it's a very good question.  Why are we not, why are organizations we know not doing 20 million, but a billion, et cetera?  I had a discussion on that yesterday.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:18">0:43:18-0:43:35</a>:</strong>  My feeling is we're too early where we don't have the proof of concept like Willemijn is  sharing at a landscape level, at hundreds of farms, doing all kinds of different products  at a scale that we can get a billion dollars or more or a lot of money, let's say, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:35">0:43:35-0:43:44</a>:</strong>  for that you need institutional investors and they need to see a long track record.  The first investments in renewable energy or renewable energies were also not institutional  investors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:44">0:43:44-0:43:54</a>:</strong>  They were absolutely subsidized based, but still it was a slow start before we got to  the level where we are now.  So my feeling is really we're going to see these examples being built over the next years<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:43:54">0:43:54-0:44:07</a>:</strong>  and all of us will probably feel like they're too small, but they are already thinking about  the next fund or they are thinking about their next 10x time, what their need to raise to  really make a dent in the Midwest, talking about agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:07">0:44:07-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  But we're still figuring out the recipes.  We're still figuring out really we're so early on, like we have to take this as the whole  value chain or the whole value web has to be redesigned and be figured out in terms<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  of ingredients, in terms of expertise and coming to a question of Paul, farmer consultants,  it really depends who pays them.  If the input companies pay them, we know what kind of advice they give.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:40</a>:</strong>  And so that's a whole other business opportunity in terms of education for farmers.  Very tricky, very difficult, but there's a huge need to have independent farmer consultants.  So Capital is working on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:40">0:44:40-0:44:50</a>:</strong>  Others are working on it.  We need to be able to make sure that farmers have an independent advice that they can trust  that is not sold to them by an input company.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:50">0:44:50-0:44:59</a>:</strong>  Because if the incentives are aligned like that, we know what happens.  Just like Shell is going to tell you, we're going to help save petrol, which obviously  we all know is not going to happen, which is not because they're bad, it's just because<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:44:59">0:44:59-0:45:07</a>:</strong>  their business model is different.  So I feel we're really early on.  We should really crawl before we're going to run or we're going to stand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:07">0:45:07-0:45:18</a>:</strong>  And we are in the crawling phase, in many phases, in many other places, not necessarily,  but as a system, as a movement, we're super, super, super early.  And we just don't have, we cannot point the two, three things that are already raised.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:18">0:45:18-0:45:30</a>:</strong>  A lot of money have huge successes or huge acreage, et cetera.  Like New Foundation Farm still has to start and they're raising now as we speak.  And they're only raising only because it's a lot of money, but 20 million.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:30">0:45:30-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  Perennial we all see as a huge success, but they only raised 10.  And so it's really, we have to build the foundations first and these are potentially pieces of  the foundation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:49</a>:</strong>  So I hope that answers it.  Alice, I saw a question on the cultural and socioeconomic.  Access is an enormous question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:45:49">0:45:49-0:46:06</a>:</strong>  Like how do we make sure this is not again, another elite game like many of the other  food movements have been, farm to table, organic in many examples, et cetera.  How we're going to do that without some extra flow of capital in terms of subsidies or it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:06">0:46:06-0:46:14</a>:</strong>  going to be very, very tricky.  I hope we're going to move the food discussion to medicine.  And then suddenly we open up a whole different discussion in terms of insurance, in terms<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:14">0:46:14-0:46:24</a>:</strong>  of what, what am I willing to spend on health and not just on feeding myself, but that's  a long, long walk we need to do there.  So I don't know the easy answer there at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:24">0:46:24-0:46:32</a>:</strong>  It's a, it's not as accessible as it should be.  And cheap calories and processed calories are way more accessible.  So that that's very difficult.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:32">0:46:32-0:46:44</a>:</strong>  And there also, there's a huge etiquette, like we are what we eat literally.  But most people are a lot of people don't see it.  If you see what a lot of people throw in their supermarket basket, when you, when you are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:44">0:46:44-0:46:54</a>:</strong>  at your local supermarket, you'll be shocked or you are shocked probably because most of  it is simply not food.  I mean, Nestle did an internal research which came out unfortunately for them in the financial<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:46:54">0:46:54-0:47:06</a>:</strong>  time, I'll put a link below that 65% of their products can never be claimed healthy.  And so they have huge issues of with the new supermarket, with the new traffic light system  of is it green or not?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:06">0:47:06-0:47:13</a>:</strong>  Like can it be named healthy in France and Australia?  They're already doing that.  Most of our products are simply too salty and too sweet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:13">0:47:13-0:47:25</a>:</strong>  And so they know that, but how are you going to change a behemoth like that doing, I checked  it yesterday, 93 billion a year.  So it's, that's a very, I mean, cheap calories are cheap and not very cheap if you take into<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:25">0:47:25-0:47:36</a>:</strong>  of course, true cost accounting could potentially fix some of that.  But that's a, it's a very difficult one.  How do we keep this accessible to all, especially to the people that need it most that are eating<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:36">0:47:36-0:47:43</a>:</strong>  the worst food at the moment.  And we, because we potentially all here on the call are already shopping locally, are  already making choices differently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:43">0:47:43-0:47:48</a>:</strong>  So there's not too much to win honestly when you look at us.  Yeah.  Maybe I can chip in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:47:48">0:47:48-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  But I think on a farmer level, that's I think relevant to think about, cause I think most  of the pioneering examples that you see on regenerative farms that get everything right  are people that also had the cash to spend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:05">0:48:05-0:48:14</a>:</strong>  And this is something which is very frustrating for some of the farmers that we've been working  with because then you point them to those examples.  You say, look, you can hear it's possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:14">0:48:14-0:48:21</a>:</strong>  And then they're like, yeah, okay.  But this guy had a shitload of money and that's how he made it possible.  You know?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:21">0:48:21-0:48:37</a>:</strong>  So it's those examples can be inspiring to outsiders, but they can be super frustrating  and actually off putting to farmers who are just common farmers and who have to make ends  meet and are like, yeah, but that's just unattainable for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:37">0:48:37-0:48:50</a>:</strong>  So then you have to go like smaller steps, things which are immediately interesting to  them, like reducing input costs by making their own compost tea, for instance, which  immediately can fertilize their crops and they can see the results.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:48:50">0:48:50-0:49:06</a>:</strong>  So those are things that we are also working on.  It's like, how can you make this transition affordable to farmers who have very little  to spend without having to always resort to massive subsidies, for instance?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:06">0:49:06-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  I think that's a very exciting thing to think about.  How can you make this show a poor farmer that a small investment can lead to an immediate  return?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:27</a>:</strong>  Which I think is possible in some cases, like maybe not for the full transition, but in  many cases, I think you can actually do things there as well.  Yeah, thank you both.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:27">0:49:27-0:49:35</a>:</strong>  Thank you.  We have a bunch of more questions, but maybe, I don't know, Alice or Chris could answer  your questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:35">0:49:35-0:49:51</a>:</strong>  I'm not sure if any of you wants to respond or has additional questions.  Well, I would jump in.  Yeah, I would ask, I want to poke around, Khun, your thoughts on new foundation farms<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:49:51">0:49:51-0:50:11</a>:</strong>  related also to what Tekla said about having a lot of money and being able to put into  a farm this decent amount of capital and then wanting to showcase or demonstrate regenerative  agriculture as the way to go for other farmers to copy in a nearby location.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:11">0:50:11-0:50:26</a>:</strong>  Is there, do you see evidence of that or do you see potential challenges there?  I'd also like to, if possible, briefly hear a little bit from Tekla about some of the  more specific challenges that you face, whether it's expanding the amount of farmers that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:26">0:50:26-0:50:39</a>:</strong>  you're working with or expanding to another geographical location, the specific things  that are really bottlenecks for you in that context.  You want to go first, Tekla?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:39">0:50:39-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  No, you can go.  So on new foundation farms, just for anybody who doesn't know, they are raising 20 million,  buying a thousand acres in the UK, potentially scaling that a number of times and being a<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:51:02</a>:</strong>  fully regenerative, fully integrated regenerative food enterprise, agri-food enterprises, they  call it.  And we're following them with the podcast because I find them extremely ambitious, a<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:02">0:51:02-0:51:15</a>:</strong>  very interesting team and doing things very differently, like Chris is saying.  And I'm interested because they do things at a certain scale or they are going to try  to do things at a certain scale, which maybe unlocks certain things that we, that an individual<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:15">0:51:15-0:51:31</a>:</strong>  farmer can't, meaning building a proper food brand, selling it to the city, having a farm  shop that operates year round and actually drives a lot of the value back to the land,  having more than a hundred people on staff and operating at a scale that there is an<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:31">0:51:31-0:51:39</a>:</strong>  economy of scale, like let's not deny that.  It's a very different thing, obviously, because they start with a sort of clean slate.  They will buy the land, they can do whatever they want with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:39">0:51:39-0:51:46</a>:</strong>  They will never sell it.  So they have a very long term, at least plan.  Let's see what they will be following that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:46">0:51:46-0:51:57</a>:</strong>  So I'm very curious about that because it shows a different operating system or different  model at a different scale that according to them makes sense in the UK, very context  specific, obviously.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:51:57">0:51:57-0:52:03</a>:</strong>  So let's see.  I don't know.  I think once you have that brand standing, you can sell a lot of the food through the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:03">0:52:03-0:52:12</a>:</strong>  food brand and proper marketing, proper design.  If you see their data room, they thought about this a lot and they have a lot of experience  with selling food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:12">0:52:12-0:52:24</a>:</strong>  I think you can absorb a lot of other food from the area, from farmers that are nearby  and make this transition a lot easier for people that don't want to, like I said in  the chat, every farmer needs a market that don't want to set up their own food brand,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:24">0:52:24-0:52:36</a>:</strong>  that don't necessarily want to do that because you don't want to wear 15 different hats and  they want to have access to the best technology that you can have if you share it with a major  hub like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:36">0:52:36-0:52:50</a>:</strong>  So I think if you offer a good market and have a good sense of the quality and the regenerative  practices, then this could be very interesting, could fail completely in a couple of years  and we look back like this was really, this was a bad shot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:50">0:52:50-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  But I think we need to be ambitious.  We need to be bold in the current times.  We need to question a lot of things about agriculture and one of them is the single<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:53:08</a>:</strong>  family farm with a small farm shop and we all hope that that will save the world because  I think there are a lot of issues with that.  So we need professional organizations and companies as well running some of these and<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:08">0:53:08-0:53:22</a>:</strong>  so let's see where they get.  Yeah, I will go quickly.  I think on the model, the model farm thing and then having other farmers copy that is<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:22">0:53:22-0:53:35</a>:</strong>  I think very often challenging because in the model farm you, like I just mentioned,  you then invest a lot of resources and then for the other farmers surrounding that farm  can sometimes be difficult to get to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:35">0:53:35-0:53:51</a>:</strong>  So that's one comment.  In terms of barriers to scale for Grounded, for us the success in our model lies in making  it successful for the farmers because that will allow us to scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:53:51">0:53:51-0:54:03</a>:</strong>  So if we can make this work financially for farmers that we work with, then we can also  scale and barriers there.  I think there are two which we are now addressing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:03">0:54:03-0:54:19</a>:</strong>  One is money because you often need to have some kind of capital to get this whole thing  started.  So we're looking at raising our own fund within Grounded to be able to scale more rapidly<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:19">0:54:19-0:54:33</a>:</strong>  and have a little bit more leeway that we can actually choose areas which we think are  interesting and get started.  And the other thing is market access and for that we are an access to the right kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:33">0:54:33-0:54:52</a>:</strong>  market and for that we are launching a platform hopefully next week which is geared towards  giving regenerative suppliers access to niche brands.  So kind of bridging that gap that I was talking about earlier, we're looking for regeneratively<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:54:52">0:54:52-0:55:11</a>:</strong>  produced ingredients and then hopefully getting those suppliers a better price.  And that will hopefully also allow us to scale more rapidly because then we can onboard all  kinds of different suppliers who we can then provide support to get better at regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:11">0:55:11-0:55:21</a>:</strong>  agriculture.  So we see that market link as a sort of scaling mechanism so we can reach many more suppliers  than we are currently doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:21">0:55:21-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  Nice, thanks for that.  By the way that's very exciting, two nice initiatives that you're kind of folding into  that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:29">0:55:29-0:55:35</a>:</strong>  I'm looking forward to see that platform.  I wish you guys the best.  Yes we're crunching at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:35">0:55:35-0:55:50</a>:</strong>  Well not me as you can see but my colleagues.  All right, thank you Tecla.  We're also almost already at the end, it's a one hour conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:55:50">0:55:50-0:56:04</a>:</strong>  We're going to do this way more often and maybe zoom in on the specific parts of what  we addressed today even to get a little bit more detail.  Maybe Daniel to mention you, Kun, you responded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:04">0:56:04-0:56:22</a>:</strong>  Well you mentioned, if I say your name right Daniel, Cezano, correct me please.  You mentioned a few things, maybe it's a good closing remark as well because you just you  mentioned a few ideas that you think are going to be relevant in the space and maybe Kun<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:22">0:56:22-0:56:35</a>:</strong>  you can respond on it as a final remark.  So well basically just present myself, I'm Daniel Cezano, founder of Adapta, it's a  startup that works in Brazil on regenerative agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:35">0:56:35-0:56:55</a>:</strong>  I currently have joined the IDB, the Inter-American Development Bank.  I'm helping them invest part of their fund in a larger portfolio on regenerative agriculture.  We're creating a green hub to invest basically with the best, largest multinational companies<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:56:55">0:56:55-0:57:12</a>:</strong>  in Latin America in regenerative agriculture and I'm also a farmer.  So I'm on a small farm here in Rio de Janeiro.  What I see is that a lot of people usually they talk about transitional finance but for<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:12">0:57:12-0:57:28</a>:</strong>  me this is a second bit, is a key.  If you don't have a system to manage the transition at scale then you cannot have transitional  finance because transitional finance is a scale issue.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:28">0:57:28-0:57:41</a>:</strong>  And then we have companies like 1 to 3 that they actually have the expertise in the whole  house that they've developed their own system.  But how many companies do we need to create to develop this sort of system?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:41">0:57:41-0:57:57</a>:</strong>  So I think that developing a mechanism, a clear mechanism that tries these processes  and manages the transition at scale that will be actually very important because when you  do that you start collecting data and then you're going to have artificial intelligence<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:57:57">0:57:57-0:58:10</a>:</strong>  and then you're going to have all the satellite data with carbon.  Our regional network is doing a great thing with satellite images for monitoring carbon  which can be linked to blockchain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:10">0:58:10-0:58:28</a>:</strong>  You can have traceable products with traceable impacts and ultimately we can up with a marketplace  online platform that eventually can substitute current trading structures.  You can actually, in my opinion, that's where we have to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:28">0:58:28-0:58:40</a>:</strong>  Create trading mechanisms large scale that are going to sell tradable products with tradable  impacts.  And I think that's when we're actually going to start working at the landscape level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:40">0:58:40-0:58:53</a>:</strong>  So this should be my take on how I actually see the market evolving.  Thank you Daniela, good to see you.  I think we're on top of the, not on top of the hour, on the bottom of the hour so I'd<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:53">0:58:53-0:58:58</a>:</strong>  rather give it back to you.  Yeah, yeah.  I see there's a lot to be built here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:58:58">0:58:58-0:59:05</a>:</strong>  Almost every piece of the value chain has to be, value web has to be rebuilt so we better  get to work.  I think so as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:05">0:59:05-0:59:17</a>:</strong>  I'm going to wrap it up for today.  First of all, thank you very much all for coming.  As I said in the beginning, we recorded the session so I will follow up with all of you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:17">0:59:17-0:59:33</a>:</strong>  I'll try to capture some of the links in this chat as well, make sure that that is in an  email together with the registration so you can watch it again.  We are currently with Fresh working hard on this mission, trying to get more teams working<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:33">0:59:33-0:59:45</a>:</strong>  on these challenges.  So if you know people who want to work in this space, especially we are starting up  a cohort at the end of this year trying to build these new organizations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=0:59:45">0:59:45-1:00:03</a>:</strong>  So also on the input side like ideas or problems that you run into, but especially on the talent  side currently we are very much open for people that want to build new ventures in this space.  So yeah, please share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:03">1:00:03-1:00:19</a>:</strong>  We will have a next event actually on the 7th of July, which is a Fresh Talks around  a similar subject that we will invite probably three different pioneers in this space to  tell more on a specific use case that we can dive into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:19">1:00:19-1:00:31</a>:</strong>  This is more of an open conversation and probably Koen and I will host another conversation  like this at the end of July.  Let's see how it goes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:31">1:00:31-1:00:43</a>:</strong>  If you have any ideas on maybe a more focused discussion or topics that you would like to  get into in this conversation arena, I would say, or you would like to have some speaking  time, please reach out to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:43">1:00:43-1:00:53</a>:</strong>  You can either email me or do it via LinkedIn.  But yeah, let's get this conversation going.  I think there's a lot more than we could cover today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:00:53">1:00:53-1:01:07</a>:</strong>  And especially also thanks for Willemijn and Tecla for being here and sharing your story.  So thank you very much.  And I hope to see you the 7th of July.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:07">1:01:07-1:01:20</a>:</strong>  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:20">1:01:20-1:01:31</a>:</strong>  Why are we doing this course?  After 100 interviews and more than 100 hours of audio asking the question how to put money  to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011 and recording<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:31">1:01:31-1:01:41</a>:</strong>  these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:41">1:01:41-1:01:47</a>:</strong>  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:47">1:01:47-1:01:51</a>:</strong>  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:51">1:01:51-1:01:56</a>:</strong>  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:01:56">1:01:56-1:02:10</a>:</strong>  You the soil builders and investors in the space, the soil builders, people working in  the space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform  builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line designers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:10">1:02:10-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  holistic management consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:29</a>:</strong>  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:29">1:02:29-1:02:36</a>:</strong>  No.  It is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:36">1:02:36-1:02:47</a>:</strong>  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:47">1:02:47-1:02:52</a>:</strong>  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:02:52">1:02:52-1:03:06</a>:</strong>  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to ride along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:06">1:03:06-1:03:17</a>:</strong>  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co investors you could find, or what kind of investors you could  find if you're a soil builder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:17">1:03:17-1:03:31</a>:</strong>  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:31">1:03:31-1:03:36</a>:</strong>  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:36">1:03:36-1:03:47</a>:</strong>  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com#t=1:03:47">1:03:47-1:03:57</a>:</strong>  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.  Click on the link below, sign up and I'm really looking forward to your feedback.  </p>
