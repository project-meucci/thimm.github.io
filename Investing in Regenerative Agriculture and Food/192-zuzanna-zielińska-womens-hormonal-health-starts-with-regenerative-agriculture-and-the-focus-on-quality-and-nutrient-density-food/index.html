<p><strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:14</a>:</strong>  Healthy soils lead to healthy produce, lead to healthy gut system and lead to healthy people.  The 60 pages of references on the book of Anne Bickley and David R Montgomery clearly show this connection.  If you want to know more, we interviewed them before and I will put a link below.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:14">0:00:14-0:00:35</a>:</strong>  So how can we use this fact to build scalable companies and reach the people that are currently not being reached?  Our guests today decided to focus on women's hormonal health and specifically polycystic ovary syndrome, PCOS,  which is the most common endocrine, which is hormonal disorder for women of reproductive age.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:35">0:00:35-0:00:46</a>:</strong>  About 20% of women suffer from this.  Why? Because all the toxicity in our current food system masses with our hormones  and this can be managed by lifestyle changes and more importantly, diets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:00:49">0:00:49-0:01:06</a>:</strong>  What are the connections between healthy farming practices, healthy soil, healthy produce, healthy gut and healthy people?  Welcome to a special series where we go deep into the relationship between regenerative agriculture practices  that build soil health and the nutritional quality of the food we end up eating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:06">0:01:06-0:01:19</a>:</strong>  We unpack the current state of science, the role of investments, businesses, nonprofits, entrepreneurs and more.  This series is supported by the 18 Foundation, who support food and land projects that are ecologically,  economically and socially conscious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:19">0:01:19-0:01:32</a>:</strong>  They contribute to a wider movement that envisions a future where real food is produced by enlightened agriculture  and access to it is equal.  The 18 Foundation are looking to make more investments and grants in the space of bio-nutrients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:32">0:01:32-0:01:54</a>:</strong>  You can find more here, 18foundation.org or get in touch directly info at 18foundation.org  or check the information in the show notes below.  Welcome to another episode today with the founder of Harvest Care, Susanna,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:01:54">0:01:54-0:02:04</a>:</strong>  which we go deep into nutrient density, potentially my favorite subject of this podcast.  So I'm very, very happy to have Susanna here.  Welcome and thank you so much for joining us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:04">0:02:04-0:02:19</a>:</strong>  Thank you so much for being here.  So we met, I will put the link below, obviously with the interview we did with Bart through Fresh Ventures,  but I would love to, which is a venture studio based in Rotterdam focused on regenerative agriculture and food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:19">0:02:19-0:02:32</a>:</strong>  I would love to know a bit more about how, like your story, how did you end up focusing on soil  and then focusing on the health side of humans and that connection to healthy soil?  Like what's the meandering river into that or what's the story into that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:33">0:02:33-0:02:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so I was very, very lucky because I have studied global health nutrition in Denmark.  And then our first semester we had half a year dedicated for agriculture.  And I remember sitting in that class and being...<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:02:51">0:02:51-0:03:03</a>:</strong>  I don't think that's normal just for anybody that I don't think many of these studies take,  okay, let's start at the basis, let's start at soil.  I think that's, you were lucky or did you pick that one specifically for that or you just...<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:03">0:03:03-0:03:13</a>:</strong>  No, no, it was just the design of the program.  And, you know, I remember sitting in the class and being taught about no till agriculture.  And back then, like, it didn't make any sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:13">0:03:13-0:03:25</a>:</strong>  I was like, what the heck is happening?  And then we even would go to like 30 kilometers from where my university was.  We had one of the only, I think, organic farming school in whole Europe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:25">0:03:25-0:03:38</a>:</strong>  So we'd also have a tour out there.  And yeah, as you said, like, I'm super lucky.  I think, like, I would assume that it's one of the only universities in Europe that actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:38">0:03:38-0:03:50</a>:</strong>  taught about the food production in quite a bit.  And I think from then on, something clicked, like, something really clicked very deep in  me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:03:52">0:03:52-0:04:11</a>:</strong>  I think I never really resonate with the approach to dieting as, you know, something that you  use to restrict your calories and something that you do to have your summer body.  And I think there is so much toxicity coming from all sorts of industries that benefit<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:11">0:04:11-0:04:26</a>:</strong>  on people, yeah, on making people feel uncomfortable in what they eat and how they look.  And I think that was it.  That was for me, like, a completely different look and a completely different approach to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:26">0:04:26-0:04:39</a>:</strong>  our food and what food means to us and to our ecosystem.  And I think from then on, it was just like a continuous path towards soil and agriculture.  But you didn't become a farmer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:39">0:04:39-0:04:46</a>:</strong>  Like, you decided to, or did you try that?  Like, what's the, did you go, what was the obvious next step after that study for you?  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:04:57</a>:</strong>  So, yeah, that was one of the first semesters.  I still had, like, many semesters to come because I actually just graduated my bachelor  like half a year ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:04:57">0:04:57-0:05:08</a>:</strong>  So everything is quite fresh.  And yeah, so I was, we had the chance to go on an internship and I, back then I was working  in a coffee shop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:08">0:05:08-0:05:18</a>:</strong>  So it was kind of natural flow for me to work with a certain ingredient and to really wanting  to discover of, you know, what is the whole life cycle of the certain ingredients I wanted  to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:18">0:05:18-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  I was planning to go on a coffee farm to Guatemala to discover the difference between organic  and conventional coffee production.  Then Corona happened.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:31">0:05:31-0:05:43</a>:</strong>  So that, of course, grounded me in Denmark.  So I was very, I was gifted with the time to just, you know, have to freeze my time  and do something with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:05:43">0:05:43-0:06:05</a>:</strong>  So I started to volunteer in an urban community farm, which also worked as a care farm.  So they managed to get finances for people with mental challenges to employ them as gardeners,  as food producers to heal through reconnecting nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:05">0:06:05-0:06:16</a>:</strong>  And this is where, yeah, where the first step of taking, learning something in class and  then going to, you know, visiting farming school and then starting ideating about it  and then putting my hands into action.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:16">0:06:16-0:06:36</a>:</strong>  And I think that was definitely one of the most impactful months of my life where I wasn't  just being taught about something periodically, but actually I put my hands dirty.  And this is also where the, especially the love to soil started because I was like really<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:36">0:06:36-0:06:57</a>:</strong>  ideating how can I help them the most in this small half and a hectare farm.  And it really came to digging deeper into composting and seeing how I can utilize the  organic materials from the city that are abandoned as, for example, coffee waste, which I could<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:06:57">0:06:57-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  bring from, you know, after my shift, I would put it in my backpack and I would buy the  coffee waste to a compost that we have built and really trying to enrich the soil quality  there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:20</a>:</strong>  And this is how it started.  I think many people underestimate the power of gardening or farming at like in with those  intentions or those practices.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:20">0:07:20-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  I don't think anybody would argue, let's have a, let's say a care farm on a large extractive  GMO fed soil.  Like nobody would go there to get healed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  Like that's not another approach, but somehow it really naturally fits, which is, I just  realized it now, which it really is an interesting way.  Like you would go to farms like this to get a good, you know, a good, you know, a good<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:53</a>:</strong>  way to get healed, not only because you're doing physical work and there's the structure  and all of that, but also because there is something with working with your hands in  the soil, of course, healthy soil that, that apparently seems to be healing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:07:53">0:07:53-0:08:04</a>:</strong>  Did you like, what, what was the biggest, I mean, you said it clicked with you.  Was there a specific moment or was there some, like something you saw like, okay, there's,  there's more than just, okay, this is nice because we're working outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:11</a>:</strong>  You could also do woodworking, but this is different.  This is, there's something different about working with soil and working with food.  What, do you remember when it clicked for you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:13">0:08:13-0:08:30</a>:</strong>  I actually visited this urban farm already a few times before and just each time, like  just tapping, you know, there'll be a pavement and stepping out of the concrete into the  soil, like already would have such a transformational effect on, on, on, on, on my body and my spirit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:30">0:08:30-0:08:48</a>:</strong>  But, I think that the society that we live in and, and, you know, the prevalent consumerism  capitalists really make us feel so inadequate and so like feeling of lack all the time.  And being there with, with people with, you know, with, with schizophrenia and depression<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:08:48">0:08:48-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  and all kinds of people that I would never imagine and being so grateful and honored  that I can, I can be around people that, that leave completely different stories than I  and still would, you know, would have developed a deep bond over, over planting sunflowers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:22</a>:</strong>  And I would, I would just be able to see how other people interact with nature of some,  you know, singing to the plants that they were harvesting, that they believe in, you know,  little fairies that are taking care of, of, of the wellbeing of the plants, which now I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:22">0:09:22-0:09:34</a>:</strong>  about soil microbiome and the soil food web. They are the fairies.  Of course. They see things we don't see,  doesn't mean they're not there. Exactly. And I mean, maybe we can see them as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:34">0:09:34-0:09:51</a>:</strong>  If we take microscope, but they just feel they are there, you know? So I think, I think for the  first time in my life, I felt that I so deeply belong without having to prove anything. So rather  than, you know, it was not that me, I was helping the garden and the people that the garden was<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:09:51">0:09:51-0:10:10</a>:</strong>  hitting me and I felt firsthand experience of what it means to feel welcome. And yeah.  Very interesting. There's, I think the documentary out there to where we belong,  something like that on farming as well. I'll put a link below it's streamable, I think for<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:10">0:10:10-0:10:23</a>:</strong>  $10 or something, you can get it. Anyway, it's a very interesting sentence you've mentioned,  but then you could have stayed there. You could have worked in your shifts in the coffee place.  You could have biked with the coffee leftover. I'm not going to call it waste because it's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:23">0:10:23-0:10:45</a>:</strong>  with the coffee opportunity to, to this farm and you interned there and you were a volunteer there.  And that would be a very fulfilling path, but you chose to take a different route.  Yeah. So I think the coffee, the coffee like really awakened me. And I know that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:10:45">0:10:45-0:11:02</a>:</strong>  this coffee awakes us every morning, but for me, it was much more on like a spiritual level that  the coffee awakened me to start reading. How much did you take?  Yeah, exactly. Basically I understood that the coffee is like a systemic problem. So I visit<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:02">0:11:02-0:11:21</a>:</strong>  every single coffee shop in my city, which was around 35 places. And I asked, what do you do  with your coffee? And beside one lady that was using it in her own garden, everybody else was  just throwing it away. And of course, this is not just coffee that is such an abandoned organic<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:21">0:11:21-0:11:44</a>:</strong>  material in the city that we could be utilizing to make topsoil. And I think something that really  also encouraged me to do the topsoil is that the FAO conclusions that we have 60 years of  harvest left, but it was released a few years ago. So now we have 55 years of harvest left.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:12:00</a>:</strong>  And I was like, how is it possible that we are all not just making a topsoil? We're arguing if  we should go on keto diet or vegan diet or paleo diet, but at the same time, we have 50 years to  make a crucial problem. None of these diets matters if we don't have topsoil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:01">0:12:01-0:12:17</a>:</strong>  Maybe you go to an algae diet, you're sort of escaping that, but still.  So I asked everybody what they are doing and nobody was doing really anything. And then they  started to teach other community gardens of how they can build compost and how they can connect<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:17">0:12:17-0:12:36</a>:</strong>  with the local entrepreneurs to take their bio ways. But I quickly realized that just running it  on my own, just as a volunteer, it was a systemic problem, basically. So systemic problem is a  systemic solution. So then I thought, okay, well, nobody really cares what I'm doing in my free time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:36">0:12:36-0:12:51</a>:</strong>  But if I say that I will turn it to a product, or if I'm basically just want to step into the  market, suddenly you gain so much momentum and traction and people start listening and inviting  you places. So I said, okay, let me try to figure out what can you do with coffee ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:12:53">0:12:53-0:13:09</a>:</strong>  besides composting. Even I still believe that composting is the greatest way to deal with it.  And I reached out to people. I just reached out on Facebook, like, hey, I want to deal with this  problem that somebody wants to join me. And I was very lucky because I got three people joining,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:09">0:13:09-0:13:30</a>:</strong>  then two people from my activist group also joined. And this is how we form Connecting  Grunge. Connecting Grunge is a startup which works on upcycling coffee waste into food products.  And right now there's a lot of upcycling happening and coffee is a very diverse material that you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:30">0:13:30-0:13:50</a>:</strong>  use to various applications from biomaterials like bioplastic to cosmetics to pharmaceuticals.  But I think being a nutritionist and always putting the importance of us first and foremost  feeding ourselves rather than putting something on our skin or having a shoe made of coffee grass,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:13:50">0:13:50-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  like it's great. But if you can eat it, eat it. And we figure out that it's very simple to  upcycle it. All you need to do is have a drier coffee waste, mill it to the right particle and  you can use it. You can use this flower. So it's naturally gluten free. It's really high in fiber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:26</a>:</strong>  It has 60 to 70% of fiber. It has some of the minerals.  Basically, we're talking about the leftover. So you make your espresso, you make your French  press, and then you always have this sort of cake left, which is I think 96, 97% of the coffee bean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:26">0:14:26-0:14:42</a>:</strong>  There's a very small percentage in your coffee, which is great. That's the whole industry. And  the rest is, but you say you can simply grind it and it becomes flour, which is very interesting.  Yeah. And then the crisis part of it is that once you extract the caffeine content that you extract<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:14:42">0:14:42-0:15:03</a>:</strong>  to your cup of coffee, it's almost nothing. You extract 200 milligrams of caffeine in your espresso  cup. And then we run the test through a lab and in the leftovers of coffee grounds, you have around  600 milligrams of caffeine. Can you imagine? We are only extracting one fourth of all of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:03">0:15:03-0:15:20</a>:</strong>  caffeine that is available from this resource that travels from Latin America and Africa.  And it was so much work, so much energy. And then we have 25 seconds for this, you know,  tiny cup and that's it. That's it. And when you say we can eat it as flour,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:20">0:15:20-0:15:37</a>:</strong>  what makes you say then you still believe that compost is better as the composting is? Is it  better or is it equally? Why would you say that if there's the option to eat it?  Yeah. So, I mean, first and foremost, I question if we have a healthy diet and we follow the,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:37">0:15:37-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  you know, the lifestyle medicine approach where we take care of our, you know, nutrition and  physical activity and sleep, and we have the contact with other humans and stress management,  like, will we really need a coffee to wake up? I think if we're, you're the coffee to wake up,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  you know, there's few problems before that, that you should look at rather than just going for  easy quick. Good point.  It's a solution. So, yeah. So, as the person that just had a coffee just before this interview,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:22</a>:</strong>  that's me. I'm not a shamer, like coffee is delicious. I'm also having it from time to time  as a treat. So basically my problem is that, so when I started looking into the, you know,  the whole supply chain of coffee, like I always wanted to create a startup with a thought of<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:22">0:16:22-0:16:38</a>:</strong>  bringing new economical strengths from the farmers because we now with that of the climate change,  especially the farmers who cultivate Arabica will most likely in 25 years to 30 years,  most of the land will be unusable because Arabica needs very specific conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:40">0:16:40-0:16:52</a>:</strong>  So we need to drastically rethink how much we use of our coffee. We are like, we are  drinking as it would be water as it would be something that, you know, you're just like,  yeah, I just go to my garden and I pick up my coffee beans. Like I didn't see, well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:16:52">0:16:52-0:17:09</a>:</strong>  actually in Italy now with the climate change, you're able to grow a coffee very south of Italy,  but still like I don't see coffee bushes just like abundant in Holland where I am.  And you're treating it as it would be abundant. And so right now I'm not in the startup anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:09">0:17:09-0:17:25</a>:</strong>  I decided to exit it because I came in and I embarked on this new adventure and I really  wanted to commit to a general culture. And I knew that this is my path and I was keep on pushing my  team like, Hey guys, but like, let's remember the farmers, remember the culture. And that was just<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:25">0:17:25-0:17:40</a>:</strong>  not fitting the whole solution. So, because it's so far like that the coffee farmers are on the  other side. And in this case, you're providing a solution for the quote unquote waste. And of  course it doesn't impact, it impacts a full energy side, life cycle assessment, et cetera,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:40">0:17:40-0:17:56</a>:</strong>  but doesn't impact the farmer whatsoever. And so it makes it made a lot of sense, but not easy to,  to, because you sort of also become part of that startup. Like your identity is part of that,  like, and then having to not having wanting to exit that and take that road to either left or<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:17:56">0:17:56-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  right, whatever the cut is, is not a, is not an easy step. And then, Ooh, I mean, then you came  to fresh, you came to Rotterdam, like that's quite a drastic, a drastic cut. It was a really drastic  cut. And when I was, when I was here during the program, I was still with that, with my startup.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:28</a>:</strong>  And, and, and as you said, it became a huge part of identity. You become obsessed, right. And it's  just so deep. You want to fix this problem and you, you know, you, the knowing more,  they would know you want them the more, the more, you know, the more you want to get engaged. But<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:28">0:18:28-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  I just felt that because we are dealing with upcycling on the upstream, the more  I could, the closer we were getting to go on the market, the less my motivation was there,  because the more I understood that we'll have to still deal with, with, you know, the current<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:19:06</a>:</strong>  food supply chain, which is maybe upcycling this coffee waste, and then trying to sell it to a B2B  product that can, you know, use it to, yeah, have a sustainable ingredient. And it's just like,  I think I'm a bit too extreme into what has to happen to be able to go on those compromises.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:06">0:19:06-0:19:18</a>:</strong>  And I just, I just, yeah, it just was too difficult for me.  So how did you find Fresh?  Well, they actually reached out to my, my best friend, Marco Nardini,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:18">0:19:18-0:19:34</a>:</strong>  which is a regenerative agronomist. And he loves your podcast.  I don't think we ever met, but I see you on LinkedIn.  Yeah. And then they reach out to him because they have been really wide reach and he is,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:34">0:19:34-0:19:45</a>:</strong>  yeah, he's really engaged with what he was doing in the economy. So,  so it wasn't for him at this moment. And he thought, Oh, maybe this is something for you.  And I look at it and I was like, Oh, maybe, you know, back then I was still writing my<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:19:45">0:19:45-0:20:02</a>:</strong>  bachelor. So it was, I was still in a different mindset, but I thought, okay, you know what, like,  let me try. And I was just applying. And it's so interesting that most of those things in my life  that really have a huge impact, they are the ones that I put the least effort in a sense,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:02">0:20:02-0:20:10</a>:</strong>  you know, because I was just like, yeah, whatever.  There's a lesson there.  There is a lesson there for sure. Like the more, yeah. And so I just, so I just did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:12">0:20:12-0:20:27</a>:</strong>  Perfect. And then like, what was that? Because we've talked to Bart, but it was beforehand,  actually, before the program started, I will link it below, but what was the experience like? I  mean, I was a bit involved, but obviously not inside, inside. What was that process of going<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:27">0:20:27-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  through a venture studio, first the online bit, which I remember then it was very intense offline  in person. And then you came out basically joining the studio with, with a company like,  let's we'll go there at the end, but like, how was that process for you? It sounds very intense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:21:04</a>:</strong>  It was extremely intense. And also extremely, like it was the most growth period time of my life that  I think set me off on this path, but not only me, I mean, what's so beautiful about the Fresh Studio  is that they believe that you first invest in people and then this investment will pay back<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:04">0:21:04-0:21:23</a>:</strong>  in creating a solution with a real impact. So they invited 35 people with all different,  you know, paths of life. I mean, I don't think there was two people in the room that would have  the same background. And they just throw us to a huge room and say, okay, 12 weeks, try to figure<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:23">0:21:23-0:21:37</a>:</strong>  something out. So of course there was so much, you know, like we get to know each other through  online program, but it's such a different dynamic. And then you go and you're like,  oh, you actually way taller or, you know, like, I didn't expect you have this kind of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:37">0:21:37-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it was a very intense online piece. I think on a lot of the knowledge, I mean,  you knew already, but like going deep in food and ag, and then you moved offline in person and still  visited a lot of farms, a lot of food companies and things like that. And then really started<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:22:06</a>:</strong>  working on solution paths and at some point, okay, what kind of companies or solutions could grow out  of this? How was that switch from offline to online? What happened there? Because it was still  also in COVID times. It was interesting, but like you got into this pressure cooker and knew, okay,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:06">0:22:06-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  for 12 weeks, we're going to be here thinking, building, iterating, being uncomfortable.  Like what was that? Like, did it fly? Was it very long? What was the, your feeling over in that in  person piece? I think like, you know, if you would ask each of the members, like for sure, everybody<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:42</a>:</strong>  would have a different story to that. Right. And then because for some, it was coming from abroad  to Rotterdam. So it was also like a life changing event for some that they're actually that, or they  live here. And I think like the online program was a really great start for all of us to get the kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:42">0:22:42-0:22:59</a>:</strong>  of basic knowledge. What basic, well, it was not really basic, but you know, knowledge from the  terrestrial system and landless system and some of the people actually have not been within the  food system. So for some, it was quite a repetition. For others, it was all new, but I think it was very<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:22:59">0:22:59-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  important to get this vocabulary so we can also communicate and understand each other of what we  are talking about. But I think like everybody was super excited to just be finally together. And of  course, after a very long time of COVID and a lot of people being in isolation, but like just ideating<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:34</a>:</strong>  via Zoom. And even if you use like all of that wonderful technology as mirror or whatever, like,  it's never the same as feeling each other and being in the room and, you know, feeling the  vibrancy and the energy of each other and just like the passion and the motivation. So, I mean,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:34">0:23:34-0:23:54</a>:</strong>  for me personally, the program was quite emotional roller coaster as well. I mean, I'm so deeply,  you know, very passionate, but also very scared of where we are. And I'm really feeling that there's,  you know, now we are behind the steering wheel of this society, all of us that are alive on this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:23:54">0:23:54-0:24:08</a>:</strong>  planet. And there's a huge responsibility for us to do something. So of course, like there is so  much desire to understand the problem and do something about it. So it was really like from  week to week, it was like so many emotions happening. And the way the program was designed<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:08">0:24:08-0:24:27</a>:</strong>  is that you first committed to like digging into that problem for six weeks. And then the  next six weeks you were slowly supposed to be transitioned from a problem to a solution. So  we kind of divided each other into learning groups and me and another wonderful woman decided to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:44</a>:</strong>  look at the nutrient density, which is your favorite topic and our favorite topic as well.  So that was really wonderful to find another person that is also with the same mindset,  because the problems that people were working on were so diverse, you know, from fixing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:24:44">0:24:44-0:25:08</a>:</strong>  holistic raising problem to farmer transition to creating products from regenerative outputs to  nutrient density. It was really like we covered all of the supply chain and all of the problems  and solutions that you could think of. And then how did that deep dive into the problem side,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:08">0:25:08-0:25:25</a>:</strong>  which you knew obviously, how did that then transition into harvest care? Was it a very  natural one? Was it very uncomfortable? How did that process over in this case 12 weeks or six  weeks deep in the problem and then slowly transitioning to solution side? How did that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:25">0:25:25-0:25:44</a>:</strong>  happen? It wasn't definitely not a linear process. And I think nothing in the planet is linear, nor  hormonal cycles, nor the lunar cycle, nor the season cycle, nor the season cycle. So I think  we present for most like the biggest learning for me was to get away from thinking that any of this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:25:44">0:25:44-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  process will be linear and just accepting the constant flow. So the current problem with the  food system is that we are continuing to produce food as it would be so in 1950 and as would still  be scarce in countries. I think some people say that the food system is broken. I think that the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:32</a>:</strong>  food system runs just as it was designed, which is producing the most calories with the calories  that are the easiest to process, the easiest to transport, store with no environmental,  no human considerations, and also even economical considerations. Because in 1985,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:52</a>:</strong>  the Common Agriculture Policy, which was implemented by the European economical community,  was taking up 70% of the whole budget. So this system was never designed to really serve  anybody besides creating huge abundance of calories. Which it did, which it's doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:26:52">0:26:52-0:27:09</a>:</strong>  It was just continuing doing, totally. So you're saying the system is not broken. It works  perfectly the way we, the global we, designed it. But now it's time to redesign because we have  solved for the hunger side of things. For most cases, obviously there are huge distribution<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:09">0:27:09-0:27:27</a>:</strong>  issues, but in most cases we don't go to bed hungry, but we go to bed not, like male nutrition  or not fed. And that's a design question, or that's an incentive question, or that's a  conditioned question of this food system. And so what to do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:46</a>:</strong>  Exactly, exactly. As you said, our current problem is the nutritional insecurity. People have often  the access of calories, but they're missing essential nutrients as vitamins, minerals,  fatty acids, bi-active compounds, and so on, that are only present in our whole foods. And whole<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:27:46">0:27:46-0:28:07</a>:</strong>  foods by design should be harvested and consumed in a very short time, so they also have the highest  nutrient density. So most of the people right now in the Western Europe are dying from  lysate diseases, which is from diabetes to cancers to strokes to heart disease. And those diseases<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:07">0:28:07-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  are taking 86% of all of the deaths in Europe. 86, let's just think that in people listening.  86, that's an eight and then a six, which means almost all basically. We have 14% left for our  leftovers, but that's insane. And those numbers, they are not only human suffering behind,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:31">0:28:31-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  which I think for me at least is the most painful. But also that they are a huge burden of our  economies. They take 25% of the total healthcare spending in Europe and they are just being  expected to be on the rise, but they also create a huge loss of human power and human capital<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:28:53">0:28:53-0:29:13</a>:</strong>  because of these disabilities. And I think at least for me, we really need people healthy  and ready because we have real environmental challenges to fix. And we need to be people on  the point with their health. Both mentally and physically, we have a lot to do and we're not in<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:13">0:29:13-0:29:30</a>:</strong>  great shape. I think that's a conclusion there. We're not ready at all for this ecological  transition because yeah, we're not being fed or we're not feeding ourselves with the right kind  of nutrients, right kind of foods to even mentally have that be able to go through this and physically,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:30">0:29:30-0:29:44</a>:</strong>  let alone, I mean, we need to plant a lot of trees and we need to do a lot of work physically. And  yes, they're going to be augmented. We're going to have technology helping us for many things, but  let's not kid ourselves. This is not a laptop revolution. This is very, very different. So<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:29:44">0:29:44-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  we need to get in shape. Exactly. And it's very difficult to get in shape when the food we  consume, even if we consume whole foods, which we know it's really not the case for majority  of the population simply also because the organic or whole foods are so expensive and they are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:23</a>:</strong>  inaccessible for most of the society. But still within the conventional agricultural practices, we are  lowering the nutrient density, right? So the studies in the US show that on average, the nutritional  value we lost is around 38%. And those are big numbers and those are numbers from essential<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:23">0:30:23-0:30:43</a>:</strong>  nutrients, which are needed for healthy functioning of our body. And then beyond that, just to finish  it off with all the food is not only what this food is missing, but also what is present in our  food that we don't want those molecules to be present. And there was an annual report published<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:30:43">0:30:43-0:31:03</a>:</strong>  by the European Food Safety Authority in 2020, showing that at least half of the fruits and  vegetables in Europe consist of a pesticide residue. And out of this half, at least one-third  consists of a cocktail of up to 15 residues. And we have no idea what is happening in our body once.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:04">0:31:04-0:31:20</a>:</strong>  So many chemicals that should not supposed to be there are running from our bloodstream. And  so now I'm going to the transition because you asked me like, what was the transition?  Yeah, because this is very depressing. This sounds so big. Like, okay, we can see the problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:20">0:31:20-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  And now it's like, okay, what's the entry point? Because that of course, you are forced in a  venture studio to start thinking about venture. Like what's the, we can be an activist on this  side. We can do amazing scientific work, but that's not the role. I mean, you are an activist,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  but that's the role you chose, the role as an entrepreneur. So what's the entry point?  Yeah, exactly. So the entry point became an endocrine system for me.  So endocrine system is...<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  Explain.  Yes, let me explain. So the endocrine system is specifically threatened by all of the  pesticides residue as I just mentioned, because in those pesticides residue, there's something<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:16</a>:</strong>  called endocrine-disruptive chemicals. And those are chemicals which mimic or disrupts our hormones  in our body and they send like confusing messages and cause all kinds of dysfunctions.  So what is the endocrine system? Just very, very for everybody that English isn't their first<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:16">0:32:16-0:32:35</a>:</strong>  language. This is our hormonal system. Yes. So on the women's side, we're also men.  I mean, everybody has an endocrine system. Everybody is basically governed by our  ecosystem. I mean, we are governed by our biology and I think too often we are forgetting that we<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:35">0:32:35-0:32:51</a>:</strong>  are part of the nature. So both men and women have, you know, endocrine systems.  And we're getting like, we're being threatened or it's being exposed to so many toxins that  our hormones, which are completely governing our emotions, our health, et cetera, are getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:32:51">0:32:51-0:33:09</a>:</strong>  either confused or actually very badly, let's say, sending signals you don't want in your body.  Exactly. And as you said, they discover so much. They cover our mental health,  our reproductive health, our metabolism, our energy level, our microbiota, basically,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:09">0:33:09-0:33:25</a>:</strong>  whatever you think of us being performing, endocrine has an influence.  So our operating system is being hacked, basically. That's the, and not in a good way.  Not in a good way. And you were the one that you helped me also like go into this direction,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:25">0:33:25-0:33:45</a>:</strong>  because you have during the fresh program, you send me the white paper released by insurance  company saying that due to the low grade accumulation of toxicity, exposure in our food,  but not only in our cosmetics and plastic products, we have a huge infertility challenges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:33:45">0:33:45-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  And they're predicting that with the current decline in sperm activity, with next 35 years,  only 15 to 20% of the capas will be able to conceive naturally. Right. So in next 30 years,  basically our biology, just let us have that sink in for a second. People that's,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  I will put a paper below it's written by Jeremy Grant, very famous investor on the institutional  side, founder of GMO, which is funny because it's his name. It has nothing to do with GMO.  And they are a supporter of the podcast as well through their foundation. And he has been<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:37</a>:</strong>  hammering down this like the toxicity is a real, real threat. We don't know exactly where it comes  from. No, we know where it comes from. We don't know exactly what it does or how it works. We know  what it does because we see the outcome. And he said a famous sentence somewhere in that white<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:37">0:34:37-0:34:52</a>:</strong>  paper that he published or actually in his normal, like his normal, let's say, investors,  investor newsletter, where he was talking about, sperm count and toxicity, which I already find  hilarious that in like pension funds, et cetera, to get this white paper, they read it because it<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:34:52">0:34:52-0:35:06</a>:</strong>  is Jeremy Grant and they talk about sperm count, which is not the normal thing they discuss in  these boardrooms. But anyways, at the famous sentence, if you want to become, if you're  planning to, to have children over the next years and both men and women, and we'll come back to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:06">0:35:06-0:35:21</a>:</strong>  this piece, which is you just mentioned, have to eat. I have to avoid all toxicity possible,  which means eating organic, preferably beyond, but that's maybe too much to ask at the moment  where we get there. Like this toxicity is so threatening to us. Like we're, we're not<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:21">0:35:21-0:35:40</a>:</strong>  reproducing at the level we need for our pension system for all the work we need to do for like  couples are going through hell to, to get pregnant naturally. And you say that's just going down  further and which means very expensive programs, a lot of, a lot of pain, a lot of suffering or not<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:40">0:35:40-0:35:56</a>:</strong>  getting pregnant in a natural way, which sort of seems to be, should be a right for anybody if you  want that. But apparently we're losing that ability, which is very scary. So you thought,  okay, this is the entry point for where there is so much pain and where there is so much<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:35:56">0:35:56-0:36:12</a>:</strong>  possibility as well. Exactly. And just to, just to summarize this endocrine, I think what I, what I  spend a lot of time reflecting and I'm really fascinated about is that endocrine disruption  and climate change have a common origin, which is the fossil fuel consumption and production,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  because many of the pesticides include all kinds of chemicals as ethylene and propylene and methane,  which we have access thanks to the petroleum. So I think it's, it's like nature showing us  middle finger, right. In your face. You said you could burn this stuff. Could you like with that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:31">0:36:31-0:36:45</a>:</strong>  So we're running ourselves into the ground basically, literally like this is where,  where, I mean, you just have to look at the numbers. It's, it's really, really scary.  So what on the let's, let's show the path to solution. Like is this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:45">0:36:45-0:36:59</a>:</strong>  quote unquote, easily fixable? Like, are there examples studies? Like if you stop exposing  yourself as a couple, like what, what's that connection to, I mean, there's a very easy outcome,  do you get pregnant naturally or not? Like it's, it's sort of, that's, that's a, quite an easy test.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:36:59">0:36:59-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  Like what has been going on in that world? Have people been doing research, their experiments,  exposing people to let's say beyond organic or organic whole foods, et cetera?  Yeah. So I didn't look like my, my, I took the focus of endocrine, but not specifically on<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:35</a>:</strong>  fertility, but on woman endocrine system and look specific. I was focusing on polycystic  ovarian syndrome, which is the most prevalent endocrine disease among women. It's up to 20%  of us that are suffering from it. And the way it happens is basically your, your, your follicle cell<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:35">0:37:35-0:37:53</a>:</strong>  cannot mature. So instead of being released from your ovaries, it's transformed to cysts.  And then with time you accumulate more and more cysts and then they, they stop or like they're,  they hugely impact your hormone cycle. And there's a ton of research out there and a ton<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:37:53">0:37:53-0:38:17</a>:</strong>  of examples how you can manage this disease with lifestyle, which is, which includes healthy diet,  physical activity, preferably like hormonal yoga. So you also adapt your physical activity  to your predisposition from your mood and also stress management because elevated stress hormones<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:17">0:38:17-0:38:36</a>:</strong>  can also negatively influence this disease. And women are managing to heal themselves. I mean,  it's not a disease that you can just go on a treatment and then get better and then just quit.  That's not how it works. You just have to transform your life. And I think that's one of the challenge<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:36">0:38:36-0:38:59</a>:</strong>  of in general, it's just like, well, one of the challenge of using food as medicine is that we  are so used to being like very passive when it comes to our health. Our health and body literacy  and also food literacy are extremely low. And here we are talking about transforming your lifestyle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:38:59">0:38:59-0:39:14</a>:</strong>  So I think the reason why I love regenerative culture, because indeed, like it's so easy to  get caught up with all of the problems and how difficult the challenges are and complex. And the  more you understand them, the more you want to dig in. But the approach of regenerative culture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:14">0:39:14-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  which have the solutions of how to heal the food system always puts me back to like, okay,  like focus on what can we do right now. And there's few benefits from regenerative culture  in particular for using food as medicine and endocrine health. First is that if regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:49</a>:</strong>  culture is produced organically, then of course it won't have the endocrine disruptive chemicals,  which is very important. But additionally, and I don't want to go too much into it because you had  that core of the nutrient density before me here in David Montgomery and Anna Bigelow, which explained<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:39:49">0:39:49-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  beautifully and I don't want to even try to repeat anything. I will link it below, but I think it's  interesting. Like what does it add now? As we said, women are able to heal themselves with the  right type of yoga, meditation, stress release, eating well. They are okay. Like what does it<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:22</a>:</strong>  add now to go beyond and say, no, we're actually going to use regenerative practices to create  quote unquote, to grow food as medicine. Like what do you see there as the opportunity? Why  do you think that's an interesting path? So we need to heal ourselves and we need to heal<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:22">0:40:22-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  the planet at the same time. And regenerative agriculture allows us to do it because we know  that if we will not disturb the soil, we will plant the cover crops, we will have intensive  crop protections, we will have the positive effect on the soil microbiome. The positive effect on<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:58</a>:</strong>  soil microbiome will lead to higher nutrient density, which will allow us to access foods that  will heal us faster while healing the soil of Europe or the world or whatever. So this is why,  and now I will go to the Harvest Care, which is like the venture that came out from the fresh.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:00">0:41:00-0:41:16</a>:</strong>  The idea behind Harvest Care is to build an organization of a digital food pharmacy  that supports women and the crying disorders using meditative food, blended care approach  and community building. And then in later phase, I hope to also include food regenerative food<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:16">0:41:16-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  provisioning to help them to restore their hunger balance at the same time regenerative  the soil in Europe. And I know that there's lots to unpack there, but is it okay if I would just  take the time to please go? Yeah, please unpack. I'm unpacking that. Well then let's start from<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:52</a>:</strong>  the meditative food. Basically, meditative food is a diet that is prescribed for a specific disease,  for a specific person. And I think what's super important for me as a health professional is that  I see a lot of reductionist approach to looking at the diet. People may be filling out the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:41:52">0:41:52-0:42:11</a>:</strong>  questionnaire and saying like, okay, well, if you want to lose weight, you should be eating this.  But it's completely out of context. It doesn't take into account any kind of behavioral psychology,  how we work, what is the process behind forming a new habit. And I just don't believe that any kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:28</a>:</strong>  of software without the human touch will be able to facilitate this. So instead of creating just  easily scalable solution, what I really want to do is scale up the accessibility to help  professionals which use food as medicine. Because of the challenge, and this challenge comes from<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:28">0:42:28-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  my personal experience, that as nutritionist, I am not really part of the Western conventional  medicine and the healthcare. So I think first and foremost, creating a place where we can really  scale the accessibility and the easiness of accessing people who can help you with diet is<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:43:15</a>:</strong>  crucial and important. The reason why those diets should be super personalized is to not only help  the people understand of what they should be eating, but also guide them through all of the  process of gaining new knowledge, gaining new skills, changing how they relate to their self,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:15">0:43:15-0:43:34</a>:</strong>  how they relate to their body, to their food. And this I really believe is a people-in-people  approach. So that would be definitely one of the part of the solution. Then I decided to focus on  woman hormonal health. First and foremost, because I can and I think it's amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:36">0:43:36-0:43:54</a>:</strong>  Our cycles are really overlooked in the society. We live in a very linear society which  disregards all of the biological silos, including those running within our bodies. And I also,  I strongly believe that I'm committing to harvest care for many, many years ahead of me. So I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:43:54">0:43:54-0:44:14</a>:</strong>  having at least at the beginning, a very strong personal motivation to do it is also really  important. And then I mentioned blended care. So once I stopped heavily digging into agriculture  and the healthcare connection, I started looking at actually what is the best approach to form a<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:14">0:44:14-0:44:35</a>:</strong>  new health enhancing behaviors and what is the science behind there. And then this blended  care really emerged as something that is the future of the healthcare. So the blended care  takes one-on-one person visit, which can either be online or offline with a health professional.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:35">0:44:35-0:44:57</a>:</strong>  So in a harvest care example, it will be dietician or nutritionist. And then they use technology to  help you to nudge you to perform this. To actually do it. Yeah. To implement it, to not forget,  to build that habit change, which is so difficult. That's not like it's like changing habits is<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:44:57">0:44:57-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  insanely complicated and, but extremely important. So you do that mix of in-person either video or  in-person and then implementing that new habit of, or the new habits basically in trying to  deal with that syndrome. Exactly. And I think the human element is really there to,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  there are studies showing that if there is a health professional involved, like people motivation to  adhere to it, to a forming of a new behavior is higher, but then why not use technology,  which can help you on the moments that we cannot be together. And we are very lucky because we are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:38">0:45:38-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  rocketed in Rotterdam where there is the Erasmus Medical Center that is really pioneering the  blended care approach. And we are even looking at the possibility of testing our blended care  solutions to strengthen the validity behind it. And then another element that I really want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:46:12</a>:</strong>  work with is a community aspect. And I know that nowadays a lot of companies are throwing  communities, just I think to put a bit of a human perspective for the businesses.  But the reason why I believe, I strongly believe is that you need to build communities around<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:12">0:46:12-0:46:28</a>:</strong>  your new behavior. It's as you're transforming your life, you know, and you need people around.  We've learned that in addiction, like AA meetings are successful for many years because there's  community. And we have many, many examples of accountability showing up, being with other<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:28">0:46:28-0:46:44</a>:</strong>  people, going through similar things or a bit ahead or a bit behind. I mean, that's what we do.  And that's how we function. We are social animals. And with your new experiences,  you shift your priorities and you want to have people in your life where you'll be able to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:46:45">0:46:45-0:47:01</a>:</strong>  resonate and maintain those new, you know, you have new skill. Like suddenly fermenting became  a super important part of your diet. Like you want people around you, which also want to ferment,  then you want to have Friday fermentation days, you know, and we need to be able to ask questions<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:01">0:47:01-0:47:22</a>:</strong>  like, is this bubble normal or should it be smelling differently? Yeah, exactly. And it's just  yeah. So super important. And one of the way we want to test this is that we are going to hold  workshop about endocrine health for women with PCOS, the positive governance syndrome on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:22">0:47:22-0:47:42</a>:</strong>  And we want to see if them being exposed and like, you know, experiencing like what does health means  and where does health begins if it will have, you know, increasing their willingness to implement  those changes. Very interesting. Let's just repeat once the syndrome slowly. So everybody who's<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:42">0:47:42-0:47:58</a>:</strong>  writing can Google it as well. I put a link below definitely. But if you're currently thinking,  I just didn't catch it because it was too fast. Like what's the syndrome, but slowly.  It's called polycystic ovarian syndrome, PCOS. Okay. PCOS. So you can definitely find more. I'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:47:58">0:47:58-0:48:12</a>:</strong>  put a link below. And so where are you now? It's very early in the journey of the company. I had to  convince you to come on because you said it's early. I don't know yet. I said, yes, but I would  love to talk to you now and then talk to you again in a year, in two years and just keep following<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:12">0:48:12-0:48:30</a>:</strong>  this because that's what we do. So what's the current, we're talking the end of August, 2022,  we're at the end of summer in the Northern hemisphere, obviously. What would you say the  current status is or what do you, how would you describe Harvest Care as of this moment?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:32">0:48:32-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  You really had to convince me because I wasn't there. You have so many amazing participants that  have done so much. And then I come here with my dreams and hopes, but sometimes I will treat it  as a manifestation into the world. But so currently we are, so we have a community of two and a half<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:49:06</a>:</strong>  thousand people that are going to hold you accountable. You'll be good. I'm good. So we,  we, I mean, what was super cool with Fresh is that they are really helping me to, because I'm not a  person that, you know, if I would have to create a business as usual, I would never be doing it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:06">0:49:06-0:49:21</a>:</strong>  but they are really encouraging me to saying like, don't worry, we'll find a business model that will  serve the purpose and the mission that you want to accomplish. And something that is  crucially important for me, and this is long-term, is to also see how can I work with insurance<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:21">0:49:21-0:49:38</a>:</strong>  companies? Because I just, I can so easily see how regeneration and nutrient density can be easily  used as another lookship. So that's like, imagine that, you know, I test your microbiota and then I  say, okay, and now I will design a perfect nutrient density diet for, you know, to diversify your<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:38">0:49:38-0:49:57</a>:</strong>  microbes. And I just, I could not look into a mirror if I would go this path. For me, what's  really important is to see how can we serve those who are not served. And there is such a strong  economical, economical proofs and reasoning behind, you know, showing that prevention is<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:49:57">0:49:57-0:50:15</a>:</strong>  cheaper than intervention. And in the US, especially they have, and you also have the  founder of serious community where they manage to subsidize healthy food and teach kids how to  cook medically tailored diets. And so it's something super important, but of course this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:15">0:50:15-0:50:32</a>:</strong>  is long-term and you first need to prove your value or like the value of the model that you  design. So this is what we are doing right now. We want to take those elements that we found both  from like NGO awards and business awards and put them into our pack, our model and see what works<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:32">0:50:32-0:50:54</a>:</strong>  for dozens. So as I said, like the first phase is to invite women with PCOS on their own farm  experiences, workshop, but also cooking workshop with educational beds, sharing community creation,  basically what harvest care you want to do, but just on a tiny, tiny scale and see how are we<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:50:54">0:50:54-0:51:10</a>:</strong>  being able to deliver this value. Another track, which is super important for me is to also spread  the knowledge about general agriculture to other nutritionists. So we also want to invite  nutritionists and dietitianists on the farm to spread the information about the benefits of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:10">0:51:10-0:51:32</a>:</strong>  healthy soil for healthy humans. And then in phase two, it will be building a software of a digital  food pharmacy, which will connect and facilitate the relationship between people with diseases that  can be treated and managed through food as medicine. And I like to think about the behavior<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:32">0:51:32-0:51:51</a>:</strong>  change a bit of like learning a new language. So I would love this software be a place where you  don't only meet your dietician, but also the dietician or nutritionist can prescribe you like  a homework as watch this video of how to manage your glucose level while using indigenous grains,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:51:51">0:51:51-0:52:15</a>:</strong>  which are now cultivated by the regenerative local farmers. And then step three would be to  integrate this applications or this food prescriptions with vertical supply chain of  regenerative food. My spirit is very collaborative and I know that the solution will require<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:15">0:52:15-0:52:30</a>:</strong>  involvement of many people and I don't want to necessarily create a supply, you know,  regenerative supply chains. There are already amazing people working on it. It's all a question  like how can we match and mix together? And then once hopefully we'll manage to prove that the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:30">0:52:30-0:52:51</a>:</strong>  harvester is helping people, is helping farmers, then we'll have enough of evidence to go to  insurance companies and say, Hey, look, this will save you money and save people lives and will  transform people lives. So please help people to access food, which should be our basic human right<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:52:51">0:52:51-0:53:10</a>:</strong>  for those who cannot do it right now. So your strategy is really to prove this at a scale and  at a scalable way, let's say, and then go to the insurance companies to make sure it gets,  it becomes accessible also for those who cannot afford it on their own or don't even know it exists<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:10">0:53:10-0:53:28</a>:</strong>  or would never be exposed to it. If we don't act now, it might take 10, 20 years or whatever before  this knowledge is out there. And so what would you tell me? You're diving deep into this space of,  of nutrient density and the quality of food and the connection to reach an ag. And I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:28">0:53:28-0:53:44</a>:</strong>  investors are listening or people are listening. Like, what would you tell them after you're  emerging out of this, basically now a year later, eight or nine months later without giving  investment advice, obviously, but what would you tell investors to, to look into or to dig deeper<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:44">0:53:44-0:53:59</a>:</strong>  into in this, this quality piece of this quality space or the nutrient density space where,  where to look, where to, to dig deeper, where to ask more questions.  Yeah, I'm just a humble nutritionist now. So I'm like, I'm not sure if I am capable of<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:53:59">0:53:59-0:54:23</a>:</strong>  being a startup founder, but my perspective is very much like human and ecosystem wellbeing.  But definitely development of machinery that we can measure the nutrient density. And we know that  the bio nutrient association is already doing it, but having this as a, you know, investing more<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:23">0:54:23-0:54:42</a>:</strong>  money into this area where basically every consumer could be equipped with this kind of  little tool, that would be amazing. But also what kind of scares me a bit, maybe it's like how much  investment goes to this alternative protein. And now we know that like actually this alternative<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:54:42">0:54:42-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  meat production can influence our genome and it's quite tricky. So I would, if we really want to  change people's health and want to act fast, we need to invest much more money in humans,  just as harvest, as just as fresh date with us. Like we need to start running programs where we<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:02">0:55:02-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  increase people's food awareness, food literacy, health awareness. So, so rather of like maybe  investing so much money in like single product, which maybe is a great tool to gain money, like  no health comes from a single product. Just as health in ecosystem comes from diversity,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:22">0:55:22-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  it's the same as our health comes from the diversity. So investing in paradigm shift  and the mindset shift, I think, at least from my perspective, it's crucial.  So what would you do? I mean, this is a natural bridge to the 1 billion euro question. We love to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:58</a>:</strong>  ask if you're in charge of a billion euros, what would you, with a very long time horizon,  but it definitely should be put to work with the idea it comes back. What would you focus on?  So I strongly believe that there is way to high accumulation of human capital in cities,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:55:58">0:55:58-0:56:20</a>:</strong>  and that we need to start going away from centralized location and spreading this  human capital. So I would start investing in creating hubs, like social, food,  knowledge hubs around regenerated farms, where they create the possibility of young people,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:20">0:56:20-0:56:40</a>:</strong>  of young families, but also older generation to come in and start leading a drastically different  life. Life based on community, life based on localization. And with this kind of capital,  I think, like looking at the city, really the design cities in a way that they don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:56:40">0:56:40-0:57:00</a>:</strong>  benefit any of our physiological needs and they don't respect our physiological cycles. So  reshaping how we live and making regenerative farms as like the central hub of life and  creation of an ecosystem, human ecosystem. This is how I would spend this 1 billion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:01">0:57:01-0:57:17</a>:</strong>  Fascinating. And probably, I mean, this would go a very long way. I mean, you don't need  100 million per farm. Like you need way, way less and you can, it's a very interesting,  a whole different rabbit hole to go into the urban and rural divide and the future of that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:17">0:57:17-0:57:35</a>:</strong>  which sort of seems to be crumbling now with COVID, with remote working for many people as  possible, with the city has its advantages, but also lost a lot of the shiny stuff we used to see.  So let's see what's, I think it's going to be a very defining moment now that many people,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:35">0:57:35-0:57:51</a>:</strong>  not everyone or most people actually know, but a big chunk of people could practically work from  anywhere and maybe they do. And maybe they, hopefully they choose interesting places to be,  which in my case, obviously are our regenerative farms and they will bring an energy. They will<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:57:51">0:57:51-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  bring some finance as well. They will bring questions, but also interesting answers to  these places that often have been depopulated over the last decades or last few hundred years  while we all move to the big shiny city. So that's a very interesting, we're going to see<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:29</a>:</strong>  how that plays out. And if you could change one thing overnight in the food and agriculture  system, what would that be if you had a magic wand? So with my magic wand, I would  design the food system in a way that always prioritize human health throughout all of the,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:29">0:58:29-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  all of the processes from the production to harvesting, to storage, to processing,  because if we would really focus on what is needed for our health, we would get rid of most  of our problems. We would get rid of monocultures, we would get rid of agrochemicals, we would get<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:59:03</a>:</strong>  rid of junk food and would just have completely different experience on this planet as humans.  And also would allow for nature to have a different experience with us being on this planet  with her.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/zuzanna-zielinska#t=0:59:05">0:59:05-0:59:20</a>:</strong>  I think it's a perfect way to end this conversation. I couldn't agree more. And I want  to thank you so much for coming on. It wasn't easy. I mean, I know you wanted to be further  along, but I think it's really good to check in now and follow this over time as we love to do<br />
