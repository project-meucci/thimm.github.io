<p><strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:14</a>:</strong>  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:00:14">0:00:14-0:00:22</a>:</strong>  Getting sick of the carbon hype?  Get ready for the biodiversity one.  But first we have to figure out how to measure it and what a biodiversity gain actually means.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:00:22">0:00:22-0:00:36</a>:</strong>  The current status quo is sending a team of ecologists to survey, meaning listening, looking,  etc. at plants, insects and birds and make a report.  That is, as you can imagine, extremely expensive and only mining companies can afford it, also<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:00:36">0:00:36-0:00:49</a>:</strong>  because they are forced to do so by law.  So what role can technology play here?  How do we bring down the costs of these surveys by 100x?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:00:49">0:00:49-0:00:59</a>:</strong>  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast.  Investing as if the planet mattered.  Where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space to learn more on<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:00:59">0:00:59-0:01:10</a>:</strong>  how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities and ecosystems  while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:01:10">0:01:10-0:01:22</a>:</strong>  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small, and consumers start paying much more<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:01:22">0:01:22-0:01:32</a>:</strong>  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.

<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:01:54">0:01:54-0:02:00</a>:</strong>  Today we go deep into measuring biodiversity with Cameron Frayling, the co-founder of Pivotal  Earth.  Welcome Cameron.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:02:00">0:02:00-0:02:09</a>:</strong>  Hello, nice to be here.  And I mean, biodiversity is a buzzword, luckily now, or it's becoming a buzzword in our little  bubble.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:02:09">0:02:09-0:02:21</a>:</strong>  But let's unpack a bit how you, because you're not a biodiversity ecologist that has traveled  the world and went deep into the Congolese forest to, I don't know, to measure butterflies  or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:02:21">0:02:21-0:02:32</a>:</strong>  So how did you end up focusing on this fascinating, but probably relatively new, at least professionally  for you, world of biodiversity?  What led you to this fascinating path you're on now?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:02:32">0:02:32-0:02:44</a>:</strong>  Sure, well, my background has actually been in creating life science companies.  I created a few companies in Cambridge in the UK.  They've all been focused on genetics, cancer diagnostics, therapeutic development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:02:44">0:02:44-0:02:54</a>:</strong>  And I really enjoy bringing together very smart people from very different backgrounds  to solve difficult problems.  And along the way, you usually invent a few things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:02:54">0:02:54-0:03:08</a>:</strong>  Over the long term, I mean, life science can be incredibly impactful for humans.  And what I found, though, was I was very hungry to create more of a direct positive impact  on the nature that I saw around me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:03:08">0:03:08-0:03:16</a>:</strong>  Many people obviously enjoy spending time in nature.  But my wife is actually a PhD ecologist who has carried out biodiversity surveys all over  the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:03:16">0:03:16-0:03:27</a>:</strong>  And over the years, I've been able to hear in depth some of the problems with biodiversity  surveys, mostly how painstakingly manual they are, and the lack of real investment  in space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:03:27">0:03:27-0:03:32</a>:</strong>  But also the issues...  Did you ever join her?  Like, did you get exposed to this nature?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:03:32">0:03:32-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  Is that even a thing?  Like, can you come along as the plus one in that case?  And do you get exposed to the crazy jungles or the crazy places she must have been?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:49</a>:</strong>  Or you heard the stories back when she was back home, basically?  So I would get to hear when she came home.  That's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:03:49">0:03:49-0:03:58</a>:</strong>  So I mean, like some of them she went, like, for example, she went on one for a month in  Liberia.  And she was there with like 15 ecologists, there were two guards, there was a medic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:03:58">0:03:58-0:04:07</a>:</strong>  When they stay at night, it's at a camp, it's got fencing, it's controlled.  Yeah, there's no way a plus one would have been welcome.  So I would have loved to have seen it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:22</a>:</strong>  And now we're doing them together.  And so then that's how these biodiversity surveys are done.  Large teams on the ground, and manually ticking boxes, counting, listening to things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:04:22">0:04:22-0:04:34</a>:</strong>  That's what I imagine.  And I mean, we can all imagine the time it takes and the costs, which means it's only  being done by very, very few, in very, very few places and very few organizations that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:04:34">0:04:34-0:04:41</a>:</strong>  have those budgets or are forced to have those budgets.  Yeah, I mean, it's incredibly expensive.  This is one of the things that blew my mind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:04:41">0:04:41-0:04:50</a>:</strong>  And that I've got to hear about over the years is just how expensive it is.  That one survey that she did, the cost of that team that she led was half a million  dollars.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:04:50">0:04:50-0:04:58</a>:</strong>  But there were three teams, and they went back twice, one for the wet season, one for  the dry season.  Who on earth could possibly afford that level of survey?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:04:58">0:04:58-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  Only companies that are required to do it, and only for the most profitable projects.  And I guess it's for this reason that if you look at compliance with biodiversity offsetting  regulation, compliance is 20%, even though it's actually law in 42 countries for highly<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  destructive industries.  So it's really, it's law in many places.  We have to do this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:05:19">0:05:19-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  We don't because it's simply unprofitable.  You cannot even put it in a budget of if you're running a large scale plantation.  The only thing that can afford that are the extremely extractive mining industry that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:45</a>:</strong>  makes enough money and that has somewhere in their budgeting plans, which means like,  do you have any clue how much like globally, like, how many of these biodiversity surveys  are done?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:05:45">0:05:45-0:05:49</a>:</strong>  Like, how much do we know actually of biodiversity?  Is there, is it like 0.01%?  Is it one?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:05:49">0:05:49-0:05:59</a>:</strong>  No, probably that sounds a bit too much.  Like how much, how good of an eye do we have or an understanding do we have of our state  of global biodiversity if we don't do these surveys?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:05:59">0:05:59-0:06:09</a>:</strong>  Let me answer the first question is how many of these surveys have actually done.  So if you look at like the Polson report, which I can forward to you after this, I mean,  it's very good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:06:09">0:06:09-0:06:19</a>:</strong>  It's slightly out of date now, a couple of years out of date, but it went through and  tried to put some kind of number on how much is actually spent by these companies on biodiversity  offsets in the regulated market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:06:19">0:06:19-0:06:29</a>:</strong>  And it's about 9 billion per year, which is way more than people expect.  Most people have never heard of a biodiversity offset.  But the thing is, is that there's a reason for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:06:29">0:06:29-0:06:41</a>:</strong>  Obviously they're done with shell companies, they're done with NDAs.  And also they're incredibly flawed.  They are not at all linked to actual outcomes for nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:53</a>:</strong>  They enable offsets to be created, which are not based on real outcomes.  And this is one of the real things that we are trying to solve.  And so when you're saying they're flawed, they're not connected to real outcomes, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:06:53">0:06:53-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  means a company is paying, a company is paying surveying or that credit has to be created,  but it doesn't have a real connection to something that improved in biodiversity, obviously,  on the ground or in the sea or wherever it's created.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:17</a>:</strong>  That's sort of 9 billion is being pumped around basically in a sector, which is still quite  a lot.  And maybe some of that does something positive, but it's nowhere near what we need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:07:17">0:07:17-0:07:25</a>:</strong>  And even at 9 billion, you're saying it's not being used effectively or put to work  effectively because it could be quite a big impact.  9 billion is a lot of money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:07:25">0:07:25-0:07:32</a>:</strong>  It is.  So what I would say is that the way the offsets have been constructed historically is deeply  flawed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:07:32">0:07:32-0:07:45</a>:</strong>  I can give you an example.  But also, I think the time is long past.  We need to be looking at creating significant gains, regenerating the land, regenerating<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:07:45">0:07:45-0:07:58</a>:</strong>  nature and I think simply offsetting destruction is nowhere near enough.  Let me give you an example of an offset that is public and therefore I can talk about it.  So it's actually an example of a good case.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:07:58">0:07:58-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  There are far, far worse cases than this.  Some of them are absolutely appalling.  But this is a good one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:13</a>:</strong>  This is Rio Tinto.  And basically, they wanted to take a mine in Mongolia.  And so they did a biodiversity survey and they said, look, what biodiversity is there<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:08:13">0:08:13-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  on the ground?  We need to comply with regulation.  Any nature that we destroy, we're going to have to offset.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:08:19">0:08:19-0:08:29</a>:</strong>  So they did the survey, they got a sense of what was there and they said, okay, great,  now we know.  Right, find us an ecosystem which is similar, a similar habitat, and then find somewhere<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:08:29">0:08:29-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  where we can restore biodiversity and therefore offset any destruction that we cause.  And so a team went out and they found an area which was 50,000 square kilometers.  And they said, okay, if we take down fencing in this area, and we reduce hunting, we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:55</a>:</strong>  increase the species and abundance of the species, we can improve migration, biodiversity  should improve.  And so Rio Tinto said, great, okay, what we'll do is create a trust in Mongolia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:08:55">0:08:55-0:09:06</a>:</strong>  And we'll put 25 years of funding into this trust, which is what they're required to show  to comply with the regulation.  And then biodiversity will increase and then off we go and dig our mine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:09:06">0:09:06-0:09:12</a>:</strong>  And so they did this, they put $70 million into a trust in Mongolia.  Seven zero.  Seven zero.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:09:12">0:09:12-0:09:16</a>:</strong>  And there's a team of people-  It's not one seven, it's seven zero.  That's our money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:09:16">0:09:16-0:09:22</a>:</strong>  Seven zero.  Yeah.  And then this is to fund these actions of removing fencing, trying to reduce hunting<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:09:22">0:09:22-0:09:30</a>:</strong>  in the region.  In the meantime, they go and start digging their mine.  Now the issue is that let's imagine those people in Mongolia are absolutely the best<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:09:30">0:09:30-0:09:38</a>:</strong>  in the world.  There is no guarantee they're actually going to increase biodiversity in this area.  And yet the mine has started to be dug.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:09:38">0:09:38-0:09:49</a>:</strong>  And this is one example of how there's a huge disconnect between the destruction that takes  place and the actual increases that are created.  So there's no guarantee.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:09:49">0:09:49-0:10:01</a>:</strong>  There's no real link to gains that are made.  And I guess this is what we're trying to do is enable people to invest in actual measured  outcomes, not in hopes or aspirations or simply putting money into a trust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:10:01">0:10:01-0:10:09</a>:</strong>  And that would really change, I think, what happens on the ground.  So that's the issue at the moment.  We put 70 million in, which is a lot of money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:10:09">0:10:09-0:10:26</a>:</strong>  But then there's no connection to I mean, if we at the end said, oh, we spend it all  in in 25 years or even less on removing fences, but nothing really happened because it didn't  reduce hunting or maybe it increased hunting or we did grazing differently or what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:10:26">0:10:26-0:10:30</a>:</strong>  Like there's no there are no KPIs.  There's no measurement.  It's just OK.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:10:30">0:10:30-0:10:39</a>:</strong>  We imagine it would cost or legally we have to put 70 million.  That's sort of a rounding error in our budget anyway, of this mine, which is a few billion.  And let's put it in this trust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:10:39">0:10:39-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  We tick the box of our biodiversity plan.  And if there's anything happening on the ground or not, or this money flows to whatever trust  outside or is being eaten or because people went to to to gamble on it or whatever this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:11:02</a>:</strong>  this money done, we will never know.  And maybe there will be a scandal at some point, but it will never come back to Rio  Tinto because they did their work and they did actually their work because there's no<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:11:02">0:11:02-0:11:09</a>:</strong>  outcome.  There's no outcome piece, which sounds exactly the same as we're struggling with in carbon  and soil carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:11:09">0:11:09-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  And we are regenerative or we're not unless it's connected to an outcome.  It is very, very, very shaky, let's say.  So how how would you change that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:26</a>:</strong>  And then let's get to why outcome.  I mean, we talked about it a bit, but why measuring the outcomes is so difficult until  now or was so difficult until now?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:11:26">0:11:26-0:11:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  So I think this is the problem to solve this number one.  You have to be able to reduce the cost of the monitoring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:11:33">0:11:33-0:11:41</a>:</strong>  Otherwise, there's no way that you can measure the outcome and improve it because most of  the money goes to measure it.  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:54</a>:</strong>  It has to cost less than any revenue that you might gain or financial gains that you  might get from from improving an outcome, providing an outcome for nature.  And so the first thing is, can you bring down like 100 X less or something like that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:11:54">0:11:54-0:12:03</a>:</strong>  What are we what are we talking about?  If you in your in your mind or in your goal and your business plan, what are we we're  not talking 10 X less or a few percent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:12:03">0:12:03-0:12:12</a>:</strong>  This is like significantly less to enable much more, much more measurement and repeatedly  and et cetera.  So what are you hoping for?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:12:12">0:12:12-0:12:20</a>:</strong>  What are you targeting?  Yeah.  Well, so I guess let's just go through why we think it's actually possible to do this<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:12:20">0:12:20-0:12:30</a>:</strong>  now.  So the first point is that you've got amazing off the shelf sensors these days.  They can do really incredible imaging, acoustics, you name it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  But also there's autonomous navigation of drones, which can collect data at scale in  ways that just haven't really been possible.  And then there's machine learning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:49</a>:</strong>  And so when it comes to data collection, the first part is, well, we can't have 15 people  walking through a forest or walking through a landscape.  That's just way too expensive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:12:49">0:12:49-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  It doesn't scale.  I mean, are there enough ecologists out there to handle the demand for what, you know, for  for all the sites that are that are in the world?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  I would say almost certainly no, it's not a model at scale.  And certainly it's very expensive.  So instead of 15 people, can we have one person deploying lots of sensors, technology, flying<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  drones, these sorts of things?  And the answer to that is, well, yes, you can have one person collecting data on something  like even now with our first pilots, something like 100 hectares per day per person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:32</a>:</strong>  And then all of that data is uploaded into the cloud, where we can then analyse it with,  you know, data pipelines, it's passed through machine learning.  And then the really critical thing is that it's quality controlled by ecologists who<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:13:32">0:13:32-0:13:45</a>:</strong>  are actually expert in that particular habitat.  And what they're helping with is quality control, but also annotation, identification of species.  There are not databases that we can just tap into for every area of the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:13:45">0:13:45-0:13:56</a>:</strong>  And so we're creating some of these ourselves, that's going to be a substantial amount of  work and substantial amount of money.  But in the end, once we have looked at one habitat and identified a first set of species,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:13:56">0:13:56-0:14:12</a>:</strong>  if we go back, we're going to have, you know, a much easier time, the second time it'll  be faster, be less expensive, and it scales.  And so then you have a way of collecting data, which works on sort of medium scales, hundreds<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:14:12">0:14:12-0:14:23</a>:</strong>  to thousands of hectares.  And then you've got a method of analysing the data, which definitely scales.  What we need to move to, to bring down the cost even more, is enable third parties to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:14:23">0:14:23-0:14:37</a>:</strong>  actually collect the data for us, for us to help with quality controlling where they go,  you know, helping create a plan, place the sensors here, here and here, fly the drones  here, here and here, have minimum requirements for the quality of the data, be able to quality<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:14:37">0:14:37-0:14:52</a>:</strong>  control that in evidence that they were actually where, you know, we said they were.  Because ultimately, what we want to do is be able to warrant to companies and to investors  that the gains that we see are real and exist.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:14:52">0:14:52-0:15:06</a>:</strong>  I think it's a fascinating, I mean, lots to unpack there.  But one thing you mentioned, it's getting like there's a path to getting even cheaper,  or there's a path to learning and we're creating some of these, these databases ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:15:06">0:15:06-0:15:14</a>:</strong>  And of course, if you have to send out a manual or personal team of 15 people, that's only  going to get more expensive over time.  Like flights are getting more expensive, everything gets more expensive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:15:14">0:15:14-0:15:26</a>:</strong>  And these ecologists, if they're getting, if there's more demand, obviously, they should  and they will charge more.  In this case, there's a very clear path like you do certain projects in Southern France.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:15:26">0:15:26-0:15:36</a>:</strong>  And after a while, of course, if you go back to the same site, it becomes a lot faster  and thus cheaper because you already surveyed a lot of the species, even if there was no  database, you sort of created one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:15:36">0:15:36-0:15:47</a>:</strong>  But if you go to the neighboring ones, if you go to a similar side, I mean, the learnings  are there because it's stored in the cloud, it's stored in a, and the software can start  to take over certain things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:15:47">0:15:47-0:15:58</a>:</strong>  Doesn't mean it takes over everything, of course, there's ecologists that has to make  the first time, but at least it makes it scalable.  And so very practically on the ground, you mentioned first pilots, how does it, how does<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:15:58">0:15:58-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  a first pilot look like?  In this case, it's you, I know that.  But how should we imagine it's a field, it's a farm, it's a forest?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:13</a>:</strong>  What have some of these, of course, without revealing too much, but some of these first  pilots look like if we should think, okay, you said, there are amazing sensors around,  okay, how big are they?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:16:13">0:16:13-0:16:23</a>:</strong>  Are they small?  Or how should we bring us visually to one of these pilots and how it works?  So the first pilot we did was actually in April.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:16:23">0:16:23-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  So we're still a very young company, we only kicked off, you know, following a pre-seed  round late October last year.  So we've got off the ground pretty quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  And the first staff that have joined, actually, the first one was a PhD ecologist, sorry,  PhD mathematician.  And she is absolutely amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:49</a>:</strong>  And her focus is on looking at indices of biodiversity, what they mean, what they don't  mean.  And that was actually her postdoc work as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:16:49">0:16:49-0:16:55</a>:</strong>  And then there's an assistant professor of machine learning who's joined us.  And then there's also-  Just on indices, what do you mean by that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:16:55">0:16:55-0:17:06</a>:</strong>  Because we talked about it in a pre-interview and it's fascinating, like what, because when  you start measuring or start identifying things like, oh, I saw this grass species and this  insect, like not everything is as important as like, you can get overwhelmed by the amount<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:17:06">0:17:06-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  of data.  So why is the first one you hired on math, basically, just to figure out what should  we pay attention to or how does that work in biodiversity?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:26</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  So let's come back to that because that is a huge question.  So the first thing is with those people, we started putting together the plan of how are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:17:26">0:17:26-0:17:41</a>:</strong>  we actually going to survey our pilot.  And so it was 177 hectares with this wonderful, wonderful couple who owned this 400 hectares  in Portugal, very kindly allowed us to come and measure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:17:41">0:17:41-0:17:56</a>:</strong>  They have been working on improving biodiversity for, I think, at least 15 years.  They had a survey done by a university probably a decade ago and they shared some of the results  of that, the habitat classifications and things like this, and very generous in letting us<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:17:56">0:17:56-0:18:06</a>:</strong>  come and measure the site.  And the first thing we did was fly drones, you know, something like 100 meters above  the ground, very standard to create a habitat map.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:18:06">0:18:06-0:18:16</a>:</strong>  It gives us very good resolution for very little money.  We have a two centimeter resolution map.  And with that, we can then feed it to machine learning, which then simply categorizes the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:18:16">0:18:16-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  different kinds of habitats.  So you've got 177 hectares, you're going to have a bunch of different types of habitats  there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  We don't need to classify them with machine learning.  We can pass that to a Portuguese ecologist that we're working with who can very quickly  say, OK, da da da da da da, done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:43</a>:</strong>  And then that's a great start.  So and it's really important to have these habitat classifications as well because they're  going to link to credits in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:18:43">0:18:43-0:19:01</a>:</strong>  So then the other thing we did was place on this 177 hectares, 30 different acoustic sensors.  So we used ones with a really high frequency band.  They go up to 384 kilohertz, which means that we can sample birds, bats, insects, mammals,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:19:01">0:19:01-0:19:07</a>:</strong>  amphibians.  And we recorded all of these things.  I've got lovely recordings of birds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:19:07">0:19:07-0:19:20</a>:</strong>  Actually through almost the entire 24 hours, you can hear things.  We've got owls in the middle of the night, crickets chirped all night, amphibians, frogs,  they were going crazy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:31</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of life on this farm.  And we did them in two different ways.  We did them as a race, which helps us look at the distance between a sound that we hear.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:19:31">0:19:31-0:19:38</a>:</strong>  And that helps us with abundance calculations.  And then we also had point sensors.  So we had these 30 sensors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:19:38">0:19:38-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  And then we also had really low level drone flights.  By low level, I mean two meters above the ground going 1.5 meters per second and then  looking at different angles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:52</a>:</strong>  So the first one was actually based on an idea.  You were flying this, right?  Just for drone people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:19:52">0:19:52-0:20:00</a>:</strong>  This is low.  And I don't know if you were using, what is it, first person view.  That's really easy to crash into stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:00">0:20:00-0:20:08</a>:</strong>  But it's meant to be low because it's sort of the height of an ecologist walking through  the field.  I mean, depending on the height of the person, if you're from the Nordics, maybe it's even<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:08">0:20:08-0:20:13</a>:</strong>  a bit higher.  But it's more or less the height of the eyes.  But it's not easy to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:13">0:20:13-0:20:21</a>:</strong>  But it's also not super difficult, I think.  I mean, the bad thing is in the forest, it's tricky.  But in most places, you have to pay attention and you should use a super expensive drone<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:21">0:20:21-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  probably.  Yeah, that's exactly right.  So it is meant to mimic a person walking through that habitat and what they would actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:32</a>:</strong>  see.  And I have to say, it works really well.  Works really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:32">0:20:32-0:20:42</a>:</strong>  We've been feeding it to a botanist, a Portuguese botanist.  And he is able to identify basically everything.  There's sort of six species that he wasn't able to identify just with the imaging that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:42">0:20:42-0:20:51</a>:</strong>  we took.  And then we also have cameras facing straight down.  And that allows us to do a percent cover of different species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:51">0:20:51-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  So it's proved really, really effective.  And that gives us a lot.  This point is so interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:21:02</a>:</strong>  You send it to a Portuguese botanist that obviously didn't have to travel to visit the  site.  Could be in his or her office somewhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:21:02">0:21:02-0:21:14</a>:</strong>  Could be not in Portugal at all.  Could be the expert on this stuff that lives, I don't know, northern Norway.  And he or she is able to do it from his or her office, laptop, computer, et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:21:14">0:21:14-0:21:24</a>:</strong>  And not once, but because the data can be used again to do the next one in Portugal  or the next one nearby, et cetera, et cetera.  So there's that learning curve that should make it exponentially cheaper over time, just<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:21:24">0:21:24-0:21:34</a>:</strong>  like every deployment of solar makes it cheaper over time, just like technology does.  And in good and bad.  And at the same time, easily a team of 15 botanists that have to walk that field are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:21:34">0:21:34-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  not getting exponentially cheaper over time.  That's exactly right.  He's actually, yeah, he's in Madrid.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  And who cares?  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:21:42">0:21:42-0:21:45</a>:</strong>  There's internet.  So what's the other point?  So he identified it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:21:45">0:21:45-0:21:57</a>:</strong>  Probably he would have preferred to be on the field, I can imagine.  So there's a small tension there, but it's definitely not scalable if he had to travel  from Madrid to Portugal to that farm to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:21:57">0:21:57-0:22:03</a>:</strong>  I mean, it becomes, yeah, you can do the cost calculations.  So you look forward and down.  Sorry, go ahead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:22:03">0:22:03-0:22:09</a>:</strong>  One thing that's been really amazing is the response from ecologists that we've been contacting  to help us identify these things.  Do they feel threatened?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:22:09">0:22:09-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  Not at all.  They're overjoyed.  The consistent message that we get from these ecologists is that they're often very tired<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  of being used to look at projects where all they're really measuring is loss.  And so the idea of going out there and helping us measure gain is sort of a dream come true.  And yeah, for sure, they'd love to be in the field, but there's going to be plenty of<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:22:31">0:22:31-0:22:38</a>:</strong>  chance for that.  And all we're doing is increasing the scale of the impact that they can have.  There's going to be a lot more fields to visit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:22:38">0:22:38-0:22:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's for sure.  There's going to be a lot more interesting ones, not just a mine site that then you know  whatever you're surveying there in a year is going to be basically a big pit with a<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:22:47">0:22:47-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  huge hole in it.  And yeah, that must be quite depressing, actually.  I never thought about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:23:02</a>:</strong>  Okay.  So you're collecting all this visual data, the acoustic data, you're feeding it between  brackets to the experts to identify certain things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:23:02">0:23:02-0:23:10</a>:</strong>  And then what happens?  Or that was basically the pilot until now?  Or what what has given that data or that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:23:10">0:23:10-0:23:17</a>:</strong>  What what what came out of that for you?  What were surprises interests also for for a couple of years later was that is living  on the farm?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:23:17">0:23:17-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  Well, one surprise was we identified lots of different birds, some of which are really  not meant to be there.  And so it's interesting to see that we're now trying to check by whom like sorry, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:35</a>:</strong>  why are they not meant to be there?  If they want to be there, it can be there.  Like you were doubting like, oh, this thing has been extinct in Numbria, a peninsula or<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:23:35">0:23:35-0:23:44</a>:</strong>  because they should be in the nature area.  One of them is actually an owl that's endemic to Cyprus.  And yet somehow, we seem to have picked it up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:23:44">0:23:44-0:23:51</a>:</strong>  So we're making sure this is true.  So there's a lot of sort of quality control that needs to go in.  Certainly, at these early stages, we're going to pick up lots of things that are not real.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:23:51">0:23:51-0:23:59</a>:</strong>  But that's what that's what quality control is for.  And that's why we're working hand in hand with these ornithologists in this case.  And they're amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:23:59">0:23:59-0:24:11</a>:</strong>  I mean, my God, they can identify pretty much everything just by by ear.  The skill levels these people have is just staggering.  They're hearing and eyesight for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:24:11">0:24:11-0:24:22</a>:</strong>  And you're identifying grasses, etc.  I had to laugh because it reminds me I put the link in the show notes of an interview  I did with Isabella Tree on rewilding and wilding their their farm or their estate in<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:24:22">0:24:22-0:24:29</a>:</strong>  NEP.  And they had nightingales coming back and everybody was arguing they weren't supposed  to be there because they're forest birds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:24:29">0:24:29-0:24:37</a>:</strong>  And they don't have a forest, they have an open savanna.  And like slowly, the scientific community came around and said, Yeah, maybe they are  actually open savanna birds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:24:37">0:24:37-0:24:47</a>:</strong>  And we pushed them all the way into the forest and they are barely hanging in there.  And now they got their their natural habitat back.  And of course, they flock to to that estate where they have more pairs than in some neighboring<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:24:47">0:24:47-0:24:54</a>:</strong>  neighboring nature state that should be all about nature.  So they're not supposed to be there, but they're there.  So let's how do we cope with that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:24:54">0:24:54-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  Or how you're going to probably find a lot of these things, which are going to be very,  very interesting, disturbing.  More of them are going to be small errors in your in your data, but many of them are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  going to be sort of small errors in the in the scientific data set that has to be adjusted.  I think that's right.  I mean, so the the ranges for these species, they're trapped by lots of different groups.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  And they're also going to change over time.  So sometimes the resolution of the information we have is relatively poor.  So there are this work that's done by the UN, for example, the UNWCMC, who do incredible<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  things with with biodiversity data.  And the resolution of the maps they produce is often sort of the 10 kilometer by 10 kilometer  pixel size.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:25:39">0:25:39-0:25:50</a>:</strong>  And so I mean, a lot, a lot that could happen in that sort of where you only have that kind  of resolution.  But also things could change as with with, you know, warming planet and habitats will<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:25:50">0:25:50-0:26:01</a>:</strong>  change, things will migrate.  And so what are your lessons learned of this this first pilot?  It sounds like quite quite a bit worked, which is amazing for a first pilot, like in terms<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:26:01">0:26:01-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  of like, what are next steps now?  Are you going to repeat them different environments different?  What does the roadmap is not is maybe not the right word, but what what are the next<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:19</a>:</strong>  steps after this pilot?  You're going to buy a better drone or different a lot more server space or what's what's what's  happening?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:26:19">0:26:19-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  So in terms of things we learned, we did manage to collect all the data that we that we intended  to which was, you know, a small miracle is amazing.  I had a serious encounter with a barbed wire fence, I managed to end up with like cuts<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:41</a>:</strong>  on my face.  And the sad thing is, I still don't have any kind of sexy scar.  I was really hoping for something because you were flying the drone, you walked into<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:26:41">0:26:41-0:26:50</a>:</strong>  it or what?  No, I actually just a piece of wood collapse that I fell onto my forearm.  And then I had a backpack on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:26:50">0:26:50-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  So it pushed me down.  I fell on my face.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:26:57</a>:</strong>  Anyway, I'm fine.  So no, we learned a lot.  We learned a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:26:57">0:26:57-0:27:08</a>:</strong>  The the data analysis is, you know, it's a moving feast.  So it's still ongoing.  But what we're doing is now turning this into a bunch of different indices.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:27:08">0:27:08-0:27:16</a>:</strong>  You asked about what are these indices?  Yeah, that's like that piece of it.  Why is that important to to figure out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:27:16">0:27:16-0:27:26</a>:</strong>  Okay, with all the things we see and hear, let's now bring it back to something that  we can track over time, or that makes sense to track, how do we pick what makes sense  to track?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:27:26">0:27:26-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  Is it this insect group?  An insect group?  Is it this plant?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  Is it that noise?  Like, what do we focus on in all this noise between brackets?  What do we how do we focus on the important, important sounds?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.  So I think the way to look at this is, in some ways, it's a few things.  And then it's also how do you create a credit?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:59</a>:</strong>  Because I think that answers to some degree, you know, some of these things.  So if we just think first of how do you actually tackle creating a credit from these indices  of biodiversity, and the data that comes out of it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:27:59">0:27:59-0:28:11</a>:</strong>  And then again, hopefully, again, not always a game, hopefully, again, you know, if it's  gonna be real, sometimes it's gonna go down, and we have to expect that to be true.  So I think the first thing is you have to choose the right people to work on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:28:11">0:28:11-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  And so I mean, my my co founder, Zoe, and so she has more than 20 years, you know, working  with a wide variety of stakeholders on the ground, you know, at a policy level.  I mean, she was a British diplomat, she was negotiating policy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  But she's also carried out biodiversity service on the ground, it gives her a rare set of  experiences and worldview.  And I think, you know, I think that the other person that is really critical to constructing<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:56</a>:</strong>  a biodiversity credit in a sensible way, is a mathematician.  And so there was a paper that we, we read that we really loved.  And it was all about biodiversity indices, what they mean, and what they don't mean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:28:56">0:28:56-0:29:05</a>:</strong>  And I'm happy to send this to you afterwards.  Basically, we reached out to the first author, and we loved her, she was great.  And in the end, she joined.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:29:05">0:29:05-0:29:19</a>:</strong>  And she and Zoe are now, you know, spearheading how you construct this credit.  She's very much in charge of which indices we use and why.  And right now, we're actually writing a pretty lengthy white paper on, you know, why we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:29:19">0:29:19-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  doing what we're doing, how you think about these things.  But it's not just, I mean, the math has to make sense.  It has to make sense for people on the ground, you know, from a biodiversity point of view,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  from an ecologist point of view.  And so I think, firstly, you've got a mathematician and ecologist helping construct this.  But then we also needed to work for the people who are actually going to be trading any kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:46</a>:</strong>  of value.  And so we need to speak with traders.  And that's what we've been doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:29:46">0:29:46-0:29:53</a>:</strong>  You know, people who would purchase, sell, trade a credit, and we need to understand  their needs.  We also need to talk to companies, understand what they need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:29:53">0:29:53-0:30:01</a>:</strong>  And we also need to speak to farmers and foresters and people doing rewilding, understand what  they need.  I think the other thing is that...<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:30:01">0:30:01-0:30:11</a>:</strong>  What did you learn speaking to the traders and the companies that are currently part  of the 9 billion seriously flawed system, let's say?  Are they frustrated, excited, interested?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:30:11">0:30:11-0:30:18</a>:</strong>  What's the...  Yeah.  Like, it seems to be biodiversity is on the curve of having their hype moment like carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:30:18">0:30:18-0:30:28</a>:</strong>  has had, or soil carbon for at least a while.  What's the atmosphere in the sector?  Are they getting like, oh, finally somebody is tackling the measurement side?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:30:28">0:30:28-0:30:38</a>:</strong>  Or they're threatened because maybe they get disrupted?  What's the... or the companies are super excited because they want to do more?  What's the atmosphere?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:30:38">0:30:38-0:30:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  So the first thing is that all the people that we're talking to are on the voluntary  side because ultimately the regulated market has, you know, there's lots of places that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:30:48">0:30:48-0:30:57</a>:</strong>  we can go there.  You were actually speaking to people who develop properties, for example, and they have to  meet a biodiversity net gain requirement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:30:57">0:30:57-0:31:06</a>:</strong>  But the people that we're speaking to, when I say traders, they're people who are now  looking at a biodiversity credit and how they could put it on their platform, you know,  what they need, what they want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:31:06">0:31:06-0:31:16</a>:</strong>  And it's the same with the companies.  A lot of the companies that we're speaking to are not required to do this.  This is something that they see as of tremendous interest to their customers, to the person<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:31:16">0:31:16-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  walking on the street, and something that they need to address.  Some of them have been buying carbon credits for a long time.  So for example, there's a very large car manufacturer that we spoke to who has a lot of experience<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:41</a>:</strong>  and teams of people that buy carbon credits.  And basically their request was a biodiversity credit specifically, not something that's  tacked onto carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:31:41">0:31:41-0:32:00</a>:</strong>  In terms of the, let's see here, we're seeing a few other things.  For example, for people who are doing forestry and planting kind of biodiversity forests,  we're seeing people being offered a certain amount for the carbon credit, but then saying,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:32:00">0:32:00-0:32:10</a>:</strong>  look, quality of the project is incredibly important to us.  And so if you can also evidence the biodiversity gain, that's an excellent indicator of the  quality of the project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:32:10">0:32:10-0:32:18</a>:</strong>  We will increase the carbon price.  And you can link that carbon price to a biodiversity gain.  That's not a biodiversity credit per se, but it's a way of stacking biodiversity on top<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:32:18">0:32:18-0:32:28</a>:</strong>  of carbon.  So you avoid that issue of the monoculture forest plantations with the dead zone underneath  basically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:32:28">0:32:28-0:32:37</a>:</strong>  But yeah, we sort of have carbon in the tree.  Like, yeah, this is not really what we meant by reforestation.  So that almost becomes a guarantee.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:32:37">0:32:37-0:32:47</a>:</strong>  If biodiversity has gone up, we know that it must be a more diverse forest than some  of the horror pictures we see on some of these reports and articles.  Very interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:32:47">0:32:47-0:32:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  And then there's two other sets of people that it makes tremendous sense for us to work  with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:32:55">0:32:55-0:33:03</a>:</strong>  So one are investors.  So investors who are putting money into projects that they expect to have an income, some kind  of outcome for nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:33:03">0:33:03-0:33:13</a>:</strong>  And their comment is, look, we put hundreds of millions into a project.  How do we know that it's actually having the outcome for nature that we expect?  We think it should, but how do we really know?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:33:13">0:33:13-0:33:24</a>:</strong>  And so they're saying, well, we're prepared to now start putting into our operating budget  monitoring as just part of the cost of doing business.  And I would say that makes complete and absolute sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:33:24">0:33:24-0:33:35</a>:</strong>  If you're not monitoring, how do you know that you're actually having an outcome for  nature?  And the other is food groups who are saying to their farmers or making claims that they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:33:35">0:33:35-0:33:48</a>:</strong>  going to be moving to regenerative practices.  Well, how do they know what's actually happening on the ground?  And so I think one of the groups that we're going to start working with are large food<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:33:48">0:33:48-0:34:08</a>:</strong>  producers and helping them actually monitor outcomes on the ground so that they can incentivize  their own farmers in a way that if they create an outcome for nature, they get paid more.  And so let's step back one to you've done a few pilots now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:34:08">0:34:08-0:34:20</a>:</strong>  What's in the works before you or what needs to happen before you can work with all of  these fascinating, interesting, relevant groups that might come knocking on the door relatively  soon or some are, you're in many conversations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:34:20">0:34:20-0:34:32</a>:</strong>  How do you go from these pilots to something, quote unquote, a machine that does these things?  Like the company is a machine, not saying you should become a machine, but how do you  do hundreds of these?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:34:32">0:34:32-0:34:40</a>:</strong>  What's your idea there?  I mean, you've built companies before.  Funny enough in the life sciences, I would argue this is life science as well because<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:34:40">0:34:40-0:34:55</a>:</strong>  you're definitely studying life.  But what is needed in a year or so to start working and to get to a scale you can absorb  a lot of these projects and do hundreds of actors here, thousands of actors there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:34:55">0:34:55-0:35:07</a>:</strong>  What do you feel is missing still?  What do you need to get done apart from hiring people, obviously?  So our next pilot, our second pilot is actually going to be in Wiltshire on an agroforestry<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:35:07">0:35:07-0:35:14</a>:</strong>  farm.  I think that will be a lot easier than the one we just did on our first one.  It'll be slicker, great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:35:14">0:35:14-0:35:26</a>:</strong>  But then since we've done the first one, we've actually had an explosion of people asking  us to come and monitor in different ways.  So last week alone, there was a 700 hectare of regenerative farm that I visited.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:35:26">0:35:26-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  There was a call with another 700 hectare farm that went in Spain.  I spent time with the land steward at the largest estate in Holland, 6,800 hectares,  and they're doing amazing things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:58</a>:</strong>  And all of these would like to find ways to evidence the outcomes for nature that they're  creating in order to have real financial incentives be possible.  Some of them are very complicated because there's this dense thicket of subsidies that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:35:58">0:35:58-0:36:13</a>:</strong>  we need to sort of navigate.  But ultimately, if we want to change how land is used, we need to change incentives so that  there is an outcome for nature being incentivized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  And so in this hype of a hype, I don't call it a hype yet, but let's say a starting hype  around biodiversity, what would you tell investors that are getting interested in it that are,  let's imagine I tried to say, let's imagine we're in a theater, we're doing this in real<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:36</a>:</strong>  life.  It's a nice old theater.  We're sitting on stage, we're having this conversation there, which I hope will happen<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:36:36">0:36:36-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  at some point.  And the room is full of investors.  What would you tell them to look into after?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:50</a>:</strong>  Like when they get out and they're getting all excited about, okay, this biodiversity  piece is real.  There's something that we really, really need to crack there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:36:58</a>:</strong>  And let's not get into the carbon funnel only.  Let's not get tunnel vision, et cetera.  What would you give them, of course, not as investment advice, but what would we give<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:36:58">0:36:58-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  them to go deeper into?  Are there certain reports, places to visit, things to think like a mindset or a framework,  like when they walk out of the theater, what should be the first thing they do to go deeper<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:25</a>:</strong>  into this space, potentially put money to work, make investments, change things on their  farm or what kind of frameworks would you give them?  So I think the first thing is that when you look at biodiversity loss, one of the real<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:37:25">0:37:25-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  dominant drivers is of course land use.  It's how we produce food.  It's what we do with our land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:44</a>:</strong>  And I think when you're looking at the impact of your supply chains or your operations on  biodiversity, look where all your materials come from.  That's a good start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:37:44">0:37:44-0:37:54</a>:</strong>  You can work with consultancies to help sort of evaluate what that impact actually is and  you can get it right within, I don't know, even a factor of 10 is a good start at the  moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:37:54">0:37:54-0:38:05</a>:</strong>  And then you have a question as to what you then do.  And this is, again, part of what we're trying to solve.  At the end of that, how do you then directly just invest in something that helps offset<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:38:05">0:38:05-0:38:14</a>:</strong>  maybe your impact?  There is very little you can do to actually invest in an outcome.  And that's because the cost has been far too high.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:38:14">0:38:14-0:38:30</a>:</strong>  And so if we can bring down the cost, we can then create a wave of actually investing in  outcomes for nature, which people could then simply purchase on an exchange.  One way we might do that would be via an option so that if you have a game that is created,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:44</a>:</strong>  someone has pre-purchased that at an agreed price.  That allows the person on the ground to actually get investment to actually do that.  If the biodiversity does not actually appear, then you're not committed to buy it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:38:44">0:38:44-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  So how would it work?  Because that's like a farm, yeah, like one of the estates you talk about or let's say  a farm that says, we would love to do certain hedgerows.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:39:07</a>:</strong>  We would love to buy a much more complex cover crop mix.  We would love to integrate trees.  But of course, it's always like, yeah, these things have real impact, but it might take<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:39:07">0:39:07-0:39:18</a>:</strong>  five years or it might take X years.  How would, in the ideal world, biodiversity credits be used, like you mentioned now, to  fuel that change on the ground and then be interesting both for an investor, both for<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:39:18">0:39:18-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  a buyer and also for the land steward and or the farmer?  How would it work?  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:40</a>:</strong>  Well, I mean, firstly, the price that people pay for gains has to be set by the market.  And it has to be sufficient to enable people to be financially better off doing these things.  They may take a hit in one way, but be better off because they've increased biodiversity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:39:40">0:39:40-0:39:56</a>:</strong>  A great example would be for carbon projects where you could plant a model culture of eucalyptus  and that's going to be appalling for biodiversity in most cases.  On the other hand, if there is a biodiversity credit that goes alongside a carbon credit,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:39:56">0:39:56-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  you can choose.  We can allow people to simply look at how they will be financially better off.  And they really should, I think, be better off if they have a combination of carbon and<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:19</a>:</strong>  biodiversity in the mix.  I mean, one message I'd really like to make, I guess, to convey is that if you sequester  carbon, it's not a guaranteed outcome for biodiversity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:28</a>:</strong>  It's not always going to have a positive impact.  On the other hand, if you have a gain in biodiversity, there's almost always a carbon benefit as  well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:40:28">0:40:28-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  So it's more important to look at the biodiversity one.  That's the proxy for in many cases, of course, there are exceptions, et cetera.  But in many cases, it means you sequester carbon as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:50</a>:</strong>  It's very difficult to not do the two of them together.  But it's possible to do carbon and not biodiversity, as we just discussed in the Calypso or something  like that, which should trigger it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:40:50">0:40:50-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it should trigger the market.  One thing I find really interesting is that you talk to carbon developers and they say,  there's a real lack of projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:40:59">0:40:59-0:41:08</a>:</strong>  We struggled to find supply of projects.  And you have this incredibly ruthless attitude sometimes in some of these carbon project  developers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:41:08">0:41:08-0:41:18</a>:</strong>  And if you talk to the farmers that I've been speaking with and you say, would you like  to have carbon project on your farm?  90% will say no, and you're just not interested.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:41:18">0:41:18-0:41:24</a>:</strong>  If on the other hand, you said, would you like to restore biodiversity?  Why is that?  Because it's not sexy, interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:41:24">0:41:24-0:41:31</a>:</strong>  They can see it as potentially a lot of trouble.  Why is that strong no?  I think, well, I wouldn't want to speak for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:41:31">0:41:31-0:41:41</a>:</strong>  But I think it doesn't resonate with the people that I speak with.  On the other hand, if you say, would you like to restore nature on your farm?  Then the answer, of course, is an overwhelming yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:41:41">0:41:41-0:41:52</a>:</strong>  I mean, they love their farms.  They want to see it thriving and full of life.  And so I would say that from a supply point of view, restoring nature and having a biodiversity<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:41:52">0:41:52-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  credit is a message that clearly resonates with people far better than carbon.  And so I would say for any developers out there, you should bear that in mind.  Like the farmers or the people reaching out now that want their farm or their state or<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:22</a>:</strong>  whatever they manage to be surveyed, are they looking to do that out of their own pocket?  Are they hoping that you sell credits anytime soon?  Are they doing it because they have some clients or people that work with supply?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:42:22">0:42:22-0:42:29</a>:</strong>  I mean, like what's the reasoning?  Or they just want to do it and it's for them an expense.  Like we really want to do this baseline.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:42:29">0:42:29-0:42:36</a>:</strong>  And then what do you see?  What's their reasoning to reach out now, even though they know it's probably quite early?  There's not a clear market ready.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:42:36">0:42:36-0:42:49</a>:</strong>  There's not an exchange that they can sell credits tomorrow.  They might have to pay it for them by themselves and they are pioneering.  What's the reasoning to get in touch, even if it's quite early in this case?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:42:49">0:42:49-0:43:00</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I guess we see a few different motivations.  So with the regenerative farmers that we speak with, they're incredibly sincere.  They've been doing this for decades.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:43:00">0:43:00-0:43:09</a>:</strong>  The farm may have been in their family for generations.  They are very serious about what they're doing.  And they're always looking for ways to finance additional outcomes for nature to help prevent<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:43:09">0:43:09-0:43:19</a>:</strong>  any degradation on their farm.  Some of them are driven to do that because they've seen their crops starting to fail.  And I guess in different parts of the world that might be common.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:43:19">0:43:19-0:43:28</a>:</strong>  I was just in Holland and I was told that that's not something that they see.  I was also told something that's not something they see very often in the States.  I don't know if that's true or not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:43:28">0:43:28-0:43:41</a>:</strong>  But certainly some of the farmers I've been speaking with, that was one of their motivations.  Equally, we see people who are now looking at biodiversity as almost an investment they  can make.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:43:41">0:43:41-0:43:52</a>:</strong>  So they are buying land, they're intending to rewild it.  They expect to be able to increase the value of the land and to have a financial gain for  their investors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:43:52">0:43:52-0:44:06</a>:</strong>  And part of that is a strong biodiversity component.  And what they need is a tool that can help monitor affordably.  Right now, I think that's not something that they could do in an affordable sort of way,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:44:06">0:44:06-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  in any kind of robust way.  And then there's other people who are clearly doing this as just a way that they can have  a positive impact, but it's very financially driven.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  And we're seeing that, I guess, in a few different places.  I won't mention any projects, but it's also very worthwhile.  We should definitely do those two.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:41</a>:</strong>  Yeah, we need a lot more money, I would say, in this space or resources and energy to focus  on it because the underlying unconventional, inconvenient truth is that most of our landscapes  are severely degraded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:44:41">0:44:41-0:44:58</a>:</strong>  Even the nature, the nature areas, whatever we fenced off is not at its potential, let's  say in terms of life, it could support a lot more life and anything we can do to bring  that back or even not even bring that back because it sort of suggests there was a perfect<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:44:58">0:44:58-0:45:11</a>:</strong>  period before where it was intact, etc.  To bring it to its current, in the current context, highest potential in terms of biodiversity,  life, etc. would be a goal to look out for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:45:11">0:45:11-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  And then if you had, I always like to ask this question, not just the smart investor,  what should they focus on, but also what would you do if you had a magic wand and you could  change one thing in anything but let's say the land use or agriculture, even specifically<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:37</a>:</strong>  in a biodiversity space, what would you change if you had a magic wand and you could change  one thing overnight?  If I could change one thing overnight, I think I would.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:45:37">0:45:37-0:45:48</a>:</strong>  I think it's all about incentives.  I think it's all about creating real incentives for people because I don't think there's anything  else that really drives changes in behavior at the scale that we need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:46:03</a>:</strong>  And so I think there are many, many people out there who want to create outcomes for  nature, who want to restore nature and biodiversity.  But that means nothing if for most people they can't afford to do it or the incentives<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:46:03">0:46:03-0:46:12</a>:</strong>  are stacked against them.  And so I would say if I could snap my fingers, I would say...  Is there a specific thing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:46:12">0:46:12-0:46:19</a>:</strong>  Is it ELMS in the UK?  Is it the gap in Europe?  Anything in the US on the insurance side?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:46:19">0:46:19-0:46:33</a>:</strong>  Is there something you would target specifically?  Like, okay, if I could change one thing or would it be stop plowing?  What would the incentive be or we pay for nutrients, so quality over quantity?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:46:33">0:46:33-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  One thing I've been very reluctant to do is pass any judgment on what is actually going  to achieve these gains.  I think it's different in every single ecosystem, every single habitat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:52</a>:</strong>  You have to listen to ecologists.  You have to work with the farmers on the ground who are often very smart and they're using  the land as a way of experimenting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:46:52">0:46:52-0:47:02</a>:</strong>  How do we enable them?  And how do they become financially better off where every time they receive a payment,  it's because...<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:47:02">0:47:02-0:47:06</a>:</strong>  They did something.  Or an additional payment.  It's because they did something that was real that actually resulted in an outcome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:47:06">0:47:06-0:47:23</a>:</strong>  And I would say that could have a very rapid transformation on how we use land.  In terms of what land I would target, I would say the food system first.  If I could, I would have started this entire concept with the oceans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:47:23">0:47:23-0:47:32</a>:</strong>  I love marine protected areas.  I would love to have this concept start soon within, say, the next year or year and a half  moving to marine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:47:32">0:47:32-0:47:44</a>:</strong>  The issue is that land, we've got relatively good concepts around who owns land and how  you funnel incentives to people.  When it comes to marine, shorelines are owned by governments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:47:44">0:47:44-0:47:51</a>:</strong>  If it's a marine protected area and there's an incredible increase in biodiversity, who  do I pay?  How do I funnel money?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:47:51">0:47:51-0:48:03</a>:</strong>  And I would say, I think there are people who have some answers to these, but I think  everything about marine is a little more complicated.  Perhaps my answer is also, if I could stand my fingers, I would make this possible for<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:48:03">0:48:03-0:48:07</a>:</strong>  marine.  Very interesting answer.  I would agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:48:07">0:48:07-0:48:23</a>:</strong>  We have 70% of our earth and absolutely not 70% of our attention and resources and extremely  neglected.  Also there, there's the space to restore an abundance and a speed probably a lot faster<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:48:23">0:48:23-0:48:29</a>:</strong>  than on land.  We forget how much can come back, how quickly.  We see that in some of these marine protected areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:48:29">0:48:29-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  In a few years, life exploded again if we stopped overfishing and stopped dumping, et  cetera.  That's a financial question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  If we can pay, we can harvest relatively sustainably over time, but we need to restore quite a lot,  which means we need to stop for a while.  In that stopping period, you still need to eat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:48:57</a>:</strong>  There needs to be an incentive.  That money is there.  It's not getting to the people that then need to stop fishing, which are obviously not the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:48:57">0:48:57-0:49:03</a>:</strong>  richest people on this planet, but also the ones that are most affected by the crumbling  of that ecosystem.  Very, very interesting angle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:49:03">0:49:03-0:49:14</a>:</strong>  At the same time, on land, it's easier or it seems easier.  There's entities you can pay.  You know more or less who owns what.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:49:14">0:49:14-0:49:28</a>:</strong>  It's easy to see if somebody plowed or not, or the trees are still there.  I'm seeing a lot more attention for oceans and things, and a lot more attention for the  whole regenerative farming in oceans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:49:28">0:49:28-0:49:35</a>:</strong>  It's definitely a wave that's starting.  For sure, the acoustics are being built.  For sure, the sensors are being built.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:49:35">0:49:35-0:49:44</a>:</strong>  For sure, the modeling is being done.  Let's hope it moves quickly there.  There's one other thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:49:44">0:49:44-0:50:00</a>:</strong>  If I could snap my fingers again, I would have vertical farms everywhere.  I would have huge amounts of land freed up by some of the vertical farms that are doing  some really amazing work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:50:00">0:50:00-0:50:09</a>:</strong>  I think it is a smart solution.  It's something I think people should invest in.  I think it could take a lot of strain off of our land and leave that land free then<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:50:09">0:50:09-0:50:16</a>:</strong>  for rewilding and restoration.  Otherwise, we still need to farm on it.  I think that's just a reality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:50:16">0:50:16-0:50:31</a>:</strong>  I think the efficiency of the system makes it a no-brainer.  Yeah, I think we're going to get some emails about that because the reality there is that  the efficiency is very challenging still.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:50:31">0:50:31-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  I think for the lettuce, the higher end crops, absolutely.  The unfortunate truth is that most of our calories don't come from that.  Arbyn, the few wheat varieties we eat, they command most of the land we farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:50:50">0:50:50-0:51:02</a>:</strong>  I think it's extremely interesting.  It's very limited in terms of potential, I think in terms of calories you can grow.  The energy costs are, especially now, but the energy costs are coming down because of<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:51:02">0:51:02-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  efficiencies, because of renewables, obviously, but still the inputs are significant in terms  of materials simply to build them.  In terms of fertilizer that has to go in, of course, very efficiently, but still has<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:21</a>:</strong>  to be mined somewhere.  I've yet to see very advanced, let's say, bio-compost facilities doing that and making  the teas and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:51:21">0:51:21-0:51:38</a>:</strong>  The nutrient side is okay, but you cannot get to the highest level of nutrients we see  now in research if you don't grow it in soil, which you still can do inside, obviously.  It gets a lot of hype and it gets, rightfully so, some of the investments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:51:38">0:51:38-0:51:49</a>:</strong>  I think the potential is limited in terms of the calories we grow now.  If you want to get hectares under management, you look at soy, wheat, corn, et cetera, that  are rice as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:51:49">0:51:49-0:52:02</a>:</strong>  I think they're the impacts in terms of water, chemicals.  Biodiversity are massive because it's so much land or grasslands.  If we can make grasslands way more diverse, that really kicks off things for birds and<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:52:02">0:52:02-0:52:14</a>:</strong>  species because I think it's only a few percent in the US of agriculture land that's used  for vegetables.  Even though we have to change that, it's a very small percentage of the total land use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:52:14">0:52:14-0:52:17</a>:</strong>  I don't know.  I think we're...  I'm curious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:52:17">0:52:17-0:52:24</a>:</strong>  Reach out, people.  Do you have views on that?  I know I've invested in it a lot of money, but I've yet to see it go beyond the higher<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:52:24">0:52:24-0:52:36</a>:</strong>  end things for restaurants, which of course we shouldn't ship around the world, and go  beyond...  I've yet to see anybody do corn, et cetera, at scale inside because it seems like the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:52:36">0:52:36-0:52:43</a>:</strong>  economics just don't make sense yet.  Any input side is...  They often say it's fully closed, et cetera, but fertilization has to come from somewhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:52:43">0:52:43-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  It doesn't grow for free.  The energy costs now, especially we're in an energy crunch, it's just massive and doesn't  allow to do many things, but it's a path to check.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:53:09</a>:</strong>  I guess I'm just going on some of the conversations I've had with some of the vertical farming  companies that I've spoken with.  I think clearly it's not affordable for staple crops, which is obviously a shame, but there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:53:09">0:53:09-0:53:21</a>:</strong>  more that's grown than just staple crops.  I think if anything you can do to take pressure off the land, I think it's where I'm going.  I would just argue that if you want to take pressure off the land, you would look at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:53:21">0:53:21-0:53:32</a>:</strong>  majority of crops we grow on the land, or the larger ones, and see if we can make significant  changes there compared to the few percent we use currently for vegetables, even though  we shouldn't ship that from California to New York.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:53:32">0:53:32-0:53:48</a>:</strong>  That doesn't make any sense to ship lettuce in a truck, obviously.  The nutrient side of things, I think we need, no, the research shows that there are some  limitations there when you take out the soil pieces, especially.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:53:48">0:53:48-0:54:04</a>:</strong>  I see now, close to where I was born in Rotterdam, you see a lot of greenhouses, not on the vertical  side, they're definitely relatively flat, but the energy prices at the moment, the gas  prices, et cetera, just make it very challenging to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:54:04">0:54:04-0:54:15</a>:</strong>  They need the electricity, they need the CO2 to be burned, actually, or they need the CO2  to be released to grow even faster because of the high ground prices underneath.  It's a challenging tension there at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:54:15">0:54:15-0:54:31</a>:</strong>  I wouldn't want to be in their shoes as we speak, but what would you do?  Actually, it's a good question, a good bridge to if you'd be in charge of a 1 billion euro,  1 billion pound, 1 billion dollar, I mean, you can pick your currency, investment fund,<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:54:31">0:54:31-0:54:40</a>:</strong>  what would you focus on?  What would be your, of course, not onto the, I don't need the dollar amount exactly, but  what would be your priorities if you had to put that to work with the longest timeframe<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:54:40">0:54:40-0:54:51</a>:</strong>  you can imagine if you want to, or you can put it all to work in a few years and go after  a VC approach?  What would be your focus?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:54:51">0:54:51-0:55:04</a>:</strong>  I think the answer for me is in incentivizing changes in the way land is used.  I would invest in land use, whether for food production or not, that encourages coexistence  with nature, but not necessarily land acquisition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:55:04">0:55:04-0:55:15</a>:</strong>  I think incentives for the people who already own the land to manage it differently.  I think create incentives based on outcomes.  I think tools to evaluate the relative value of gains in biodiversity are needed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:55:15">0:55:15-0:55:24</a>:</strong>  Of course, that's what we're offering or working to offer.  I think the financial incentives for gains that are measured in real, if you have those,  you can change the balance towards-<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:55:24">0:55:24-0:55:35</a>:</strong>  How would that gain look like?  What would be a biodiversity, maybe you're still thinking about that, but a biodiversity  gain, maybe I should have asked this question earlier, but what would a biodiversity gain<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:55:35">0:55:35-0:55:49</a>:</strong>  look like if I want to buy that or sell it, depending on which side I am?  I guess what it would look like probably would be not one index, but multiple different things.  You would have-<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:55:49">0:55:49-0:56:00</a>:</strong>  A dashboard.  Yeah, sort of a dashboard, and you need to then compress that into something simple.  This is one of the things that speaking to commodity traders, they emphasized is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:56:00">0:56:00-0:56:08</a>:</strong>  understanding what you're looking at needs to be fairly straightforward and simple.  I would say-  Because not everybody is an ecologist that can read those things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:56:08">0:56:08-0:56:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  They need to not care what it is per se and still be able to understand its relative value.  I think it also needs to be linked to the habitat types or habitat classification.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:56:20">0:56:20-0:56:37</a>:</strong>  For that, we're going to use the IUCN habitat classifications.  You can have units of change as measured by multiple different indices and put together  into a number that makes sense in some sort of way, along with the habitat classification.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:56:37">0:56:37-0:56:49</a>:</strong>  I think if you have that, that's then a tradable asset.  The units that you measure, the indices that you choose, they need to be non-redundant.  They need to be sensitive to change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:56:49">0:56:49-0:56:59</a>:</strong>  I think this is, again, you need the right people working on these.  If you have an ecologist PhD mathematician, I think it's something you then need, obviously,  feedback on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:56:59">0:56:59-0:57:14</a>:</strong>  I think we can lead the way in creating something that really is robust and makes a lot of sense.  We have seen examples of people constructing pseudo-credits.  A lot of the time, the math goes out the window, which I think is not okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:57:14">0:57:14-0:57:29</a>:</strong>  We've discussed a few of these already, but if you had to pick one where you are contrary,  and this is a question that definitely is inspired by John Kemp, I always ask, where  do you think within, and I ask it within Regender of Agriculture, but where do you think different<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:57:29">0:57:29-0:57:40</a>:</strong>  when you are visiting a conference?  I mean, these are real times to visit conferences, but when you are with your peers or in the  biodiversity scene, where do you clearly think different?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:57:40">0:57:40-0:57:49</a>:</strong>  Is it on the tech side?  Is it on what you believe to be true that others don't in this space?  We've mentioned a few, but if you had to pick one, what would you pick?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:57:49">0:57:49-0:58:00</a>:</strong>  I'm going to actually finish the previous question because there's something else I  want to mention.  If I had that billion dollars, yes, it's incentives, but actually, it's also focusing on a physical<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:58:00">0:58:00-0:58:09</a>:</strong>  scale.  I would prioritize landscape scale.  I think if you have that much money, I think investing in land use change, you should go<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:58:09">0:58:09-0:58:21</a>:</strong>  really big.  Prioritize huge parcels of land in areas that are naturally highly biodiverse.  You would almost pick one landscape or a landscape to show, or like, look, this can be done if<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:58:21">0:58:21-0:58:32</a>:</strong>  you do this at an integrated, large, holistic scale.  If you pick the right pieces, we can significantly gain biodiversity at a landscape scale, which  is something that people doubt about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:58:32">0:58:32-0:58:45</a>:</strong>  We usually talk on a field level, we talk about, and we don't really say, okay, what  does it take to bring back this river or to stabilize biodiversity loss here or to stop  the erosion or to stabilize local climates?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:58:45">0:58:45-0:58:56</a>:</strong>  I mean, these are the dreams we need to have if we want to do something.  Would you focus that you think a billion dollars is enough to positively influence a landscape?  I think so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:58:56">0:58:56-0:59:05</a>:</strong>  I think so.  I think you can look at thousands of hectares.  You can look at parcels where, like if you look at the UN, there's a thing called the<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:59:05">0:59:05-0:59:09</a>:</strong>  UN Biodiversity Lab, for example.  It's free.  It's a map that anyone can look at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:59:09">0:59:09-0:59:21</a>:</strong>  It has many different layers.  You can look at what they call the global significance of different biodiversity areas.  I would pick areas that have a high significance, find a degraded landscape where an ecologist<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:59:21">0:59:21-0:59:27</a>:</strong>  tells you there's a decent chance you can restore it.  I would focus on that.  For me, it's not a question of, can you restore these areas?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:59:27">0:59:27-0:59:35</a>:</strong>  You absolutely can.  There's plenty of examples.  I would say, if you just plant trees, that is not a guarantee of anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:59:35">0:59:35-0:59:42</a>:</strong>  On the other hand, if you take some time, think about it, work with ecologists, you  absolutely can.  I have no doubt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:59:42">0:59:42-0:59:56</a>:</strong>  I've seen lots of examples of this.  I would say, when it comes to really large areas, you could actually see greater changes  for biodiversity, greater gains for biodiversity because, of course, different species have<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=0:59:56">0:59:56-1:00:02</a>:</strong>  different habitat ranges.  The more space you leave, actually, the greater the impact you can have.  I would say-<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:00:02">1:00:02-1:00:05</a>:</strong>  There's a network effect.  Economies.  That's a bad word.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:00:05">1:00:05-1:00:18</a>:</strong>  The economies of biodiversity of scale or the biodiversity scalability is there if you  do it.  The larger you get, stuff gets more space, meaning more things can live there and thrive<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:00:18">1:00:18-1:00:26</a>:</strong>  there.  Yeah.  I would say, if you really wanted to have the biggest impact possible, pick areas where...<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  I know there are areas in the world which are a little bit degraded or have been used  as grassland recently.  If you just leave them alone, you can see massive changes in just a few years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:47</a>:</strong>  There's plenty of these.  There's more than enough for people to invest.  I don't know if a billion dollars is enough, but it would certainly get you a long way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:00:47">1:00:47-1:01:03</a>:</strong>  If you're not purchasing the land, which is incredibly capital intensive, and you're instead  focusing on how do you have a business model which uses the incentives that you can create  by being able to measure outcomes for biodiversity, all of a sudden, that is a very powerful lever<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:01:03">1:01:03-1:01:15</a>:</strong>  that you can pull.  It's a very interesting conversation we've had many times on the podcast.  The most established part of Regenac, investing at least, are these land funds, which are<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:01:15">1:01:15-1:01:22</a>:</strong>  amazing.  SLM, Clear Frontier, there are many of these.  I'm forgetting a few, but they are purchasing the land, like a real estate play, purchasing<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:01:22">1:01:22-1:01:32</a>:</strong>  the land, purchasing the building, seeing value somewhere where nobody else sees it,  clean it up, make it super energy efficient, et cetera, et cetera.  Then either sell it, rent it out for a while, et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:01:32">1:01:32-1:01:39</a>:</strong>  That's very established.  It's amazing, but there is a limit of scale because there's only so much land you can  buy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:01:39">1:01:39-1:01:46</a>:</strong>  There's a limit of money because there's only so much money you can raise for things like  that.  I have no doubt that hundreds of millions, probably many billions actually, will flow<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:01:46">1:01:46-1:01:55</a>:</strong>  into that space because it's the most established institution investors like it, et cetera, et  cetera.  We have to think beyond that and also ask questions on concentrated land ownership.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:01:55">1:01:55-1:02:05</a>:</strong>  Do we want this to be in a few hands or not, even though it might be pension funds, et  cetera?  Do we want to work with farmers, landowners, land stewards, national parks, whatever, to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:02:05">1:02:05-1:02:18</a>:</strong>  not having to buy that but influencing positively without owning it because we don't need to?  Of course, the biodiversity gains or the gains in general can be a way to do that.  I think then a billion dollars goes quite a long way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:02:18">1:02:18-1:02:36</a>:</strong>  Still, you have to be very smart of how to structure that, but I think that we're going  to see a lot of smart people going after that because that's where, how do you partner with  landowners and land stewards that manage large pieces and help them to speed up their transition<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:02:36">1:02:36-1:02:44</a>:</strong>  or to speed up the transition of land and the sea of land?  I think that's right.  Actually, the very first set of concept I explored a couple of years ago was exactly<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:02:44">1:02:44-1:02:52</a>:</strong>  this.  What would it look like if you simply started purchasing land in order to improve it?  Buying degraded land, trying to restore it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:02:52">1:02:52-1:03:02</a>:</strong>  What does that model look like?  In the end, I think what we've chosen to do is something much more scalable and much more  efficient.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:03:02">1:03:02-1:03:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  I've had some investors, if they're listening, they will know who I'm talking about that  made that calculation like how far does my money go in terms of investing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:03:11">1:03:11-1:03:21</a>:</strong>  Of course, looking at the return, but also looking at the carbon return and in this case,  biodiversity return and not owning the land or not buying the land and make their euros  and dollars go a lot further.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:03:21">1:03:21-1:03:30</a>:</strong>  I want to be conscious of your time and thank you so much for this lesson and sharing your  knowledge and your current status.  I know you were doubting a bit, like, should I come on?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:03:30">1:03:30-1:03:42</a>:</strong>  We're so early, but we love to follow things early.  We love to check in early and then follow it over time because just like with gains  and biodiversity gains, you need to be there early, do a good baseline, check in, start<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:03:42">1:03:42-1:03:55</a>:</strong>  building the relationship and then keep coming back and sharing lessons learned, new pilots,  first credits are going to be sold at some point, et cetera, et cetera.  Thank you so much for coming on early and sharing your work in progress.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:03:55">1:03:55-1:04:06</a>:</strong>  And of course, thank you for the work you do.  Well, thank you and thanks for the invitation.  Thank you so much for listening all the way to the end.<br />

<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:04:42">1:04:42-1:04:55</a>:</strong>  Dear friends of the podcast, I'm super excited to share with you the online video course  investing in regenerative agriculture and food, how to put money to work in regenerating  soils at scale and growing a lot of tasty food while doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:04:55">1:04:55-1:05:05</a>:</strong>  Why are we doing this course?  After a hundred interviews and more than a hundred hours of audio asking the question  how to put money to work in regenerating soils and have been following the space since 2011<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:05:05">1:05:05-1:05:15</a>:</strong>  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  How have we built our decision making framework?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:05:15">1:05:15-1:05:22</a>:</strong>  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees?  What questions should you ask?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:05:22">1:05:22-1:05:25</a>:</strong>  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:05:25">1:05:25-1:05:30</a>:</strong>  What should you watch?  How to approach this space?  For whom is this course?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:05:30">1:05:30-1:05:43</a>:</strong>  You, the soil builders and investors in this space.  The soil builders, people working in this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers,  vehicle builders, crowd investing, platform builders, ag tech companies, farm to gut food<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:05:43">1:05:43-1:05:53</a>:</strong>  companies, permaculture, key line designers, holistic management, consultants, etc.  People that are building soil at scale.  And the investors who are putting their own money to work through their family office<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:05:53">1:05:53-1:06:04</a>:</strong>  or as private individuals or people who are putting other people's money to work through  foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies, etc.  Is this course free?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:06:04">1:06:04-1:06:11</a>:</strong>  No.  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:06:11">1:06:11-1:06:22</a>:</strong>  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  different means.  So I'm inviting you, if this course is creating value to you and if you have the means to<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:06:22">1:06:22-1:06:27</a>:</strong>  consider paying what you think it's worth.  Thank you.  So what is this course?<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:06:27">1:06:27-1:06:40</a>:</strong>  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides  so you don't have to write along.  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:06:40">1:06:40-1:06:52</a>:</strong>  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  if you're a soil builder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:06:52">1:06:52-1:07:06</a>:</strong>  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design and a lot more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:07:06">1:07:06-1:07:11</a>:</strong>  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:07:11">1:07:11-1:07:22</a>:</strong>  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/cameron-frayling#t=1:07:22">1:07:22-1:07:31</a>:</strong>  So get ready, get a cup of coffee, a cup of tea or whatever you're drinking.
