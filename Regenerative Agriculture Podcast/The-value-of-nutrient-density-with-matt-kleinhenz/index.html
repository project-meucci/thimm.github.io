On this  show we explore the science of growing exceptional crops and we work to describe why you have  crop challenges and possible disease and insect pests, fruit quality challenges, and how you<br />

Our goal is to give you really clear and understandable information  that you can put into action to help you grow better crops, grow healthier, higher quality  food, and be more successful as a farmer. Many farmers have challenges. They have a<br />

In this episode of the show, I'm excited to welcome Matt Kleinhans<br />

Matt is a professor of horticulture and crop science and is very  interested in understanding the dynamics of produce quality and food quality and then  how that also connects to buyers in the marketplace. So Matt, we're very excited to have you join<br />

Thank you very much for having me. So Matt, you've done a lot  of interesting work over your decades at Ohio State University and before. What are some  of the memorable moments that have brought you to the spot where you are today and the<br />

Some of the most memorable moments specific  to my career really spring from or involve interactions with growers and other members  of the industry that brought to me a question or an issue that they wanted some input on.<br />

And  the questions ranged, in this case, they often focused on how to produce more of a better<br />

So when growers are expressing the desire to produce a higher  quality product, is that demand often coming from buyers? Is that demand coming from perhaps<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:02:20">0:02:20-0:02:37</a>:</strong>  an altruistic sense that the grower has of producing healthier food? What drives the  desire to produce higher quality? In my experience, John, it's been both. Sometimes a grower has  their own view, of course, their own ethic, their own aspirations. And they simply see<br />

In other cases, if you will,  it's a little bit less altruistic. It has a business sense behind it. And there may<br />

And so they're responding  to a real business scene, if you will. When growers have a desire to improve quality,<br />

What are they, and possibly there are some  variations from crop to crop, but in general, what do you see growers seeking to produce?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:03:21">0:03:21-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  It's a great question. And I've been privileged to try to address that question in different  settings through the years, one-on-one conversations, much like this, but also in a group setting,  maybe even as a person that was asked to comment to a select committee, if you will. And the<br />

And we typically start with establishing, at least for the  immediate conversation, what quality is or how it's defined in the eyes of that particular  person or group. Because it has physical components, it has chemical components, it has biological<br />

But they may be focused on one particular property. It might  be the shape, the size, the texture, the aroma, the flavor, the color, what have you. They<br />

So I would say that there<br />

It's ranged. But over that time, it has covered, as far as  I can tell, a very large number of properties that we look at in our fruits and vegetables,<br />

Recently I've been a part of a number of conversations where growers are expressing the desire to  improve the nutritional value. Sometimes they use the language of nutrient density and talk<br />

And my observations have been that for the  most part, the consumers at this stage and buyers aren't really having a conversation,  at least not on a large scale, about nutrient density, that in general, kind of the analog<br />

What have you observed? And do you think there is the potential in  the future to have a major market demand for quote-unquote nutrient-dense foods?<br />

First of all, nutritional  value or nutrient density is a significant passion of mine, and I know it's a significant<br />

But they're  working tirelessly and quite impressively towards a similar goal, but within their lane,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:33">0:06:33-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  if you will, regarding understanding what nutritional value is and how it can be enhanced.  So it is a big passion of mine.  So second part of the question, I think we need often to be very specific when we talk<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:07:07</a>:</strong>  about nutritional value, nutritional density. It is a complex topic and we don't wave our  hands and say, well, just because it's complex, we can't understand it or we shouldn't approach  it. No, quite the opposite. We should stay on task. We should continue to focus on how<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:07">0:07:07-0:07:23</a>:</strong>  a farm can become an instrument of public health, if you will, producing a more nutritious  product, a more so-called nutrient dense product, a more flavorful product, a product that is  more desirable to eat simply because of its chemical, biological, or physical properties.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:07:23">0:07:23-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  These are all parts of the process, in my view, towards the produce that we offer to  folks playing a larger role in their maintaining or enhancing their quality of life, especially  through their health status. To the final point, will there be a market, will there<br />

I think so, but  we're not there yet. I think that interest already is strong within a small, if you will,  community of eaters or a community of buyers and where there is those so-called beachheads,<br />

Whereas now, here in 2018,  we might say if we were able to do a grand survey, one half of one percent of people  make decisions around nutritional value. Some years down the road, we might be able to say<br />

In that increase, there will be so many opportunities for enterprising  growers to be a part of that process that it will become that much more noticeable.  As I think about the question of quote-unquote nutrient density, it seems to me that there<br />

On one hand, there is a conversation about food biofortification, growing specific plants  that have higher concentrations of needed vitamins or minerals that are needed by a<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:08:58">0:08:58-0:09:17</a>:</strong>  specific portion of the population and growing biofortified foods that can really help supply  those nutritional requirements. Then there is a second conversation happening around  foods and crops that have inherently high nutrient density by default, such as blueberries<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:17">0:09:17-0:09:38</a>:</strong>  or kale, for example. Then there is a bit of a third conversation happening that believes  that we have lost substantial nutrient value in all crops generally across the board over  the last 40, 50, 80 years, whatever timeframe here in North America. In particular, I've<br />

What is your perspective, particularly on  this latter piece? Is there evidence to support that we have lost a lot of nutrient density  in our food supply?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:09:48">0:09:48-0:10:07</a>:</strong>  Well, it's possible. As a matter of fact, I had a very lengthy conversation on the very  same topic just two days ago with another grower and members of the farm's team. They  asked the very same question. Is there evidence that we've lost nutrient value over time,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:07">0:10:07-0:10:25</a>:</strong>  particularly within, if you will, our fruit and vegetable crops, our specialty crops?  My area focuses vegetables. Forgive me if I happen to focus primarily on those as examples.  It's just because I'm more familiar with them as organisms and as products and as experimental<br />

The vegetable crops tend to be where I turn my focus in conversations  like these. I'm aware that the picture is much larger. It involves, obviously, everything  that we could eat and can eat. I know that there have been reports suggesting that that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:57</a>:</strong>  is the case, that the nutrient density of the US food supply or perhaps global food  supply has declined over a number of decades. I have no reason to question those reports  at this point in time, but I also have no reason to go out and shout from the rooftops<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:10:57">0:10:57-0:11:15</a>:</strong>  that the sky is falling. I think the devil is in the details, if you will, if I could  use that phrase as an academic and an investigator and also hopefully an educator and a consultant,  advisor. I have to be very, very clear on the source of the information, how the information<br />

I look at the reports,  I look at the data and I say, well, that might be the case. There are pretty understandable  reasons for that. I'm not justifying it as a trend. I'm saying, look at what has happened<br />

It can't be seen as a separate phenomenon from how  we've taken on our day-to-day lives. As I think as we began this conversation, how we've<br />

Growers respond  to what the market asks them. They are business people par excellence most of the time. They're  working – I don't need to tell anybody on this call what it means to be a grower and<br />

What does the market demand? If the market has not demanded  nutritional value, does not reward them financially for it, but instead rewards them for abundance,<br />

Who should  fault them? I guess I'll leave that part of the question. There were other parts of that  same biofortification piece and whether or not there are products that are inherently<br />

We can return to those if you like or we can  move on.  Well, the follow-up question that I would have to your response, and I absolutely agree<br />

Of course, this is not just because of buyer  demand but perhaps also because of the mantra that has been adopted by the agriculture industry  as a whole for the need to quote-unquote feed the world. And that has been a kind of a subconscious<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:50</a>:</strong>  driving force I would expect for many growers that has – and of course, we have the economic  incentives, which are a major primary incentive to incentivize growers to produce large volumes  and abundance perhaps at the expense of quality and perhaps not.<br />

I'd say, and it's just  a conversation among friends here, I'd say that in an individual grower's decision on  how they approach the management of their farm and their crops, of course, I can't climb<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:14:08">0:14:08-0:14:26</a>:</strong>  inside somebody's head. But what I've observed over the years is that they have their farm  and their own personal welfare in mind first, the health of the industry second, and they  have to have a hierarchy, they have to have priorities. And what I've seen is we don't<br />

No, these are day in, day out, season in, season out decisions that  a grower makes regarding what they grow, who they sell it to, and what price are they receiving,<br />

And little by little, farm by farm, region  by region, if you will, industry by industry, one could look at the cabbage industry or  the lettuce industry or various industries. They're not monolithic. There's quite a diversity<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:15:01">0:15:01-0:15:23</a>:</strong>  within each. But you say, look at them farm by farm, area by area, and say over time,  national transfer over time, people have chosen to respond to the opportunities that so far  on the whole do not reward producing less but of higher nutritional value, simply because<br />

There just aren't enough people  that will pay more for the same product if it's claimed to be more higher nutritionally  dense than the product that's not. Because they're responding to their pocketbook. So<br />

Moreover, what evidence will I provide that my claim  is true? And on what will I base it? We talk about nutritional value as if it is one thing,<br />

There are many components of nutritional value.  But most of the time the conversations speak of it as if it is eye color. You know, it's  not, it's a very complex attribute of a food item. And I think to understand it fully and<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:16:41">0:16:41-0:16:59</a>:</strong>  its origins fully, like how is it shaped, one needs to really study it and be prepared  to adopt at least temporarily some reductionist thinking. And then reassemble all that, all  pieces that come from that reductionist thinking into something that's more holistic.<br />

This is, I  believe this entire conversation has been one area of confusion, particularly within  the organic industry. And I know, I'm certain that many of the growers who are listening<br />

And then a short while later, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:17:35">0:17:35-0:17:51</a>:</strong>  a rebuttal from the organic industry that, oh, in fact, organic foods are supposedly  more nutritious than conventional foods. And this is kind of this back and forth that has  been happening for quite some time. I've seen the cycle repeat itself multiple times. And<br />

It does absolutely nothing to certify the quality of the end product in terms of  nutritional value or otherwise. It is purely a process certification that says a certain<br />

It makes no reference to quality. And so I think, or  to nutritional value. And so I think there's this conversation happening around nutritional<br />

And so it's almost as if they're succeeding thanks to<br />

Then in some cases,  the answer is right before them, if only they had understood a little bit more about their  crop. And so I guess the one thing that can, you know, kind of confuses me or has struck<br />

So to your question about  pieces, you know, what are the important pieces? I would include in that, you know, obviously  what they're doing on a day to day basis, the business of farming, the process of farming,<br />

Well, there are very simple devices to record  temperature. One can measure obviously rainfall and so forth, flow meters on the irrigation.  There are steps that can be taken that will describe their system, if you will, to them<br />

And in the process, they've not changed really anything about their farming practice. They  simply know more about it actually. And soil testing would be another obvious example.<br />

I'll say myself, I value that information.  I'd say, boy, if I had more input, if I had more data, so to speak, if I had more information,<br />

So that's one piece. Just  take, observe, take notes, record as much as is reasonable and be strategic about it.  The second part would be read, listen. If videos are an option for you, watch credible<br />

Be healthily skeptical of what you're seeing and reading. Don't accept 100% at face  value just about anything, but don't be so skeptical that you accept nothing. You know,  be an informed consumer of information. And as you deal with the confusion that can come<br />

And I think in the long run,  the quality information rises and then you can, you know, rely on it. It can be put to  better use. So I'd say employ as many ways of knowing as a person can consistently and<br />

Take notes, you know, record, take pictures and go over  them and in your spare time, do some reading.  Matt, your comments bring so many thoughts to mind. I have a few to share. I'll perhaps<br />

In one of his articles, he  wrote the quote, read books and study nature and when the two don't agree, you throw out  the books. And I think, of course, there's an element of humor in that, but the fundamental,<br />

In order to be able to throw out the books, that means you need to<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  have very high quality observation, which goes to the point that you're making as observation  is absolutely key in being able to understand what's going on.  Absolutely. You know, through those observations, one might be able to write their own book,<br />

That maybe somebody later will throw away or maybe not, maybe that book will remain,  you know, quite viable and informative for a very long time. So, yeah, absolutely. There  is, I don't want to say there's a lifetime to all information so much as there is a lifetime<br />

And what we see, I think, in the evolution of  understanding of people's business is their reliant change in what information they rely  on or seek, okay? As they become more proficient at certain areas of their business, they no<br />

So if we boom running  back, John, just for a real quick second, we boom running back to the question of nutritional<br />

How would  a dietician, nutritionist, a health professional define it? Not as it's being defined by people  who are recycling information. I want to go to the primary source and ask, well, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:15">0:27:15-0:27:34</a>:</strong>  do they do with it? Well, you know, there are people, professionals of one stripe or  another that have written some very impressive, provided some very impressive resources on  nutritional value of various food items. And learning from that primary source can be enormously<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:27:34">0:27:34-0:27:50</a>:</strong>  important. So to bring this back, you know, ways of knowing about the farm, what to do  with one's soil, you know, what to do with one's whatever, you know, aspect of the farming  operation. If one looks for input and doesn't find it, that's a cue on something. That's<br />

And so  they are at the so-called cutting edge of understanding it.  One of the pieces that we've observed in working with growers, we've observed one characteristic<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:05">0:28:05-0:28:23</a>:</strong>  of growers that are exceptionally successful that has really stood out, which is these  most successful growers seek to understand the answer to the question is, how do you  make money? How do they make money? And so if for many, particularly for fruit and vegetable<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:23">0:28:23-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  crops, as you mentioned at the beginning, oftentimes, the key to having a successful  profitable crop is some quality component, whether it might be fruit size or fruit shape,  or a specific firmness, there are often very specific fruit characteristics or vegetable<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:29:01</a>:</strong>  characteristics that are desired by the market. And one of the things that we've observed  is that the most successful growers seek to understand that specific characteristic and  how to manage it. They don't delegate that piece to an agronomist or a consultant or<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:01">0:29:01-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  an advisor. They want to understand if the key to having a profitable tomato crop is  having a high soluble solids content, what are the specific components and factors that  contribute to achieving a high percentage of soluble solids. So they focus in on that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:39</a>:</strong>  piece specifically, and they want to make sure that they personally understand that  very deeply. They don't delegate that knowledge. And I think this speaks to this entire conversation  of what are the important pieces for us to learn about as growers, I think really understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:39">0:29:39-0:29:58</a>:</strong>  the pieces that contribute to profitability can be a very valuable place to begin.  No question, I agree with you completely. They don't delegate in part because consciously  or subconsciously, they recognize that quality is the target. In my perspective, quality<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:29:58">0:29:58-0:30:16</a>:</strong>  is the platform for repeat sales. One might be able to make the initial sale based on  some other factor, but the repeat sale comes from the quality as one enormously influential  component of the overall value that the buyer sees in the product. Of course, there's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:16">0:30:16-0:30:41</a>:</strong>  price quality interaction, but one never really wants to be racing for the bottom price, do  they? In that scenario, the importance of quality is diminishing, and as the price rises,  the value of quality in that calculation in the buyer's mind increases. So my argument<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:41">0:30:41-0:30:58</a>:</strong>  has been you want a better price, raise the quality. Improve the value of the transaction  that you're trying to consummate with the buyer by offering them something in return  that is going to prompt them to give you more money for the product as far as ways of knowing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:30:58">0:30:58-0:31:16</a>:</strong>  and many on this. So if one goes to the produce auction and they see what's being bought,  what the prices are, that is immediate feedback on what sells and what does not sell, correct?  I mean, there's no more dramatic demonstration than at the farmer's market on Saturday or<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:16">0:31:16-0:31:38</a>:</strong>  at the produce auction or wherever one can see another person's product and what is being  sold, purchased, and what price. And to be a student of that transaction, I think, is  one way of improving one's operation. Understand why yours was purchased or not, and understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:38">0:31:38-0:31:54</a>:</strong>  why it got the price that it did and how it could possibly go higher. And in as much as  quality is a fat force in that, understand what the buyers are responding to. It could  be the color, it could be the shape, it could be the consistency, whatever it is. Remember,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:31:54">0:31:54-0:32:14</a>:</strong>  those physical, chemical, biological components of it. If it happens to be nutritional value  or the holistic expectation that the buyer has about it enhancing their diet in some  way, study it and understand the origin. And I know that Brix or Total Soluble Solids is<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:14">0:32:14-0:32:38</a>:</strong>  on many people's minds, but Brix is not a nutritional component. It has little bearing  on nutrition, specifically. Nutrition as people who study nutrition for a living define nutrition.  Brix has other implications, but they rarely include nutrition, specifically. And so as<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:38">0:32:38-0:32:52</a>:</strong>  I say, be a student of it and agreeing with you completely. The grower rarely delegates  what's most important because it tends to be something they want to have more control  over, be more informed about. And in the case of quality, it's often the target of what<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  they're trying to produce.  Matt, what do you believe to be true about agriculture today that many other people don't  believe to be true?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:21</a>:</strong>  Well, I hear from so many people and I hear so many different perspectives on agriculture.  I hear that it's going to heck in a handbasket. I hear that it's enjoying a complete revitalization  and everything in between. So I hesitate to say, to point to one area and say, oh, this<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:39</a>:</strong>  is something that people don't believe to be true. But I would say that there are areas  that are topics that I hear about less than other areas. And I would say one of those  that I hear less about that I'm not sure people more widely appreciate is what role the grower<br />

They're part of a fabric  that is ensuring our access as consumers to healthy, nutritious, safe, and enjoyable to  eat, please and do eat food day in, day out, meal in, meal out. They're kind of like this<br />

That's unfortunate,  but there are probably a number of reasons for that. So what do I believe to be true?  They're often underappreciated, underrecognized, but they keep on going just like we hope that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  they do and have done for so long.  So within that, obviously you've thought about this a little bit, and you believe that growers  are underappreciated, which I absolutely agree with. Have you given any thought to how that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:55</a>:</strong>  might be remedied?  Well, I think not to share enough popular idea, but I think they need to ask more of  themselves. And I also think that they could benefit from being a bit more assertive professionally<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:34:55">0:34:55-0:35:15</a>:</strong>  about what they do, how, and why, and what role they play. It's obviously, you know,  there are dozens of possible responses to that. Some people will become activists, if  you will. Some people will become involved in grower organizations. Some people will<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:15">0:35:15-0:35:35</a>:</strong>  keep it one-on-one and simply have excellent conversations with their buyers on Saturday  mornings or wherever they happen to encounter them, all of which are necessary. But on the  whole, I would encourage folks to use the opportunity to display their understanding<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:35:35">0:35:35-0:35:55</a>:</strong>  of the farm's role and the food's role in that person's life, because too many of our  eaters, a lot of our eaters, more or less just eat to avoid being hungry, right? Which  is entirely fine. It's a choice. Others, though, look to food for other types of, if you will,<br />

You know, it's an enjoyable experience. So when a grower encounters a  person or market that might be wired that way, might be thinking of food differently,  if you will, having higher expectations of it, ideally, I'd like the grower to be able<br />

Have  a real foundational argument for whatever assertion that they would like to make. But  a lot of us, understandable, and a lot of us are on the farm doing our thing and being<br />

Yeah, I completely agree with what you've described. And one of the pieces that really<br />

They  communicate why they make the choices that they make and the decisions that they make.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:11">0:37:11-0:37:30</a>:</strong>  There certainly is an element of describing what they do and how they do what they do.  But I think the most, from my observation, the most important piece that resonates most  deeply with eaters is kind of describing why you need to make these various decisions and<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:30">0:37:30-0:37:46</a>:</strong>  these various choices that the consumer may or may not necessarily agree with. But when  you describe the situation of what's happening and why you need to make these choices, their  appreciation for the challenges and the difficulties and the opportunities in agriculture completely<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:46">0:37:46-0:37:58</a>:</strong>  changes.  Yeah, so we don't want to... We want to be careful here. We want to elevate as much as  possible the position of the grower within the whole spectrum of our society and our<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:37:58">0:37:58-0:38:18</a>:</strong>  agriculture. And we want them to be successful. I would say, thinking more about your question,  the single most common source of struggle that I've seen over the years begins with  the grower looking at their product only as a farmer, unable to see it in a more comprehensive<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:18">0:38:18-0:38:35</a>:</strong>  way, but most especially as the buyer sees it. That's what I've observed is attitudes  like, well, if I eat it, everyone else should be able to eat it too. Or if it's acceptable  to me, why isn't it acceptable to you? It's rarely expressed that way, but that's the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:35">0:38:35-0:38:54</a>:</strong>  attitude. And when a grower is able to completely see the product from completely the other  side of the table as the shed their grower, if you will, as much as possible, shed their  grower attitude temporarily and see the product as if they're buying it for how it's going<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:38:54">0:38:54-0:39:12</a>:</strong>  to be used by the buyer, then they're on, I think, a really exciting path to looking  differently at their own farm and possibly being able to exploit market opportunities  that they didn't see before. That's the single most consistent aspect of a vegetable farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:12">0:39:12-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  now, especially a vegetable farm that might be selling directly to consumers or some sort  of buyer, but even those who work, you know, grow for processors.  That's a fascinating observation. I love it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:41</a>:</strong>  They need to see it as the buyer does and unequivocally so, you know, without reservation,  not kicking and screaming, no, welcome the opportunity to see the product as the buyer  does. You will return to being a farmer, no worries. But when you return to being a farmer,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:41">0:39:41-0:39:56</a>:</strong>  hopefully you carry that experience of seeing the product differently with you. And all  of a sudden for some, it'll be like, actually, I'm not producing kale. I'm producing food  that somebody is going to serve at a family function and it's got to be just so, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:39:56">0:39:56-0:40:12</a>:</strong>  they see this kale or they see it as this or that or tomato. We do these exercises with  students in the class, in my class where I hand them a tomato or I hand them a potato  and I say, tell me what you see. And everyone looks at me funny. I'm like, no, tell me what<br />

And we're not, you know, and you'd be amazed by the kinds of words that are used  to describe ordinary products. But in that comes the discussion, okay, now, this is,  now we're on a path towards understanding what that tomato is. And if you give that<br />

And so to a grower, to understand<br />

That's such a fascinating observation. And I, I'm smiling to myself because I'm recalling,  I'm recalling a farm that a colleague of mine worked on a number of years ago. And it was<br />

So they had this,  they had a couple of different lettuce fields that were affected by a major hailstorm within  about eight or 10 days of harvest. And as they were visiting these fields, when they<br />

And what,  what do you think of? And why are you growing lettuce? And the grower's response was, well,<br />

My goal is to have 800 cases per acre. And when I think of it in  my mind's eye, I see it as 800 cases packed in the cooler, ready to ship out so that I  don't want to get a good price for it so that I can be profitable to keep growing this crop<br />

They went to the second field and the second field had very similar  damage, almost the exact same amount of hail damage. And my friend asked the grower, he  said, now, when you, when you think of this field of lettuce, I want you to not think<br />

And so they<br />

And I, I know I'm probably going  out on a limb here quite a bit, but there was this intriguing crop response that when  they, when they evaluated the two fields, the amount of hail damage within, when it<br />

Two crops have been the same variety, planted the same day, but when they went to  harvest, the first field they had, they only had about a 20% harvest because of all the<br />

The second field where the grower had a different mental image of the crop that  he was producing, they had an 80% yield. So, tremendous different, tremendously different  response from the plants in the field. Now, I know this is pretty far out there. Did,<br />

I don't know. I'm not going to suggest that they were, but there definitely was something  majorly different in those two fields. And it was, that observation kind of really caught<br />

Like I keep, that's one of the things that I puzzle over sometimes is just  what really was going on there? What was happening? What did we miss?  So, right. So, I mean, I, clearly I don't claim understanding of much of anything, even<br />

I think a number of very successful companies recognize<br />

It's possible that they took something away simply because they had to,  they didn't have enough, enough time to make another stop, but they won't be back or they're  not overly enthusiastic about what they, what they took away. They took it because they<br />

So they have an internal  control on that day at that time at that point of sale, but do they really have a more comprehensive<br />

Maybe not. That comes with some real,  you know, if you will, sophisticated, but focused attention to what the buyer is actually  looking for. And, you know, more and more of that would help.<br />

Because remember, and, you know, buyers have, you know, especially those  who are chefs, who are reselling the product, produce managers at grocery stores, intermediaries,  if you will, and even some individual consumers, of course, they have aspirations to they,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:06">0:47:06-0:47:23</a>:</strong>  they are hoping we're here on here in this conversation, we're talking about how growers  can grow and adapt. Well, so are other business people, and individuals, they're growing and  adapting. We see evidence of this, you know, quite profoundly, and I can, I can cite one<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:23">0:47:23-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  here in just a moment. But for the grower to be in step with that market, that individual,  that that group, or to, or to even sidestep them, if you will, make a parallel move and  become more informed about another group, I think is only to their advantage. So however,<br />

Now  specific to a specific example, I'm part of a much larger team at Ohio State University<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:47:56">0:47:56-0:48:14</a>:</strong>  that is involved with understanding or working to understand connections between diet and  health, but particularly within the fine community of eaters, if you will, these being cancer  survivors. And these, these are folks that have gone through their primary treatments,<br />

And they are some subset of them are being provided  with access to freshly harvested fruits and vegetables. Okay, they have an entirely different  outlook on diet, having gone through their treatment, their diagnosis and treatment,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:48:34">0:48:34-0:48:50</a>:</strong>  now having a different appreciation for and view on diet health relationships, they have  an entirely different view of what they will buy, and what they will look for. They, and  some of these folks, of course, are midlife and older, they have, and of course, they're<br />

They have family, they have friends. So they, my  point here is that with their newfound or, you know, revitalized appreciation for diet  health connections, and now focus on what they eat, you know, are growers being a partner<br />

Are we doing any, are we taking any steps to connect with people who  have a new interest in food? Or are we going to leave it to chance? Are we going to leave  it to them going into their local store and talking to the produce manager or their restaurant<br />

Is it going to be just chance and the grower will get whatever  comes their way? Or will growers be proactive in that process? And of course, when they're  asked, can you grow a more nutritious product? Be able to say, yes, indeed, I can. And, oh,<br />

Because of course, the dietetics  nutrition and oncology community will have certain expectations of them. It isn't just  like waving hands and saying it's more nutrient dense. No, there are specific bioactive compounds<br />

Will the growers know about those? And will they be able to manage their crop  accordingly? You know, we want to get to this higher plane. Everyone needs to step up their  game. Advisors, scientists, growers, we're all being asked to do more. But in that, there's<br />

So let's actually, I'd love to expand on that thought that you just expressed at the end.  From your perspective, where is the greatest opportunity for growers today? Where's the<br />

Where's the greatest opportunity to move to that next  plateau?  Continue to do what they have done for many years very well, but do it better. We focus<br />

We  focus on the social component. That's very, very important, you know, so-called food equity,  food access, food availability, food security, that aspect of food security. Be a partner<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:20</a>:</strong>  in the process to some level in enhancing the social component of what they do, their  environment. Be connected in some way. Secondly, environmentally. Yes, we ask a lot of growers.  I mean, they have a lot of demands on them. They're supposed to do this, this, and this,<br />

But do one's level best to use the natural resources that are required to produce food  well. Be a good steward of the earth, okay? Probably there will be rewards for that. One<br />

But be a good steward of the natural  resources that are required to produce food. And then finally, as far as the economic piece,  if you will, you know, be a steward of the farm in that and a student of the farm in<br />

Of course, you're trying to run a business. You're trying to be successful at it. You're  trying to have a generated income. And as many steps as can be taken in terms of understanding  the market and enhancing perhaps the price that they get, you know, what would that involve?<br />

But to be familiar with the other or any other, I think, has  become essential. And at least as an investigator, as you know, as an academic, that's kind of  part and parcel of, you know, a career there, because we see how as new data emerge, we<br />

And academics are fairly adept at picking out  folks who are operating with, quote, old thinking. I mean, it's just something you become, you  know, somewhat adept at. They're not up on the current information, so on and so forth.<br />

It's a challenge to remain up to date, but  it's necessary. So I would say for farming, it's the same way. If you are, you know, if  a grower is not aware of some of the newest trends in technology, in what people respond<br />

So some of those, given the types of operations I interact with most often, okay, I would  say there are two sectors that are related. One is grower-friendly technology that can<br />

So we call them sensors, you know,  fire loggers, miniature temperature sensors, ones that will communicate with the grower<br />

But I think it's the analytical capabilities that we're  beginning to implement that will matter to growers going forward.<br />

Obviously, for people who are shipping  all over the country, they're tracking this anyway. They have a hand in that to begin  with.<br />

What is the one question you wish I would have asked? What's the piece  that you would have loved to discuss in this conversation?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=0:58:24">0:58:24-0:58:40</a>:</strong>  Goodness gracious, I've been so focused on what we have been talking about. I, at some  point, if it would be useful, I'd like to return to the question of nutritional value  and so-called nutrient density. It's a term that I call and others have called nutritional<br />

That's a combination of the traditional yield as we measure it, pounds  per acre or what have you, times the nutrient value that it contains and concentration of  this product or that metabolite or another metabolite. That's the metric that we have<br />

Not so much  by the nutritional value, but anticipating a time when the proportion of the price as<br />

In other words, people  value nutrition more highly. I'd like to ask of growers, what are they hearing? What are  they seeing from their customers regarding the role of nutrition or quality, flavor,<br />

I'd like to learn more from them to get a sense for whether or not my  reading of the situation is accurate. I think that we, in order to guide the work going  forward.<br />

I'd love to dig into it a little bit more  deeply. I think that particularly, there's a couple of different questions here. There's  obviously the question of food quality, but also from perhaps a macro perspective of needing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:11">1:00:11-1:00:31</a>:</strong>  to grow better nutrition, or I should say, perhaps say more nutrition for a growing world  population. Should we perhaps also begin measuring crop production in terms of protein content  per acre or carbohydrate production per acre for what will actually be used as a food source?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:31">1:00:31-1:00:44</a>:</strong>  So what are your thoughts?  Some of that is already being done. Perhaps not much is being made of it publicly, but  of course, I call it the composition or the makeup of the major components of the food<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-value-of-nutrient-density-with-matt-kleinhenz/#t=1:00:44">1:00:44-1:01:01</a>:</strong>  supply in the US and Europe and other places, that's tracked. There are federal and state  agencies that do that, that's mostly federal. Federal agencies that do that, that's what  they're tasked to do. So we have some really capable people who are not only involved in<br />

We can model, for example, what  the impact would be if we ate, as a population per capita, if we ate one pound less of meat  per year, what that could mean in any number of ways. Or if the certain parameters, certain<br />

We have some projections that way, and they're very intriguing. I would  say that in as much as a grower would try to build part of their business around that<br />

It's a huge challenge to do much of anything other than produce the crop using ways that  are very familiar and reliable. So to add on to that, wow, you're asking me to become<br />

Just take a few steps forward in that direction to appreciate  and understand where there might be a market opportunity for you to grow the business based  on the quality of the crop and the markets that you're now trying to access. And so be,<br />

I think that's maybe a message that I didn't make very clear and some may have already  picked up on is to whatever extent possible, create the desire, create the market, don't<br />

We're talking about a spectrum that way. So how would I as a grower  work to create the market? How can I shift the perspectives in the market? You'd be informed  as much as you could be with the time that you have and resources you have, you'd be<br />

And<br />

Some can very well be  seen. Color is a prime example of that. If you study up on the dietary recommendations  as drawn by the dietetics, nutrition and human health professional community, not the USDA<br />

And we have in the fruit and vegetable world, we have obviously a huge  palette of color opportunities. So to understand what it might take to provide a deeper red<br />
