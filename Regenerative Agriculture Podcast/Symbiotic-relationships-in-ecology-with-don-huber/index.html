I am passionate about developing regenerative  agriculture systems that improve soil health, produce crops that are completely resistant to  diseases and insects, and produce fruit of such an exceptional quality that we can have a legitimate<br />

I've discovered that there are many people with  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:00:33">0:00:33-0:00:49</a>:</strong>  it's found all over the place. Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  and that hasn't been shared with many people. I started Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006 to<br />

It's my personal mission to have these  regenerative agricultural systems become adopted globally and become the mainstream, the status<br />

To help achieve this goal, I want to  share the knowledge that we have learned in the last decade and make it available to everyone.  While we have developed products at AEA that embody the principles of regenerative agriculture<br />

And when they are applied properly, they will always increase farm profitability  and resilience to climate stress. If you have any questions, suggestions, comments, or ideas,<br />

In this episode, I'm very excited to welcome Don Huber to  our show.

Don, welcome to the show. We're very honored to  have you. Thanks, John. privilege to be here. Don, you've lived a very rich life experience.  What are some of your most memorable moments that led you to where you are today?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:02:52">0:02:52-0:03:15</a>:</strong>  I just have fun wherever I am. There's any any particular time, then a few challenges, but  those help you grow and help you focus on what you really want to do and where you think you can be  a greater service. What was something in your research work that you puzzled over for a<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:15">0:03:15-0:03:35</a>:</strong>  really long time that you struggled to figure out? Well, there have been a number of them. When you  study soil ecology, you're looking at a black box. So the pieces to the puzzle have to come a little  slower than they might for some other programs or other areas. But you start working on the border,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:35">0:03:35-0:03:58</a>:</strong>  and then you start filling in the center. And as that puzzle builds a little better, you get a  little better picture of all of the dynamics that's really involved. And I think that's  been the greatest challenge and the most rewarding to gain some comprehension of what that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:03:59">0:03:59-0:04:19</a>:</strong>  black box really is doing, its dynamic nature and its critical importance  in the overall production stream of things. What has been something that surprised you?  How everything can be working at one time that seems to be contradictory.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:22">0:04:22-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  Can you give me an example of that? Oh, I think you have your, a lot of your nutrient  relationships, where you have microorganisms that are responsible for changing valence states  of various minerals, so they're more available or less available. And you have those going on at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:05:07</a>:</strong>  same, both of those directions going in the same time, and some capacities. So it's kind of a matter  with manganese or iron or some of those things, how some of the secondary or what we would,  what I would consider the more secondary functions come into play, so that all of that can<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:05:07">0:05:07-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  really take place and be manifest in a very positive manner. Even though what you might be  looking at or the tests that you have may not show the complete picture, you have to realize that  it has to be going on in order to complete the cycle. And so it's a matter of either developing<br />

So that you have, everything isn't just one big  pool that's put in there and somebody's stirring the whole thing around. You really have a community<br />

You have each one of those different functions  that is taking place to end their own little scheme of things so that the overall system is<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:24">0:06:24-0:06:46</a>:</strong>  a very functional, very dynamic relationship relative to the plant and its needs.  One of the pieces that you and I have discussed in the past is the challenge that we are seeing  today with manganese availability. One of the, I would say that as much as 80% or more, perhaps<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:06:46">0:06:46-0:07:06</a>:</strong>  even 90% or more of the crops that we work with today often come back showing inadequate levels  of manganese. What are the major factors that are contributing to that? Well, yeah, manganese  availability is a very dynamic relationship with the soil by here. Also with many of the fungi,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:06">0:07:06-0:07:27</a>:</strong>  so that you have organisms, your mycorrhizae and that increase uptake of manganese as well as zinc  and phosphorus and some of the other nutrients so that if they're not functional, you miss that  ability to absorb and to interact with a tremendous volume of the soil where that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:27">0:07:27-0:07:51</a>:</strong>  mineral might be in short supply. The other thing is that you have the bacteria especially that are  responsible for the valence state. You have the oxidizing group, you have the reducing groups,  so that the plant can utilize only the reduced form of manganese, the MN2 plus farm. The MN4<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:07:51">0:07:51-0:08:22</a>:</strong>  plus farm is not available. We see that primarily present in the soil where we have high phosphate  levels or high oxidative relationships so that the manganese can be there and yet not available  for uptake. We see it commonly with many of our pathogens because the pathogens again utilize<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:22">0:08:22-0:08:46</a>:</strong>  manganese oxidation as a virulence factor. When we looked at several thousand isolates of manganese,  we have thrombosis graminis that causes take-all on wheat from all over the world. We evaluated those  and we found that there is one characteristic that is common all of the virulent farms and that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:08:46">0:08:46-0:09:12</a>:</strong>  manganese oxidation. If it can't oxidize manganese, it will never come up with these. The same thing for rice  glass, same thing for isolates of streptomyces, cabies, potato, jabs, pathogen, a number of other  pathogens so that just the ability to oxidize manganese to a non-available farm can compromise<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:12">0:09:12-0:09:36</a>:</strong>  the resistance of the plant to those pathogens and if the pathogens can't bring about that  compromising of the availability of manganese by converting it to an oxidized farm from a reduced farm,  the fungus is essentially just a good sacrifice in the soil and same thing with many bacteria.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:09:36">0:09:36-0:10:03</a>:</strong>  So we see these direct effects on mineral availability as being involved in not just  growth and quality and nutrient density but also in susceptibility or resistance to disease.  You have the virulence relationship of the pathogens, bacteria and fungi in the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:03">0:10:03-0:10:29</a>:</strong>  related to those minerals that are necessary for the plant's defenses and you also see it then  those minerals directly related to growth and resistance of the plant to those pathogens and  its overall physiological function. So it all fits together very nicely if the system is balanced,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:29">0:10:29-0:10:54</a>:</strong>  if it's favorable and that's one of the things that we tend to forget is that when we're farming  we're really managing an ecology. It's not a matter of just this silver bullet for this problem  or silver bullet or stinger missile for another one. It's really a matter of having that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:10:55">0:10:55-0:11:17</a>:</strong>  ecology work for us and support the plant. If we don't do that and we upset that system  then we compromise the overall quality and productivity potential that we have in our soil.  I'd like to go back for a moment and just clarify one of the points that you were discussing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:37</a>:</strong>  You said that there are a number of pathogens that are dependent on manganese oxidation  and if they're unable to oxidize manganese they just become saprophytes in the soil profile.  Does that, are they dependent on that manganese oxidation directly or as in they personally<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:37">0:11:37-0:11:59</a>:</strong>  require it or are they just producing a manganese deficient plant that is now susceptible to  invasion? Both of those statements could be correct. They don't necessarily need the oxidation.  Many of them are also or some of them are also reducing organisms. In other words you<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:11:59">0:11:59-0:12:23</a>:</strong>  change the environment or you change the association that they have with other organisms  and they may be strong reducing versus strong oxidizing organisms. We see that especially with  the pseudomonads and a number of other organisms where you change the soil environment and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:23">0:12:23-0:12:50</a>:</strong>  can either benefit you or be a synergist or even a direct pathogen involved in that by  compromising that resistance. The microorganisms use those minerals just like the plant does  or just like we do. Our metallon nutrients are strong transition elements or electron transfer<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:12:50">0:12:50-0:13:13</a>:</strong>  and physiological processes. They're the key factor, the cofactors for our enzyme function.  It doesn't require very much of them but if you don't have that specific cofactor that's involved  for an enzyme, that enzyme isn't going to do any work for you. Just another protein that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:13">0:13:13-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  sitting there and about 80% of our proteins in plants are what we call metalloproteins.  Well the metallopart is the cofactor. It's a very small part but a very critical part as far as  function of that physiological pathway. In essence what you're describing is that as long as plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:53</a>:</strong>  have adequate availability of reduced manganese you have resistance to all the diseases that you  described. It would be very critical for that resistance for the physiological functions in the  plant without those minerals. One of the pieces that you and I have discussed in the past is the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:13:54">0:13:54-0:14:12</a>:</strong>  populations of some strains of verticillium in the soil profile when you have a crop that is  infected versus a crop that is not infected. How do populations change when you have a crop  infection for some of these pathogens? Well the plant is providing nutrients and resources<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:12">0:14:12-0:14:35</a>:</strong>  for the pathogen. When it comes to verticillium, verticillium is a common soil and  habiting organism rather than just the soil colonizing organism. If it's soil and habiting  it's able to survive in the soil on its own. It really doesn't need the plant necessarily<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:14:35">0:14:35-0:15:00</a>:</strong>  to continue its life cycle in the soil. A soil inhabitant or a soil colonizer is an organism  that as long as there is a host there that provides that nutrient base for it can be very  serious or have a very high population. You'll see most of your Penicillium and Aspergillus species<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:00">0:15:00-0:15:25</a>:</strong>  that you always isolate in very high populations but they're only associated with high organic  matter and those materials that provide a rich nutrient base for them. If you take the organic  matter out of the pitcher, the nutrient base they aren't able to survive very well. Compare that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:25">0:15:25-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  with mucus or Fusarium or Izactonia, Pomatomyces and your regular soil-borne pathogens,  Phytophthora, you'll find that those are going to be in the soil at a similar population regardless  of what you have from a nutrient base as far as whether the plants there are not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:16:16</a>:</strong>  Population of Fusarium may bounce around when you add the plant because you're  providing an additional nutrient source for it but its population is high enough  in almost all situations to cause extreme disease. Even in the absence of the host plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:16">0:16:16-0:16:43</a>:</strong>  you can have a 100% infection if you inoculate sterile soil for instance where if the difference  is where you have a lot of other organisms that will suppress that virulence relationship that  the pathogen has and it is maintained either in a dormant state or it's with some of the fungi,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:16:43">0:16:43-0:17:06</a>:</strong>  some of the fungi we refer to that as fungistasis, are a dormant state just because you have  an intimate association with bacteria or other organisms in association with that fungus  that prevented pathogenicity. It may be those other organisms may be utilizing the extracellular<br />

It's just that they change its ability to cause disease so that it's more<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:28">0:17:28-0:17:50</a>:</strong>  like a fat-refied than it is a strong pathogen. That's absolutely fascinating that we can have  these soil inhabiting pathogens that are present in populations that obviously these populations  can shift but it's intriguing to me that essentially what you're describing is an<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:17:50">0:17:50-0:18:10</a>:</strong>  infection is not the result of the presence of the pathogen, it's the result of the level of plant  health and the result of the microbial ecology in the rhizosphere, essentially what you're describing.  That's correct for the soil-borne pathogens. When it comes to the soil inhabiting<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:10">0:18:10-0:18:36</a>:</strong>  then they're dependent on that both very definitely for a nutrient base and for  a disease relationship. With the soil inhabiting we see a dramatic effect of crop rotation  linked between susceptible crops and those things. We can see it also with the soil, we see that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:36">0:18:36-0:18:58</a>:</strong>  relationship with the soil inhabiting not because of presence or absence of the pathogen but  by the specific interrelationships that we have with different organisms with the pathogen,  with the soil colonizing where they can, an organism can colonize as long as there's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:18:58">0:18:58-0:19:23</a>:</strong>  nutrient source part or organic materials part to get that nutrient source from.  Those are more direct effects of where you see population dynamics and the typical  epidemiological programs or processes going on in the soil where with the actual soil colonizers<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:19:23">0:19:23-0:20:00</a>:</strong>  you see the interaction of other organisms in that disease suppression. I think an example of  the soil inhabitant versus a soil colonizer would be a fusarium Rhizoctonia,  Verstilium, those organisms, the soil organisms that would respond to population dynamics<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:00">0:20:00-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  would be your nematodes for one but also things like anthracnose or other organisms that once  the nutrient source, the host's residue is decomposed and pretty much gone the pathogen  isn't able to survive in the soil against the tremendous biological buffering and interactions<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:43</a>:</strong>  that take place in a normal soil. What are the tools that growers have available to them to  manage soil ecology most effectively and to develop a disease suppressive soil profile?  What are the most effective management strategies for managing soil ecology?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:20:43">0:20:43-0:21:06</a>:</strong>  Well from a dynamic standpoint crop rotation has the greatest effect. Again that's going  to depend on the particular pathogen that's involved but each crop manages or influences  a certain group of organisms in the soil and those then are going to enter into that relationship.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:06">0:21:06-0:21:29</a>:</strong>  So what we found with alfalfa when it was introduced as a crop it was a total failure for  us for about two years until we recognized the importance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and  we started adding the human oculents then in order to have that free nitrogen that made an economic<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:29">0:21:29-0:21:54</a>:</strong>  crop for us. Without that we were having to add nitrogen and another mineral but with that  symbiotic relationship we get for nothing or we get for free essentially by having those  organisms fix atmospheric nitrogen into amino acids for the plant to utilize. So that would be<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:21:54">0:21:54-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  an example of that symbiotic relationship just from a nutrient standpoint. But crop rotation  will influence each group of organisms so that it makes it very easy if we're developing  a desert soil to build up disease suppressiveness and we can do that strictly by the crop sequence<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:41</a>:</strong>  that we have to build a biological buffering capacity in the soil in a desert condition  because those soils have very low microbial population and activity to start with because  of the lack of water. When you get a cultivated soil it becomes much more difficult to shift that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:22:41">0:22:41-0:23:04</a>:</strong>  biology in the direction that you want and for some pathogens we've never been able to  find a crop rotation that will do that but for most of them we can modify the diseases  expression even independent of population of the pathogen by favoring certain other groups of<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:04">0:23:04-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  organisms in that relationship. But crop rotation would be the first probably the most dynamic  effect then on the soil population. We can do that either primarily through crop sequencing  you'll find that the immediately preceding crop to your target crop that you're working on<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:51</a>:</strong>  is going to have about 85% of the overall disease effect on it.  We can accomplish that with cover cropping. You don't necessarily have to  eliminate your economic crop with cover cropping. We can do much the same type of thing as well as<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:23:51">0:23:51-0:24:13</a>:</strong>  get some additional synergy from a nutrient standpoint. When you look at how to manage  that soil we're looking at the influence of root exudates and the influence of a particular  crop, what it leaves in the soil, how it influences nutrients that then are available to the pathogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:13">0:24:13-0:24:39</a>:</strong>  also are the other saprophytic organisms that would influence that soil ecology.  Certainly tillage has a very dynamic effect. Time of tillage is very important especially in the  temperate climates. A little different in the tropical and arctic environments but<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:24:39">0:24:39-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  arctic and temperate, your tillage has a time of tillage becomes very important because  what you're doing is disrupting an ecology that's established in a no-till situation  and you're trying to activate or suppress different organisms that have established<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:25</a>:</strong>  a king of the hill relationship with the system that you have.  Tillage changes that overall ecology by getting some air into the soil, getting nutrient distribution  and stirring up those organisms that some of them are kind of like we are. If they don't have a burr<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:25">0:25:25-0:25:51</a>:</strong>  under their saddle they don't do much work for us and so you're stirring them up. In the temperate  environment where we have winter seasons and summer seasons and whatnot, you'll find that  with fall tillage after your crop, if you'll do the tillage then you'll see a more pronounced<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:25:51">0:25:51-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  or a more dynamic relationship than you'll see with the spring tillage. In fall tillage you  open up the soil, it becomes very oxidative for organisms to have that fresh charge of breath  and then over winter you re-establish those ecological niches so that your anaerobic<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:41</a>:</strong>  functions can take place and still have your aerobic functions taking place. So your reduction  of nutrient farm or your oxidation of nutrient farm. Then our rebalance in the spring when we do  a lot of tillage, you don't have time during that immediately or crop that immediately follows your<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:26:41">0:26:41-0:27:04</a>:</strong>  tillage operation. There's not time to re-establish a lot of those ecological niches that take some  time and so you get a different effect and it can be a more negative effect, it may be a more  positive effect again depending on your crop and your overall disease organism or overall nutrient<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:04">0:27:04-0:27:27</a>:</strong>  status that you're dealing with in a particular soil whether it's a clay or clay loam or silt loam  soil versus the sandy loam soil. You see those ecological relationships shifting or changing  in a dynamic relationship relative to time. Moisture becomes a very important factor for<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:52</a>:</strong>  changing those ecological relationships and pretty much anything we do management wise  is going to influence that soil ecology. That's why farming we're really managing an ecology  and by learning what your soil is, what your biology is, you can pretty much control most<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:27:52">0:27:52-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  of our diseases through that management activity unless you're doing something that is very  detrimental or has long-term effects on biology. That's a very impressive statement. We can manage  disease and pathogenicity based on how we manage our soils from a cultural perspective. That's<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:33</a>:</strong>  a very important perspective that I think we don't commonly hear in agriculture. You  mentioned a number of different pieces, a number of different management tools, cultural management  tools, crop rotations, using cover crops, tillage, the impact of moisture and I wanted to clarify<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:33">0:28:33-0:28:54</a>:</strong>  earlier you spoke of the differences between soil borne pathogens and soil inhabiting pathogens.  I believe it's fairly well understood that we can use crop rotations and so forth to manage  soil inhabiting pathogens. Are you suggesting that it's also possible to use these tools to manage<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:28:54">0:28:54-0:29:17</a>:</strong>  and suppress soil inhabiting or excuse me soil borne pathogens? Oh very definitely.  Most of our soil borne pathogens we have very limited genetic resistance as far as  a full resistance. We rely on those management techniques to control those pathogens. Sometimes<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:17">0:29:17-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  we don't recognize it as much as we need to but soil borne pathogens have much more limited  relationship as far as the population dynamics. We may measure population of spore load and other  things for organisms like Fusarium but the population, the organism is there in plenty<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:29:44">0:29:44-0:30:08</a>:</strong>  and a high enough population that regardless of what we do, if we didn't have the other organisms  associated with it, it would take our crop. What we do with our soil colonizing is that they  colonize only as long as they have a nutrient base to function with so that we can either extend our<br />

Same thing with anthracnose on corn that it's a soil colonizer cephalosporium<br />

All of those organisms survive in the residue. Many of them even produced an antibiotic  so that they slow down residue degradation to extend their lifetime in the soil  and that so that other organisms aren't able to colonize that food base which is quite different<br />

Many of the bacilliomycetite pathogens are very excellent  soil inhabitants. They don't require the base of nutrients that many of our  many of our just colonizers do.<br />

Again that's going to depend on your disease and your overall soil biology but you'll find  for instance if you're dealing with take all, you'll minimize these contaminants, the root<br />

Perhaps the best crop overall is oats, another cereal crop but with oats we bred  into those when we bred crown rust resistance it also gave us an oak crop that provided<br />

The reason is that  crown rust resistant oats also produce a glycosyanide root exudate that suppresses the  manganese oxidizing organisms. When you suppress the manganese oxidizing organisms, it also<br />

So you've increased the manganese availability for the plant for its own resistance and the  shikimate pathway is the pathway that gives the tolerance or resistance to take all because<br />

I have a plant like rye, very efficient in manganese<br />

Rye takes care of itself so that it's quite resistant to  the take-all pathogen but it doesn't do anything for a subsequent crop, it barely does very well  with very little disease pressure because it's very efficient in taking up manganese and other<br />

If you have triticale which is a wheat rye cross, if it doesn't contain that sharp  section of the rye chromosome that is responsible for micronutrient uptake then the triticale will  be as susceptible to take-all as the wheat crop that parity. So that it goes that way but it<br />

With oats, with the root exudate that is a very strong antimicrobial  compound against the manganese oxidizing organisms that make manganese less available,<br />

So it's not just<br />

So you're  changing the dynamics of the system or the particular management tools that you might be using.  When you speak of the disease suppressive effects of oats and brassicas, what are the key<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:36:58">0:36:58-0:37:14</a>:</strong>  characteristics that they share in common that perhaps are also shared by other disease suppressive  crops? And I'm asking this question just I think it would be wonderful for our listeners to have  an idea of what are the various crop types or what are the characteristics that they can use<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:14">0:37:14-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  to help develop a disease suppressive soil? Many of those are worked out and you know just from  empirical information but it all boils down pretty much to nutrition one way or another. It may be  indirect through that antibiotic effect through the root exudate on a particular group of organisms<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:58</a>:</strong>  or it may be a direct effect on increasing the availability of a specific nutrient. I mentioned  the take-all situation with manganese, you'll see the same relationship of manganese with  potato scab and with verticillium wilt. A little different involvement in the physiology with<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:37:58">0:37:58-0:38:18</a>:</strong>  verticillium wilt where you have a vascular pathogen versus a cortical pathogen but it's again  the availability of that nutrient or the non-availability that determines what the  disease severity really is. We're concerned in bananas for the loss of the cavendish banana<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:18">0:38:18-0:38:42</a>:</strong>  because of a resurgence in Panama disease, cusarium cubans and yet that pathogen has always been  there. What we've done is change the management and the soil ecology then that provide an  opportunity for that pathogen to become more virulent and to manifest itself. We've changed<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:38:42">0:38:42-0:39:06</a>:</strong>  it from a saprophytic organism essentially into a very virulent pathogen and haven't recognized  what those changes are usually that are involved in that shift. This situation with the cavendish,  you have a tie-up of zinc and again the involvement of very strong mineral chelators<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:06">0:39:06-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  that we're using in our chemical agriculture. You spoke of the effects of tillage on developing  different microbial profiles and I wanted to clarify that. Are you suggesting that with all  tillage applications that we get a rebalancing effect of both reducing organisms as well as<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  oxidizing organisms? We do and it depends. It doesn't have to be every year but there's some  changes that take place with long-term no-till that reduce the efficiency of the ecology.  For nitrogen especially, you'll have over 10 full greater nitrogen reduction denitrification<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:40:19</a>:</strong>  and no-till than you have in a conventional tillage. Even though in conventional tillage we  would have more oxidative environment, you'd think it'd be the opposite but it isn't because  denitrification is an anaerobic process and so if there's any way for that nitrogen to be converted<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  nitrate nitrogen in a no-till situation that's going to be very rapidly converted to  elemental nitrogen and move back into the air. You'll see all your nitrogen  like nitro-toxides and those materials then that are evolved from no-till much more extensively<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  than they are from a conventional. So it's a balancing situation and managing any ecology.  And there are several studies that have shown with long-term tillage conservation tillage and  some of those things but or you haven't had any real soil disruption for eight or ten years that<br />

You don't have to  do that every year, you don't have to beat your soil to death in order to get those effects.  It's a matter of getting enough shift in that soil biology, enough activity, and that we get<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:23">0:41:23-0:41:42</a>:</strong>  the desired result from a nutrient standpoint. What are the impacts of nitrogen and nitrogen  applications on developing disease-suppressive soils? Most of your soil organisms are hungry for  two things. One of them is going to be nitrogen, the other one is going to be carbon. But when you<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:41:42">0:41:42-0:42:04</a>:</strong>  change either of those nutrients you'll see a tremendous stimulation of a lot of organisms  in the soil. Depending on what your source of nitrogen is, you get down into Florida and they're  one of their primary pathogens on a lot of their crops, vegetable crops, is Fusarium<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:04">0:42:04-0:42:26</a>:</strong>  autismim. So if this is a vascular Fusarium, they can get pretty much complete practical control by  using nitrate, nitrogen, and calcium. So if they can stimulate nitrification or if they apply  nitrate, nitrogen, calcium nitrate or calcium nitrate, and also have to use some liming to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:26">0:42:26-0:42:53</a>:</strong>  their pH up so that you have that nitrogen held in the nitrogen form, you have a fairly effective  control of Fusarium wilt diseases. If you are looking at tobacco where we would use fumigation  for control of some of the soil borne diseases, you should have at least 30% of your nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:42:53">0:42:53-0:43:16</a>:</strong>  is nitrate and nitrogen. If you don't, the plant is taking up all ammonium nitrogen, you can get  into a carbon deficit because the plant will detoxifies the nitrate or the ammonium nitrogen  by combining with photosynthate and carbon from photosynthesis that provides the carbon base for<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:16">0:43:16-0:43:39</a>:</strong>  those amino acids and then the nitrogen is translocated as the amino acid. If you don't have  enough nitrate and nitrogen present, you buffer against that high ammonium source that you're  going to get a fumigation because our soil fumigants tend to knock out nitrifying organisms<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:43:39">0:43:39-0:44:05</a>:</strong>  so that you don't get nitrification there. It stabilizes it in the ammonium form but it can  actually be drained on the carbon on the energy availability then until that ammonium is  detoxified and utilized by the plant. So there are changes that take place and that overall function.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:07">0:44:07-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  That answered your question. I'm thinking about what you've described about how many of the  soil borne pathogens, soil borne fungi such as bussarium and verticillium for example,  are dependent on oxidizing manganese and limiting manganese absorption by the plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:48</a>:</strong>  If that were the case, what would be the impact of adding ammonium to such an ecosystem where  you have a reduced form of nitrogen? What would the impact of the ammonium be on these  soil borne pathogens? On that group of pathogens, you'll see a tremendous reduction in disease.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:44:48">0:44:48-0:45:10</a>:</strong>  That's with the ammonium nutrition. I have a chapter in one of the annual reviews just on  the impact of the form of nitrogen. You'll see a tremendous benefit with different organisms  by just selection of the form of nitrogen that that plant is going to be predominantly supplied<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:10">0:45:10-0:45:33</a>:</strong>  with. You may not have to provide the form of nitrogen if you modify the environment so that  those soil microorganisms make those conversions. You'll see that the change that then that form of  nitrogen will be available for the plant. So it's important that you have both the management tools<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:33">0:45:33-0:45:57</a>:</strong>  as well as the farm. Most of our soils, nitrification takes place very rapidly.  So you need to do something to inhibit nitrification. We can do it biologically.  There to modify the speed of that reaction so we can increase the amount of nitrogen that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:45:57">0:45:57-0:46:19</a>:</strong>  we use nitrate or ammonium. But when it's taking up ammonium nitrogen, you have a reducing  environment. That reducing environment is favoring your manganese reducing organisms so that  you'll almost always have an increase in manganese availability for the plant when you use a<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:19">0:46:19-0:46:43</a>:</strong>  predominantly ammonium form of nitrogen. The more rapid oxidative farm when you're using  source of nitrogen. What is the impact of carbon to nitrogen ratios on both disease  suppressive soil and also on yield? Carbon nitrogen ratio again depends on the carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:46:43">0:46:43-0:47:05</a>:</strong>  source. That got me into trouble with my first publication in plant pathology. I challenged  the carbon nitrogen ratio hypothesis where they were saying that if you have this ratio,  a 12 to 1 ratio versus a 40 to 1, you always have this disease relationship. And I demonstrated<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:05">0:47:05-0:47:29</a>:</strong>  that it's not the carbon to nitrogen ratio, it's the form of nitrogen that is involved in that  ratio. So you can take different crop residues or different cropping sequences and it's the effect  of that sequence on the form of nitrogen that determines what the disease reaction is. And of<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:29">0:47:29-0:47:56</a>:</strong>  course the effect of that form of nitrogen quite often is an effect on manganese or zinc or copper  or other nutrients along with the form of nitrogen. But carbon nitrogen ratio works if  you're working with the same nutrient source or crop residue and then vary the nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:47:56">0:47:56-0:48:22</a>:</strong>  ratios by either harvesting it when it's greener or harvesting it when it's drier when you have  wider carbon nitrogen ratio. But the carbon nitrogen ratio per se isn't the factor that's  involved there. It's the effect of that ratio on the form of nitrogen and the minerals,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:22">0:48:22-0:48:46</a>:</strong>  other minerals that are involved such as your manganese or zinc or iron or copper that are all  critical for particular physiological processes. Don, one of the big pieces that I believe is quite  important that we haven't spoken about is the just the general impact of photosynthesis and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:48:46">0:48:46-0:49:07</a>:</strong>  quality of photosynthesis or perhaps I should say the quality is what would perhaps really the  quantity of photosynthesis that can vary in crops and in cover crops and how that  influences the volume of root exudates. How can a grower, how can we increase the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:07">0:49:07-0:49:26</a>:</strong>  quantity of photosynthesis and increase the quantity of root exudates in the soil profile?  Of course, you're not going to have any photosynthesis if you don't have manganese.  Manganese is critical for splitting the water, you provide the hydrogen and then to combine with<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:26">0:49:26-0:49:43</a>:</strong>  carbon dioxide. You're not going to have any photosynthesis without magnesium as part of the  chlorophyll molecule. You're not going to have very efficient photosynthesis without iron and sulfur  and all of your other minerals because your physiology is all tied together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:49:43">0:49:43-0:50:05</a>:</strong>  And if you want to improve the efficiency of photosynthesis, first place to look is going  to be your mineral availability. Having that system work so that you don't have a backlog of  sugar as fructose or glucose. You want that sugar to be stored as sucrose.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:06">0:50:06-0:50:26</a>:</strong>  Changes the osmotic relationship, changes the overall physiology of the plant.  It can be converted then all the way to sucrose. Well, you're also not going to have any sucrose  if you don't have manganese because it's responsible for your sucrose phosphate<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:26">0:50:26-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  synthase enzyme as a cofactor. But it's a system that works together. You don't have sulfur,  you don't have enzymes because most of your proteins are initiated with either cysteine  or methionine, your sulfur amino acids. And again, your C4 plants have a more efficient photosynthetic<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:51:16</a>:</strong>  pathway. They have peptorboxylase as well as the rubisco enzyme to capture that carbon dioxide  from the air and combine it with the hydrogen that is split off the water by manganese. So you have  C4 plants, C3 plants and the physiology that's involved. But all of them require the mineral<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:16">0:51:16-0:51:44</a>:</strong>  nutrients for our fish. And any one of those deficiencies influences the overall efficiency  of the whole process. In the research work that we have done in the field looking at various crops,  I have suggested that what we have come to accept as common or normal, I suppose depending on how<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:51:44">0:51:44-0:52:02</a>:</strong>  you define normal, are crops that are photosynthesizing at only a fraction of their  inherent capacity, perhaps as little as 20 to 25% in a few cases, perhaps even less than that.  What are your thoughts? Do you see the possibility for plants to increase photosynthesis<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:02">0:52:02-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  volume much more than what we normally anticipate?  Well, we're only touching the tip of the iceberg as far as what the potential of that plant is.  And probably the most limiting factor is carbon dioxide. If you increase carbon dioxide, if we would<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:21">0:52:21-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  just increase it a small amount, you'll have an exponential increase in the amount of photosynthesis,  which then gives us the oxygen that we need. So that, again, the systems tie together.  If we limit carbon dioxide, we limit the amount of oxygen that is available for our growth and our use<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:52:45">0:52:45-0:53:13</a>:</strong>  also. But there are many things we can vary the structure, the morphology of the plant from a  leaf standpoint to capture the sunlight more efficiently. It doesn't do much good to do that  if we don't have the carbon dioxide available. And on a corn plant, for instance, 250 bushel<br />

But if we have a sterile  soil, we don't have respiration going on in the soil and utilization of that organic matter that  we're applying to the soil so that we can get that respiration and carbon dioxide. We compromise the<br />

Well, organic matter is great in the soil, we want to<br />

But if it's just sitting there as straw or a stubble, not  decomposing as we see in some of these corn fields, where all of the residues just sitting there  tear up your tractor tires, it's not doing us very much good from a production standpoint. We want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:16">0:54:16-0:54:41</a>:</strong>  have it breaking down, we want to form the humates, the phobic acids and those materials that give us  that overall ecology in the soil that give us crop production. And one of the pieces that I have said,  which really captures people's attention is one of the important reasons to have soil organic matter<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:54:41">0:54:41-0:55:06</a>:</strong>  is so that we can lose it so that we gain. That's correct. We're still limited on carbon dioxide.  And our C4 plants are so efficient, and yet we're not tapping into that efficiency on the plants  because we limit our carbon dioxide. Again, like you say, if it's not working for us,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:06">0:55:06-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  it's really working against us. When we look at the horticultural space,  indoor greenhouse production, when we increase the CO2 levels to 1100 parts per million,  that increase with the exact same lighting, exact same environmental conditions produces about double<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:29">0:55:29-0:55:46</a>:</strong>  the plant biomass just because of increased photosynthesis. That's correct. Our limiting  factor in many of these situations is carbon dioxide, our most limiting mineral.  So what is the potential for plants to increase the volume of photosynthesis?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:55:46">0:55:46-0:56:12</a>:</strong>  Oh, the potential is 100%. I mean, fivefold, tenfold, depending on where we are now and what  the plant is. There are a number of different ways to do that. Again, I mentioned plant morphology,  but you can also do it with increasing light intensity. You've got a lot of leaves on a<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:12">0:56:12-0:56:35</a>:</strong>  corn plant, a mature corn plant or a corn plant at tasseling time that aren't getting very much  sunlight, not photosynthesizing near what their potential would be because of that lack of  sunlight. That's where morphology comes in. But plant spacing, we can increase the number of<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:56:35">0:56:35-0:57:00</a>:</strong>  years on a corn plant. You look at the tremendous work that Gary Ohal is doing at Purdue, for  instance, as a corn breeder, corn geneticist, five and six years on a corn plant, so that  you increase the efficiency of that plant. And you don't need as high a population so that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:00">0:57:00-0:57:23</a>:</strong>  can minimize that crowding and that shading type effect. There are just a number of ways that we  can do that. We can reduce the allelopathic effect of our plants when they're to increase  the population. And corn, very critical that you have even germination. If you delay germination<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:24">0:57:24-0:57:48</a>:</strong>  six to eight days, you automatically reduce the size of your ear by the allelopathic effect,  that auto-intoxication effect of the root exudates on an adjacent plant by as much as 80%.  Wow. When the John Deere Max-emerge planter came out, I remember how it was almost an instant<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:57:48">0:57:48-0:58:13</a>:</strong>  success because it increased the soil feed interface, that contact that gave you that  or uniform emergence. And so you minimize that allelopathic auto-intoxication suppression that  you had otherwise from those higher populations. We could increase our population and maintain that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:13">0:58:13-0:58:33</a>:</strong>  full yield potential without having the allelopathic chemicals reducing the overall  production potential of that particular plant. You know, there are just a number of things we  could do if we needed to. Right now we're concerned about a surplus and maintaining market<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:35">0:58:35-0:58:55</a>:</strong>  on those things. The biggest thing is that necessity is still the mother of invention,  but there's plenty of potential there. When a group of us that in our team programs that we had  at Purdue University, a lot of us had the privilege of working in and one of our huddle sessions or<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:58:55">0:58:55-0:59:16</a>:</strong>  brainstorming sessions, we asked Charles Fye what the genetic potential, the biochemical genetic  potential of a corn plant was. And he said, oh, let me work on it for a little while. And a couple  of weeks later when we were all together, he said, I've got your answer. And we were shooting for<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:16">0:59:16-0:59:41</a>:</strong>  350, 400 bushel. We knew that a lot of our better farmers, this would be back in the late 70s,  a lot of our better farmers had the potential for 550 or even 600 bushel that we were trying  to design some systems for them to achieve that on a field basis. And Charles sat down and we said,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=0:59:41">0:59:41-1:00:06</a>:</strong>  welcome, is this 600 bushel really a realistic figure? And he said, oh, you're all pessimists.  Biochemical genetics of that plant are about 1100 bushel. And so you see what we could do  if we manage that environment and the plant in a proper manner and provided the expression.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:06">1:00:06-1:00:29</a>:</strong>  We probably won't come close to achieving that until the necessity is there. Probably the most  limiting factor that we have to achieve that is the innovation of man. And you see, as long as  we're doing okay, we don't have that burr under our saddle that would have us look at both the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:29">1:00:29-1:00:49</a>:</strong>  genetics as well as the environment to get an expression of that genetic material. So what  yields did you end up achieving on your field trials that you were conducting? We could get  400 bushel. You had farmers that were getting, that was the time with Herman Warsaw and the group<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:00:49">1:00:49-1:01:12</a>:</strong>  that were 350, where the average was still 75 bushel. They were doing three or four or five  times what the average was on a measured piece of land. They were doing it because they recognized  that it's an ecology that we're managing. And they started out with the soil, had a beautiful soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:12">1:01:12-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  I remember visiting Herman Warsaw's farm and you could take a steel probe and you didn't have to  lean on it. You just pushed it in the soil three feet. He had that system working for him very well.  You get into some of the other neighbors and try and push that. You get it down three or four<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:37">1:01:37-1:01:54</a>:</strong>  inch tubes and then you had to really put some pressure on it. You get it down a foot and a half  and you're driving it in. I can't tell you how many of the old king tubes are still sitting  out there in the field. Those were tubes that you could drive into the soil,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:01:54">1:01:54-1:02:15</a>:</strong>  like the soil sample at three and four feet. In order to get it in a lot of our soils,  you're using a sledgehammer. Then the problem was pulling it out. You would tear the metal off  of the tube with the jack and finally you just crimped it over so that it wouldn't tear up the tire<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:15">1:02:15-1:02:37</a>:</strong>  and you left it there. There are a lot of them still sitting out there in those fields because  we didn't have that concept or the soil wasn't a major part of the management program.  We in general would look at the nutrients and forget that all of that's part of an ecology that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:37">1:02:37-1:02:56</a>:</strong>  needs to be managed so that you have water percolation, you have your biology, your air  exchange and those things have to take place if you want to capitalize on the genetic potential  of the plant. What was the amount of plant populations that growers were using to achieve<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:02:56">1:02:56-1:03:19</a>:</strong>  350 plus portals per acre? You had the old Pioneer 3532, I think it was, hybrid that  took up 95% of its nitrogen by tasseling time and then it merely recycled it.  So get on to sandy soils, it was a great hybrid because you couldn't maintain your nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:19">1:03:19-1:03:40</a>:</strong>  availability in those sands and it would take it up and store it. But it had a yield potential of  about 125 bushel at 24,000 plants, which was our standard at the time. But you could increase the  population of that particular variety because it didn't have the allelopathic effects from the root<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:03:40">1:03:40-1:04:02</a>:</strong>  exudates with high populations. It had a fixed year, so as you increase the population you still  maintain that same year length, it wasn't a big year like your yield hybrid, but it was very  stable and it tolerated high populations so they got the yield up by increasing population.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:02">1:04:02-1:04:25</a>:</strong>  With our other varieties, our high yielding varieties, they're hybrids, there you had a more  of a flex there that related to the environment more dynamically and the higher the yield  potential the more nitrogen you want as ammonia. With the 3532 50-50 ratio of ammonia was optimum<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:25">1:04:25-1:04:49</a>:</strong>  for us. When you get into the higher yield and 250 300 bushel yields you want 75 to 80 percent  of your nitrogen as ammonium and only 10 to 20 percent as the nitrate source of nitrogen because  you want all of the photosynthesis that you can to go into the kernel. And if you have, when the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:04:49">1:04:49-1:05:10</a>:</strong>  plant utilizes nitrate nitrogen and most plants can utilize either farm equally well, but it takes  15 to 20 percent of your photosynthate to reduce nitrate nitrogen back to the amine farm so that  the plant can utilize it. And so the higher your yield potential the more ammonium nitrogen you<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:10">1:05:10-1:05:32</a>:</strong>  want to provide that those amino acids for that growth and your enzymes and everything and the  least nitrate nitrogen. We always found that there was a benefit to some nitrate nitrogen because it  serves as a buffer both to limit the drain on carbohydrate if you have a high uptake of ammonium<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:32">1:05:32-1:05:53</a>:</strong>  nitrogen. Nitrate will tend to balance that suppressant down a little bit and but also as a  stable form of nitrogen if you run short then you can use some of that photosynthate. If you have  molybdenum and you have your other nutrients that are available to have are the function of your<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:05:53">1:05:53-1:06:16</a>:</strong>  nitrate nitrite reductase enzyme. Again you have a different physiological pathway and sometimes if  you're just saying well I'm going to get most of mine from an aminoidal source you may forget that  you also have to have molybdenum for some of those other enzymes that aren't quite as dynamic or<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:16">1:06:16-1:06:41</a>:</strong>  quite as involved as they are if you're relying more on the nitrate source. But those are some  of the things you could do to enhance that overall photosynthetic efficiency by just linking a farm  of nitrogen that's going to also influence your soil biology and your buffering capacity in<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:06:41">1:06:41-1:07:06</a>:</strong>  in those areas. So Don it's 1979 you're producing 350 plus bushels of corn per acre in a biological  or in a biological soil ecosystem. Today it's 2017 and growers are struggling to produce 250 bushel  corn. We don't even have a conversation about growing 350 bushel corn on a commercial field<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:06">1:07:06-1:07:25</a>:</strong>  scale. There are a few notable exceptions but not on a large scale production system across the  board. What happened with that knowledge? Where did it go or why? Let me ask the question a little  bit differently. Why was it not adopted on a much broader scale? We started saying we have too much<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:25">1:07:25-1:07:47</a>:</strong>  production. We need to focus in different areas. Our land grant universities that were established  a lot of that research and especially for your long-term commitments that a breeding program  requires for each suppression of that genetic potential. Those programs were closed out and<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:07:47">1:07:47-1:08:08</a>:</strong>  materials were just given to the private companies to develop your experiment stations. We're happy  to not have that long-term commitment. They could then respond to the political pressures and your  program started being limited to three to five years through the competitive grants programs on<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:08">1:08:08-1:08:32</a>:</strong>  a federal scale and most of our breeding programs were funded through the Hatch program, Smith-Lever  program that would give the states a constant amount of money on a formula basis for those  long-term agricultural developments that are the reason why we have the success in our agricultural<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:32">1:08:32-1:08:55</a>:</strong>  programs today or build on those long-term continuous programs that were pretty much  abandoned as we started looking at the bells and whistles in science rather than looking at the  end product that we desired. Again we were producing more than we knew what to do with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:08:55">1:08:55-1:09:18</a>:</strong>  I don't know what we'd do with all the corn that we currently produce if we weren't producing  so much alcohol. That's the way to use your crop, find a new market for it. Certainly population  growth is a long way from requiring what our current production is and as Paul Wagner and his<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:18">1:09:18-1:09:42</a>:</strong>  cash bulletin and with the group that he had he worked with showed that we could produce enough  food for about 15 billion people with about 30 percent less land if we wanted to really do that,  really needed to do that with the technology that we had in 1964. But like you say we were<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:09:42">1:09:42-1:10:08</a>:</strong>  shooting for 400 bushel in 1980, 79 and 1980 and now we're struggling with 250 bushel but  sometimes you have to reinvent the wheel because that part of the system was not considered  important and the resources were transferred. In a breeding program you don't just turn it on and off<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:09">1:10:09-1:10:31</a>:</strong>  with each little whim or political idea that comes along. It's a long-term program.  When we turned all of that material over to the private companies, their interest was the bottom  line. So there's a tremendous amount of material that could be manipulated but as far as that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:31">1:10:31-1:10:55</a>:</strong>  long-term commitment there hasn't been any of that. Genetic engineering has certainly not improved the  long-term effect because you get the idea that we can do it all in a laboratory by just switching  this system on or inhibiting this particular system. We forget that it's still a system,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:10:55">1:10:55-1:11:20</a>:</strong>  an ecology that has to be managed if any of that's going to be of any value to it. And it's a thought  process that's involved as well as the necessity but also the desire, the innovation drops out  when you forget that you're a part of a very dynamic beautiful system that was all put<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:20">1:11:20-1:11:44</a>:</strong>  together and you start only focusing on one thing and silver bullets and forget that silver bullets  may take care of environment but they don't provide stability in the system.  Yeah. Don, what is something you believe to be true about modern agriculture that many other people don't believe to be true?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:11:44">1:11:44-1:12:09</a>:</strong>  I don't know. I think everything I believe to be true is there are a lot of people that feel the  same way. They may not be quite as outspoken as I've been. I think again when you focus  on just one item and forget all of these systems work together you automatically compromise your<br />

We're making plenty of them now I think. Maybe that's part of the gray hair that I carry  around with me that gives me that. I also see a lot of light at the end of the tunnel.<br />

I think your program is an excellent  program. You're successful in communicating a lot of the importance of managing the system  rather than just looking at the bottom line that happens to look very fascinating to us right now<br />

Looking at and putting it in perspective is what we need to do and I  see some young people that are able to express that a lot better than I am. You're one of those  that I admire, have a great deal of confidence in the ability of you to get that job done.<br />

That wasn't my father's decision but that was my concept of what that hoe should  be.

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:31">1:16:31-1:16:53</a>:</strong>  at the recent elections you see the change in the German government that took place,  but a surprising change for many people took place because of agriculture and you can go through  history and show how important agriculture is. It's the basic infrastructure of any society<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:16:53">1:16:53-1:17:14</a>:</strong>  and when we file it up there are consequences and it requires a correction in that manner and  I think we're seeing the pendulum swinging now so we're recognizing the need for nutrient density,  the need to eliminate a lot of the exposure that we have to the glyphosate and some of the other<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:15">1:17:15-1:17:35</a>:</strong>  chemicals that have been accumulating in our environment and in our food supply.  So I see that pendulum swinging. I think it's going to, we'll see those changes taking place  not as fast as I'd like to see but they're coming and I don't move very fast either so<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:35">1:17:35-1:17:58</a>:</strong>  I can't necessarily complain in those processes. It's critical that we recognize our stewardship  that we have when it comes to the soil and to our own survivability in these areas rather than just  accepting the changes that have occurred and say well there's nothing we can do about it now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:17:58">1:17:58-1:18:18</a>:</strong>  Well there's a tremendous amount and matter again understanding that we're managing inequality,  that we're a part of that and great opportunities for us to do things better.  Yeah Don what are some books or some resources that you would recommend to growers<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:19">1:18:19-1:18:34</a>:</strong>  they want to learn more?  Well you have the Phytopath Society under the direction of Lawrence Dattinoff,  kind of provided the nudge to keep us going and that burned our saddle but<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:34">1:18:34-1:18:52</a>:</strong>  you have a number of resources and American Phytopath published the green book on  Mineral Nutrition and Plant Disease. If you're interested in the relationships there I think  that's a good book. I'll plug it I'm one of the editors on it I don't get compensation for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:18:53">1:18:53-1:19:13</a>:</strong>  You have Marschner's book certainly is probably the bible in Plant Nutrition on Mineral Nutrition  of Fire Plant. It's a little detailed or a little deeper than a lot of people want to go.  You have a lot of the older books the Albrecht system you have they're just just a number of<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:13">1:19:13-1:19:34</a>:</strong>  resources if a person really wants to make the changes. You have your programs that you're  working up you're able to communicate with the growers. I think you see eight or ten different  systems now looking at nutrient density. How do we measure it? How do we define it? But at least<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:34">1:19:34-1:19:56</a>:</strong>  getting a lot of that background information that's necessary for us to really make the  application. Overall I think that George Romney under the when he managed to get the Constitutional  Convention put together for the state of Michigan had the opportunity of serving in that process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:19:57">1:19:57-1:20:17</a>:</strong>  But he made the comment once that science can lead to progress. This is paraphrasing it can lead to  progress. We recognize that with each scientific accomplishment there are some unintended  consequences and we also deal with the unintended consequences. Then we'll see that continuing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:17">1:20:17-1:20:39</a>:</strong>  plateauing growing for us increasing. If we don't recognize that science is merely a tool that we  have and we rely solely on it without recognizing that there are unintended consequences then it  can come back and bite us pretty hard. I think that's what we're seeing in the our general<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:20:39">1:20:39-1:21:00</a>:</strong>  adoption of genetic engineering without recognizing the unintended consequences that are  built into that system either from a mutation standpoint or threat damage that is done. Then  there's a reckoning process that we'll all have to go through. We're going through it now if you<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:00">1:21:00-1:21:22</a>:</strong>  look at the health consequences all you have to do is go to a cancer tumor center or our  doing a child development center. Go to a maternity ward and see what the birth defect that we're  seeing now are becoming so prevalent that you can't ignore them. So we're probably in that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:22">1:21:22-1:21:40</a>:</strong>  reckoning stage and at a time when it becomes important that we start looking back in the box  rather than just outside the box for those solutions that we need for society.  Don what is a question that you wish I would have asked?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:40">1:21:40-1:21:58</a>:</strong>  I don't know I've been gabbing so much that I haven't been thinking about what you should ask.  I think you asked some questions I'd hoped you would. I may not have given you time to do those  but I'm certainly from the topics that we've been on today I didn't get into the GMO glyphosate that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:21:58">1:21:58-1:22:21</a>:</strong>  kind of takes us a little different direction. Very critical when it comes to nutrient density  because of its impact on the soil ecology as a whole or our entire ecology because it's such a  strong mineral chelator as well as that antibiotic effect and the antibiotic effect may be a greater<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:21">1:22:21-1:22:44</a>:</strong>  damage than just the direct chelation. Now it's a broad spectrum antibiotic because it's a broad  spectrum chelator but those areas but I'm really happy to see a lot of the emphasis coming back  to soil ecology the role of different crops and the rotation or in the overall cropping system<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:22:44">1:22:44-1:23:07</a>:</strong>  and use of cover crops. I'm really excited to see that that's something that 60 years ago when I  started in plant pathology and looking at the effect of crop residues and crop sequencing on  the soil borne diseases and there's got to be a better way than saying well you can only grow<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:07">1:23:07-1:23:25</a>:</strong>  an economic crop or your primary economic crop every eight years because the disease pressure  is going to build up on you to the point that it's not going to be economical and we could  demonstrate that very easily back in the 1950s and 60s what those effects were but then in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:25">1:23:25-1:23:45</a>:</strong>  remediation aspect or maintaining the balance and that soil environment the fact that 85 percent of  that effect is the immediately preceding crop means that you can do essentially everything  that we're doing in a five or an eight year rotation and at the same time we're growing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:23:45">1:23:45-1:24:06</a>:</strong>  economic crop and even do better when we look at the improvement in supporting that growing crop  from a nutritional standpoint from nitrogen or other minerals through the form of nitrogen that  we can influence with that farm or with that particular crop food exit aid so I think those<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:06">1:24:06-1:24:26</a>:</strong>  are really exciting. Other people don't seem to get quite as excited as I do but it takes me back  to those things that those questions that I had well how do we do this better if these are things  that we need to do from a biological standpoint isn't there a way to compress some of that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:26">1:24:26-1:24:51</a>:</strong>  process and make it capitalize on the potential dynamics of it although we see the end product on  a consistent basis rather than just the ups and downs that we would have otherwise. It's an  exciting time to see what the next generation's doing what they're looking at now and you see it<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:24:51">1:24:51-1:25:14</a>:</strong>  going both ways. Sometimes you have to do that in order to recognize how it fits back together.  I do agree that there are very exciting times and there are lots of new innovations and also  as you described lots of reinventing the wheel happening and those are good things. Don thank<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/symbiotic-relationships-in-ecology-with-don-huber/#t=1:25:14">1:25:14-1:25:30</a>:</strong>  you very much for joining us. I have enjoyed this interview tremendously and I'm sure our listeners  will as well. It's been a tremendous honor to have you here and we look forward to possibly having  you back in the future. Thank you very much. Appreciate all you do and very honored to be a<br />

This podcast was brought to you by a great company that I work for  AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture, the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006. At AEA,  we believe in challenging the status quo to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow<br />

We also believe that healthy plants are resistant to pests and disease and that to grow  healthy plants we must first think differently about agriculture, about empowering life instead  of suppressing life, about regeneration instead of degeneration. To achieve this we formulate and<br />

In short, we help growers make more money with less risk. Thank you for listening.  </p>
