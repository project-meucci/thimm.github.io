I've discovered that there are many people with  incredible knowledge and information about soil and plant systems and how to develop regenerative  agriculture systems. However, much of this knowledge and this information is scattered,<br />

Some of it has been published in peer-reviewed publications,  but there are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge that has not been published,  and that hasn't been shared with many people.

Tom, you've done some fascinating research over the years, both of  your own and also some with your mentor, Philip Callahan. What are some of your most memorable<br />

Some of the most memorable moments for me were probably  getting fired at the University of Florida, which led me to study under Phil Callahan. So,  that would probably rank near the top. Had that not happened, I certainly would not have been on<br />

So, once that path began and I was looking at the time with  flea larvae, I was playing with them, a seemingly uninteresting insect or so I thought at the time  that led into my PhD project and allowed me to explore world of insect bioelectromagnetics,<br />

So, this has been an exciting journey for  me. The reason why is because it's a new field and the only ones I know who are even remotely<br />

So, therefore, from academia, it's kind of quiet on this front,  but I do enjoy what I'm doing here and I'm happy that I had a chance to explore this fascinating  area of insect bioelectromagnetics. Insect bioelectromagnetics sounds fascinating. Can<br />

What are you actually working on? Not a clue. I couldn't tell  you anything. I'm just making up the word. The word has to do with the electromagnetic waves and  how they are influenced by organisms, thus the name bio. So, electromagnetic simply be involved<br />

Now,  these waves could be external to the organism, let's say environmental, or they could be internal  so that you would have communication going on within the organism as to what information needs<br />

So, the bioelectromagnetic field is relatively large because, I mean, they have a<br />

That is a much, much, much smaller field. So, for those  who are involved in the insect side of it, you can see that they are few and far between. But<br />

And so, all of the research that we do, most of the research that we do is kind of kept under<br />

When you speak of insect bioelectromagnetics,  what is the impact or the potential impact of your work on agriculture and what might farmers<br />

That's a difficult question because when you get involved in the pure  bioelectromagnetics, you're looking at these fields that really are not measurable and for  the most part should not be measurable because the farmer is not going to be out there with the type<br />

So, in a direct sense, there would be very little  impact. In the more general sense, there is a much larger impact that is simply not something that  most people are aware of and that is the energy and how it is acquired by plants. So, photosynthesis<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:06:29">0:06:29-0:06:46</a>:</strong>  is certainly a well-known phenomenon that everyone is familiar with. You find in textbook after  textbook, whether it be in biology or plant physiology. And so, that's kind of a starting  point in the field of bioelectromagnetics is the agriculture. If you can optimize photosynthesis,<br />

I mean, the more a plant photosynthesizes, the higher the Brix reading is  and the higher the Brix reading is, the healthier the plant. And when you have a healthy plant,  this is where you bring it into agriculture and it becomes very important to a farmer. Because<br />

So the sun and the energy that comes from it is  certainly an obvious one. There are less obvious electromagnetic waves out there. The human<br />

Also, would have their influence too. And once you are surrounded by all these frequencies  and be able to absorb the energy or to use this as a communication piece, then you now have healthy<br />

And so understanding that and ways  to optimize the electromagnetic component is only going to benefit the farmers. So if I were giving  a talk and I've given a few talks on energy in agriculture to help them understand these fields<br />

I would love to hear more about your thoughts regarding  photosynthesis. I mean photosynthesis is so foundational that when you drive the increase,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:59</a>:</strong>  you're able to increase photosynthesis, then you have all these other benefits of increasing carbon  sequestration, improving plant health disease and insect resistance. This is something that we  focus a lot of attention on and usually approach from a biochemistry perspective of thinking about<br />

I have a couple of questions for you. One is how much do  you think it's possible to increase photosynthesis above what is common perhaps or normal depending  on how you chose to define that word? How much can it be increased? And looking at photosynthesis<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:14">0:09:14-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  from a bioelectromagnetics perspective, what tools would you use to optimize it and to increase it  if possible? Okay, well your first question and I'll probably forget your second question as I'm  describing the answer to the first, but how much can you increase it? You can increase it<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:46</a>:</strong>  substantially and the reason why I know that is because most of the crops that I've had a chance  to take a look at are between four and eight bricks. Now once you get up to roughly right  around 12, all serious insect damage stops and once you get up to about 14, you have a genuinely<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:20">0:10:20-0:10:35</a>:</strong>  they're not working up to the potential, I know that we absolutely, I mean even getting to nine  which is still not a healthy plant is an improvement over a lot of the plants which I've  had a chance to look at whether it be plants out in someone's backyard or whether it be crop plants<br />

So you do have a range<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:11:10</a>:</strong>  and then if you want to maintain a plant at a very low bricks, let's say one or two, you have to feed  it every day. There's no way around it. So anyone who has ever played the game of golf has walked  on plants that are running about one or two and if you go even one day without feeding that grass<br />

Their root system has been absolutely compromised due to usually what is  being applied and so that's the extreme case where you can actually, in a very artificial way,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:27">0:11:27-0:11:44</a>:</strong>  keep a plant going by continually feeding it. It's a force feeding operation and the same thing goes  with the crop plants. Now the crop plants, the farmer is not out there feeding them on a daily  basis such as you would find on the golf course. That would be obviously the exception but when<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:11:58</a>:</strong>  you're dealing with a crop situation, the farmer is going to be feeding his crops at the minimum.  He's going to be doing it once or twice during the season but probably more often than that  depending upon what type of plant it is, whether it's a perennial or not. So it's a matter of<br />

Now some of the blockages that I'm kind of alluding to that  I discussed a little bit before are certainly and absolutely pesticide. The reason why this is so<br />

So one herbicide is going to selectively kill certain microbes, an insecticide  is going to kill a certain set of microbes as well, a fungicide will kill a certain set of<br />

We have nematicides down here in Florida. They're not as common in the  rest of the country but each one of these is doing its job to kill. Now when these microbes are gone,  they are no longer able to hold on to the energy that is in their body and so you have now given<br />

If you take all of the energy found in a<br />

Now this does not mean that there is this  massive amount of energy that if you stepped on some ground with millions of microbes it would  blow your foot off or it would catapult you into the air. 15 feet, what this means is that this is<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:13:52">0:13:52-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  these microbes can break down minerals far more efficiently than plants and without these microbes  you're no longer able to get the minerals in and these minerals are the constituents, these are the  cofactors that are used to keep photosynthesis going hot and heavy so to speak. So without these<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:58</a>:</strong>  called storms i know the storms are not as common in the rest of the country but down here in  florida we have storms all of the time and so plants you know in a very gentle freak out sort  of fashion when a storm comes in a big storm uh they they shunt all of the sugar down into the<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:39:58">0:39:58-0:40:12</a>:</strong>  roots and so you could have drastic drops in bricks levels when i talk about bricks i'm talking  about leaf bricks you could have drastic drops in leaf bricks we have tested plants that looked  healthy to us they looked healthy like oh this looks like a healthy plant relatively green leaf<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:40:12">0:40:12-0:40:29</a>:</strong>  and we'll test it right before a storm and it comes in at one to three bricks one to three i  mean it's based upon readings like that uh and we've even got to the 10th i've gotten 1.1 1.3  uh and you think to yourself how is this plant even surviving well it's just a temporary thing<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:51:17">0:51:17-0:51:31</a>:</strong>  they eat stuff that we don't want to eat take a look at cockroaches for example there are many  other examples fruit flies they're always around decaying fruit they're not around healthy fruit  and so you've got these insects that are keying in on very specific uh plants or even let's say<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:51:31">0:51:31-0:51:47</a>:</strong>  the fruiting structures like a tomato and that's what they are they are they are keying in on so  the mosquitoes need something that's digestible so when they take a blood meal it must be  incorporated through the process of vitilogenesis take that those nutrients in your blood and<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:51:47">0:51:47-0:52:03</a>:</strong>  incorporate them into an egg and this occurs in about 24 hours so it's all done very very quickly  so if they're not getting digestible blood they cannot through the process of vitilogenesis take  those nutrients and feed their eggs and that's a problem because obviously the mosquito wants to<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/how-insect-pests-identify-unhealthy-plants-with-tom-dykstra/#t=0:54:17">0:54:17-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  mosquitoes as vectors of bacteria okay well i specifically have not infected mosquitoes with  malaria so let me just make that clear right now it wasn't me it was through talking to researchers  and understanding the diseases out there is that many insects most a little bit of this way most<br />
