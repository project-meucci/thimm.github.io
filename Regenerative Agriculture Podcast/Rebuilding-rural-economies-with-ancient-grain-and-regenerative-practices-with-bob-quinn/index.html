<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:00:15">0:00:15-0:00:34</a>:</strong>  I've been looking forward to having this guest join us for a while, Bob Quinn, an organic farmer  from Montana, who is becoming a bit more famous and should become a lot more famous soon, I hope.  Bob, I've been really impressed with the work that you're doing with Chemut and all the work<br />

I've been looking forward to having you here, so thank you for joining me.  Well, John, it's a thrill for me and a real honor, so I'm looking forward to our visit.  Bob, a month or so ago, in the middle of July, we had a field day in Iowa that you contributed to<br />

You know, often when you're at an all-day  conference, you have a really good lunch with desserts and pie and ice cream and potatoes and  beef and chicken or whatever it might be, and after an hour-long lunch, you're going back into<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:01:09">0:01:09-0:01:28</a>:</strong>  the conference and you want to take a nap because you have all that food sitting in your stomach.  And I've always felt that this is a real downside and that we should specifically try to,  for both the presenters' benefit but also for the people who put in the time and the effort<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:01:28">0:01:28-0:01:46</a>:</strong>  and spent the money to be there, if they're there to learn, you can't really learn very well when  you're half asleep. And so we spent some time trying to specifically design a menu that would  make people feel good and give them energy instead of putting them to sleep. And we specifically<br />

And we had  a lot of conversations about the buns and kamut grain at the event. You know the best part? This  was a two-day event, two lunches. I didn't see a single person take a nap either day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:02:07">0:02:07-0:02:25</a>:</strong>  Wow. Well, we know it's high-energy grain, but I haven't had that kind of a testimonial before.  Thanks a lot. That's very interesting. Well, it was just one piece of many, I'm sure,  but it was a very important piece because I think a lot of grains do give people a sugar flush that<br />

Well, this is an ancient wheat that we have been studying for  about 30 years and intensively for probably the last 15, doing a lot of laboratory research,  a lot of research with medical research hospitals studying chronic disease. And we find there's a<br />

And giving people more  energy. Athletes can notice this and several teams in Italy, several soccer teams, I should say, are<br />

And they find more energy and much quicker rebound after hard  practices. It reduces inflammation. So even inflammation in your muscles when you're<br />

So there's something very different and special about it. And I have an idea that most seeds  that we started with, that were created for us, started out this way. And when we started changing<br />

There's  been lots of different changes. And of course, we'd like to think that we've increased yields,  but that may have come at a cost. Many people don't know your story and your background. Bob,<br />

What has been your pathway?  Well, I was raised in north central Montana on a 2,400 acre wheat and cattle ranch that<br />

So my father was raised here. I was raised here and I raised all  my kids here. This year we celebrated a hundred years since my grandfather began our farm,  just after the homesteaders were going out. They had come to this part of Montana about 1916.<br />

So my grandfather came in at that point  after World War I. And my upbringing here was typical of the age, I guess you could say. I was,  however, more interested in plants than I was in animals. So my passion was gardening and science.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  When I got to school, I went to the local schools in Big Sandy, which is a small town of  a thousand then. It's down to 600 now. And graduated and went on to Montana State University,  where I studied botany and plant pathology. I love plants and I love science. So that's how I put<br />

And I just kept on going when I finished a master's at Bozeman at Montana State  and went on to UC Davis and finished a PhD in plant biochemistry. I was a little disillusioned  with the way university was working at that point and seemed to be more focused on getting grants<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:05:38">0:05:38-0:05:58</a>:</strong>  than there was on cooperating with each other to test science. And I decided to come home and join  with my father in farming. And soon our whole farm became my laboratory. I was doing experiments,  done experiments for 40 years as we farmed here. After my father retired, I started experimenting<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:05:58">0:05:58-0:06:16</a>:</strong>  with regenerative organic systems. We didn't call it regenerative in those days, but that's what it  was. We were using legumes to build our soils and then once every other year and then the off years  we would grow our cash crop. So we were trying to build our soils and focus on the soils. And we<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:06:16">0:06:16-0:06:36</a>:</strong>  started that in about 86. So we've been 34 years organic. And at about the same time, realizing  that, a couple years before that, realizing that the 5,400 acre farm when it first came back wasn't  big enough to support two families, even though it supported one very nicely, I started looking for<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:06:36">0:06:36-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  other ways that we could add value to the farm and found a cousin in California who was interested in  available to sell my grain to whole grain bakers in Southern California. We had very immediate  success with that and formed a company. My end was Montana Flower and Grain. He took care of sales<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:12</a>:</strong>  and customer relations and I took care of grain procurement and when our farm didn't produce a  high enough quality, I found grain that was suitable. The second year that we were in business,  they asked for organic grain and that was my first introduction to organic. And I finally<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:07:12">0:07:12-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  met some organic farmers and got acquainted that way and then they wanted to sell them stone ground  flowers. So I got a stone mill and put that in our cleaning plant and we were installing milling  the best which I didn't know anything about, but we just learned as we went and added one customer<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:51</a>:</strong>  to another until it became quite successful. And then we added this ancient grain to the mix in  about 1988 and it took off and we registered a trademark, which was kamut, which is an ancient  word for wheat in Egyptian. Using that trademark, we marketed this grain as something that was<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:07:51">0:07:51-0:08:08</a>:</strong>  always guaranteed to customers, always organic, pure, never adulterated, never genetically modified  or mixed with modern wheat in any way. So that was kind of the launch and it just kind of went  from there, John, into areas that I would have never expected. Our business grew in Europe much<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:08:08">0:08:08-0:08:24</a>:</strong>  more than in this country where they were really interested in ancient wheat and now 75 percent of  everything we grow goes to Italy. They make several thousand, probably 2,500 or 3,000 different  products there. Another 10 percent goes the rest of Europe, about 10 percent to the U.S. and 10<br />

So it's taken me all over the world. I've done experiments  all over almost every country where wheat has grown. I've been there to experiment with this  ancient wheat and see how it compares. So it's been a great experience and I've learned a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:08:43">0:08:43-0:09:01</a>:</strong>  and made lots of friends all over the world. There are so many aspects of the  Camut story that I've heard about from other people and that I've read about in your book  that I want to unwrap. So you chose to trademark the name. What was the inspiration for<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:09:01">0:09:01-0:09:21</a>:</strong>  trademarking rather than doing some other type of variety protection and how has that worked out?  Well, what we saw with spelt, for example, spelt was starting to gain popularity about the same  time. But what people were doing with it was breeding it, crossing it with modern wheat so<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:09:21">0:09:21-0:09:38</a>:</strong>  they could get higher yields. All these ancient grains don't really yield very much, John,  compared to, well I shouldn't say very much. They have a lower yield potential than modern wheat  that's really been bred for high inputs and high yields. The ancient grains and seeds that have<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:09:38">0:09:38-0:09:55</a>:</strong>  never been bred that way or selected for that don't really have that as much. What we saw with  spelt is people were crossing with modern wheat but they still called it spelt. Because spelt is  a generic name, it could mean almost anything. When I saw that, I thought, well that's not what<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:09:55">0:09:55-0:10:15</a>:</strong>  we want. We wanted a mechanism to protect it and to make a guarantee to the public that it is pure  and unadulterated and that's why we chose to market and sell it under a trademark. A trademark  is just a guarantee to our customers that it comes with certain promises which we make and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:10:15">0:10:15-0:10:30</a>:</strong>  guarantees to them, which I've mentioned to you already like being raised organic and never mixed  with other grains. But it doesn't mean that we have any ownership or control over the seed. The  seed we look at is a gift from our maker and it's available to everybody and they can do what they<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:10:30">0:10:30-0:10:45</a>:</strong>  want with it. But if they're going to go to the market and they want to call it kamuth, then they  need to be part of our program and follow the rules. If they want to call it something else,  they can do whatever they want. So that was our reasoning and our mechanism by which we started<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:10:45">0:10:45-0:11:03</a>:</strong>  this whole kamuth project. I find it interesting that increasingly trademarks are being used to  protect and to market specific fruit varieties, particularly apples. We now have Cosmic Crisp  being marketed very intensely and we've had Honeycrisp historically and more and more I see<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:11:03">0:11:03-0:11:22</a>:</strong>  different varieties that are being protected with a trademark. I know there are many people who are  thinking about ways to develop markets for unique products. How has that trademarking process worked  out for you? Has that been able to produce the outcomes you were hoping for? Yes, very much so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:41</a>:</strong>  So the trademark has been a great success for us. We've had people who have tried to sell kamuth,  they called something kamuth and it was completely out of our program and the quality was poor and we  were able to stop that. We had complaints from our customers saying, well, your grain has corn in it<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:59</a>:</strong>  and all kinds of other impurities. And we said, well, that's impossible because we don't grow it,  where corn is grown and so it's not clean where corn is even clean. And so we knew that something  was wrong and we traced it back to someone who was licensed to use our trademark but was actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:11:59">0:11:59-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  contracting with farmers clear outside our region that we normally grow it. And it was much inferior  and it was of course causing customer complaints. And that's exactly the reason that we have  for registering and using a trademark in the first place so that we could guarantee quality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:12:15">0:12:15-0:12:34</a>:</strong>  And we were able to do it with a trademark and we said to him, you can't ever do that again. And if  you do, you're out of the program. And we didn't stick our lawyers on him or anything. We just told  him that that was his, he used up his last chance to not tell the truth. And if he was going to come<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:12:34">0:12:34-0:12:49</a>:</strong>  stay with us and tell the truth and allow us to audit him every year, we would still welcome them.  But those are the kinds of incidents we've had. There's been a couple others where they just  opted to just go on their own way. And that's fine. I mean, it's their choice. But what we<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:12:49">0:12:49-0:13:05</a>:</strong>  want to guarantee is quality, John, and so that the people get what they're paying for because  the farmers are paid much more for this and the customers pay more. But what they're getting is  a higher value for their increased cost of their end product or even the grain. And that's, we want<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:13:05">0:13:05-0:13:25</a>:</strong>  to make sure that that's guaranteed. Let's talk about the business side of it a little bit. What  is the scale that you're operating on? How many acres have you been able to impact? And how were  you able to bring about that scale of production? Well, we just went from one year to another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:13:25">0:13:25-0:13:40</a>:</strong>  My philosophy in doing business is start small and build on your success. I don't have a big  pile of money, so I can't go out and just try great big experiments. I try small experiments.  And if they're successful, then I build on those. And that's what we did. We started with a half an<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:13:40">0:13:40-0:14:01</a>:</strong>  acre, which is all the seeds that we had in 1988 when we first planted it in the field at that  rate. Thirty years later, we were contracting with 250 regenerative organic farmers in Montana,  Alberta, and Saskatchewan for over 100,000 acres of this stuff. So that really, really made an<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:14:01">0:14:01-0:14:19</a>:</strong>  impact on organic farming in the upper Great Plains because we only, well, we require that  our farmers not plant more than 20% of their farm, of their crop acres to this grain, even though  it's probably the most valuable crop they can grow so that we do not disturb their rotations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:14:19">0:14:19-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  So they have ample opportunities to have a four or five or six year rotation, which works best with  regenerative organic agriculture. And we also require them to plant a soil building legume,  preferably a legume crop or some mixed cover crop with legumes in it the year before<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:14:39">0:14:39-0:14:57</a>:</strong>  they plant their cash crop of kalut brand wheat. And by doing that, we know they're going to have  good quality to build their soil, so it turns into good quality. And so we are making sure that our  growers really are using regenerative practices. They're not certified that way, but they are under<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:14:57">0:14:57-0:15:13</a>:</strong>  contract to at least for that one year that they're going for us to follow or to appreciate  it with a soil building practice. I really believe in the regenerative organic agriculture and try to  promote it every way I can. And this is a good way that we've been able to promote it and then help<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:15:13">0:15:13-0:15:29</a>:</strong>  those that have made the jump and made the commitment to do it themselves. So if you are  contracting 20% of their acres and 100,000 acres total, that means you're impacting half a million  acres, which is a very significant impact. There's not many people here in North America at this<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:15:29">0:15:29-0:15:45</a>:</strong>  stage, I don't believe that have impacted that number of acres and facilitating a transition.  That leads me to ask the question, how did you bring that about? And from conversations we've  had in the past, I believe the answer is pricing and economic incentives. So how have you priced<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:15:45">0:15:45-0:16:06</a>:</strong>  the production of this grain? And then also how does that connect to the marketing?  Well, as I mentioned, John, I'm a long-term farmer and I know that farmers are preyed upon by  buyers most of the time and never can get enough to really advance profitably in their farms. They're<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:16:06">0:16:06-0:16:24</a>:</strong>  always living on the edge. And so when we started this whole grain project, I wanted something that  people could make a profit from and be happy with and have some satisfaction financially from  growing it and putting the effort in. So we decided to just arbitrarily set the price of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:16:24">0:16:24-0:16:45</a>:</strong>  the grain that we were buying at three times the highest market for non-organic grain it was for  wheat at that time, which is about $3 about 30 years ago. And so we set the price at $9 a bushel  and the growers were very excited about that. Most of the organic grain was going for about twice<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:16:46">0:16:46-0:17:06</a>:</strong>  the price of non-organic wheat in those days. So this is a significant jump even over the organic  prices. And as we went, we were able to increase that even more. And so now it's been as much as  five times. And that has come a little bit in the consequence of competing for acres. When we<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:17:06">0:17:06-0:17:22</a>:</strong>  started to grow and require more acres and there are other demands on wheat, we found that we  sometimes ended up in a bidding war with farmers. And as long as our end users were able to make it  work for them, because it has to work for everybody. The other part of my business<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:17:22">0:17:22-0:17:40</a>:</strong>  philosophy is that everybody wins. And if the customer can't sell it, if it's overpriced,  so he can't sell it, then he can't win either. So it won't go on. It won't be sustainable.  And we worked very closely with our buyers and manufacturers and helped them with understanding<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:17:40">0:17:40-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  the higher value that this grain had. And a lot of people who couldn't eat modern wheat  found they could eat it. So they understood immediately the higher value it had. And  many of them that ate it could feel the difference in their bodies, just as you were mentioning<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:17:54">0:17:54-0:18:14</a>:</strong>  with people not going to sleep. People could feel the higher energy. People could notice right away  that there wasn't any problem with digestion or cramps or something to say that many have with  sensitivities to modern wheat. So that was something that wasn't just smoke mirrors or fancy<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:18:14">0:18:14-0:18:31</a>:</strong>  marketing. It was just explaining to people what we had discovered and then asking them to try it  themselves and see if they could feel the difference and taste the difference. It also is  very tasty, has a great flavor and aromas. And that was also a help to us. How did the economics<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:18:31">0:18:31-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  end up working out for the growers? You mentioned that you're today at five times the price, if I  understood correctly, the commodity wheat price. You also mentioned a bit ago in our conversation  that the yields are smaller with these ancient grains and they don't have the same yield<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:19:05</a>:</strong>  potential. So how do the economics end up working out for the farmer at the end of the day on a per  acre profitability potential? Generally the average in the Durham growing, it grows best  down where Durham goes best. And so where there's a good history of Durham being successful,<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:19:06">0:19:06-0:19:25</a>:</strong>  like in Northeast Montana, South Central and Southeast Saskatchewan, the yields are not so  much different. Maybe five, ten percent and maybe some years it's just even and even a little bit  more sometimes. But it averages about 10 percent less. Further away you get from that it could be<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:19:25">0:19:25-0:19:43</a>:</strong>  up to 20 percent and that would be 25 at the most. And that's compared to spring wheat now because  it's a spring grain. Our winter grains where they can grow winter wheat is using much higher  yield and so when the people are comparing those two it's not really apples to apples.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:59</a>:</strong>  It's spring wheat to winter wheat and so the yield in the same area is going to be quite a bit  different. But since it's a spring wheat and those different spring wheat areas we don't have that  comparison too often. So if it if they have a 20 percent less yield and you're getting four to<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:19:59">0:19:59-0:20:17</a>:</strong>  five times more per bushel you're coming out very well and then with organic cost of organic  production for grains in the upper grade plains is normally one-third to one-half less depending  on how much of inputs you are growing with with your chemical agriculture. You're not buying those<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:20:17">0:20:17-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  expensive inputs and you're growing your own inputs. We see a significant reduction in the  cost of your farm organic regenerative organic systems. So you're really gaining on both ends  of it higher price lower inputs and that more than covers the small decrease in yields. Our yields are<br />

So if we're under a severe drought this grain  actually will out yield because it has some drought resistance it will out yield modern wheat  and chemical agriculture. If we're having just an average year then it will be pretty close. I mean<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:21:13</a>:</strong>  then you're closer you're 10 percent. If we're having a very successful year with really good  range or extra range the yield potential of modern wheat and also with chemical agriculture  does exceed organic by 20, 30, 40 percent. But you're into really good yields and so it's not a<br />

But they don't come very often  and maybe one year and five is that way. And the average though you're much better off over the<br />

When you were describing how the distribution of this grain  you mentioned that the majority 80 percent if I understood correctly is going to Europe in total  with Italy being a significant proportion of that. Why so much more significantly in the European<br />

Well that's a really good question John. Why is it so much more  of interest in Europe than here? One thing that you find in Europe is more interest in organic  in the first place than in America. Even though we have a higher dollar value we sell in America<br />

But our percent of organic food  that's sold in America is around six percent. Many countries in Europe are exceeding that some  double and some triple that almost. But in Italy which led the way for our big growth in the world<br />

And to them it is just like the old timers tell me it's like pasta that they used to have.  And remember even before World War II the smell of it in the factory as it's being manufactured<br />

So they're very big  interest in this and they're very very critical and picking about the quality of their food. And  if you have something that's an extremely high quality they're very very interested in it. And<br />

Earlier we spoke about some of the nutritive value or nutrient potential that may have been  lost with our modern breeding as we bred for bins and bushels production and we didn't give<br />

What is the nutritional value for us as consumers of this  grain as compared to modern grain? Has anyone been looking at that? Well we've looked at specific  aspects and we did chemical analysis minerals and nutritional profile with proteins and fatty acids<br />

One thing that we  saw was that selenium was quite high it was about three times or a third higher than modern wheat<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:24:41">0:24:41-0:24:59</a>:</strong>  that was able to absorb and and put into grain even growing side by side and that was of interest  to us and because the selenium was high and we thought and we knew selenium was a strong  antioxidant we designed some experiments in Italy with rats looking at antioxidant capacity<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  like a hilltop or an upper a higher level higher of the field and then seeps down into the field  and hits an impervious layer of clay or a really hard sandstone or something it forces it back up  and then it comes back up to the top of the ground with all these dissolved salts it's common to<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:56:50">0:56:50-0:57:06</a>:</strong>  and they said this is the most fantastic oil we've ever seen or tasted and make better fried  chicken and better french fries than anything we can buy we'll give you two dollars a pound for it  so now all of a sudden i had an oil that was worth two dollars a pound and there's about eight pounds<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:57:06">0:57:06-0:57:25</a>:</strong>  of a gallon and so i could either buy diesel for three or four dollars a gallon or i could use my  oil for it was worth 16 and so it didn't take me very long to figure out the economics of that  and i started selling it to restaurants for cooking oil and we picked up a pretty large<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:57:25">0:57:25-0:57:39</a>:</strong>  accounts at montana state university and the university of montana and the university of  montana particularly was very interested in letting us have the oil back because i thought  well if i could get the oil back the used oil just clean it up take the water out of it filter it<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:57:39">0:57:39-0:57:58</a>:</strong>  centrifuge it just clean it i could use the used oil in my diesel and tractor that's what i started  to do so we were able to eliminate the whole discussion of food versus fuel argument about  how we should farm and what we should use our land for by using our land first to grow food and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:57:58">0:57:58-0:58:18</a>:</strong>  use that food once it was spent in the case of used vegetable oil for fuel and so again it was  a case where everybody wins and particularly the environment and and i found on being a farmer if  you can sell something you raise twice uh john it really increases the profitability so that's a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:58:18">0:58:18-0:58:36</a>:</strong>  more fun yeah that's a really uh really great story and i thank you for sharing that when you  think about all these various ventures bob you you have been able to make a significant impact  on agriculture you're running lots of experiments and trying different things what do you see as the<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:58:53">0:58:53-0:59:11</a>:</strong>  and that's where most of my neighbors are giving their information and a lot of the research that's  coming out of the university that supports that you know the usca budget for agriculture research  is 99 focused on chemical inputs and farming with chemicals biotech and all this artificial things<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:59:11">0:59:11-0:59:31</a>:</strong>  and if we had more research money donated or earmarked for regenerative organic systems we  could have a lot of new ideas of how to farm better and more profitably we just need to put  the pressure on to encourage that but in the meantime i would encourage farmers to<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:59:31">0:59:31-0:59:48</a>:</strong>  look up organizations that are tied to regenerative organic and and go affiliate there and go to their  meetings and meet some of the people that are farming this way and get some ideas about what's  going on and the demand for organic food in this country is far exceeding the supply we have one<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=0:59:48">0:59:48-1:00:06</a>:</strong>  percent of our farmland now is organic or a little bit more than that but over six percent of food is  organic so we're way behind as farmers we need to really catch up and see how we might fit into that  and it's now there's opportunities really in every region to do so we just need to to well go the<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:00:06">1:00:06-1:00:24</a>:</strong>  internet you can find everything there now and and see where the nearest demand for organic whatever  you're growing is organic vegetables or or grains or whatever you grow where's the nearest demand  for that and i guarantee you'll find some because a lot of the deficiency that we are not making<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:00:55">1:00:55-1:01:15</a>:</strong>  view i believe that regenerative organic agriculture is the future and it's the only  future that makes sense because everything else is based on artificial crutches that are starting to  produce more problems than they're solving and that's certainly different than what mainstream<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:01:15">1:01:15-1:01:34</a>:</strong>  agriculture is told and therefore what they believe and i think the sooner we understand that  the quicker we can start to make the changes that will benefit us all what is the topic that you  would like to speak about more often but you are hesitant to because you sense that many farmers<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:01:34">1:01:34-1:01:54</a>:</strong>  may not be open to it or may not be ready to hear about it well let's see i think i'd like to speak  more directly to converting to regenerative organic systems on each and every farm and the  opportunities that exist there one thing john that you can't force change on people you have to<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:01:54">1:01:54-1:02:14</a>:</strong>  demonstrate and be able to show that it's going to be better and and there's a reason to change  and so i don't come out too strong without backup what i would like to do with my farm is donate 600  acres out of the middle of it to create an organic research center so that people can actually come<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:02:14">1:02:14-1:02:34</a>:</strong>  and see for themselves and field size plots that various rotations that have possibilities how to  grow different cocktails and and and use different cover crops for soil building using animal  components and and comparing it with um a neighbor of mine who's willing to rent me several acres<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:02:34">1:02:34-1:02:50</a>:</strong>  right next to it for organic compared to chemical agriculture and looking at different scenarios for  conversion those are the kinds of things i would like to do and just by going out and say well  organic is better and we should all be doing it that doesn't really go very far because people<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:02:50">1:02:50-1:03:08</a>:</strong>  don't understand how it could work on their own farm and if we could show more farmers how it  could really work on their own farm because it works fairly close to home for them multiply those  demonstrations and those and feature those successes all over the country in every region<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:03:08">1:03:08-1:03:23</a>:</strong>  i think would be a great help this actually reminds me of a question that i wanted to ask  that is i think an important question but i missed it when we were speaking about  dry land the vegetable production how do you control weeds in your vegetable production<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:03:24">1:03:24-1:03:45</a>:</strong>  that's still undergoing experimentation john the weed control is a very um a big part of it i've  had some great success with flaming of my potatoes for example my planting potatoes fairly early in  the spring and the weeds will come up with the potatoes because it takes them so long to emerge<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:03:45">1:03:45-1:04:03</a>:</strong>  and if i flame them right at the emergence of the potatoes it gives me another way to control them  waiting for the time when i will then heal the potatoes and i can cover up young weeds with the  healing process that would come later but without the flaming the weeds are too big to be destroyed<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:04:03">1:04:03-1:04:18</a>:</strong>  with healing i found that this year for the first time was quite successful so i'm interested in  trying that with some of my other vegetables i know that people use that in different parts of  the country we just i haven't seen it here or you know had experience with it or experimenting with<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:04:18">1:04:18-1:04:38</a>:</strong>  different mulching types of mulch for amounts of mulch in the future i think that that's another  thing that could also conserve moisture and also manage weeds and we've had terrible grasshopper  clays this year and also a hail storm that went through and one of my co-workers asked me said<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:04:38">1:04:38-1:04:54</a>:</strong>  well what other kind of plagues are there we can expect in montana i said well drought is watched  and that can be very serious but with heavy mulch maybe that would be a give us protection besides  controlling weeds right now i'm doing mostly cultivation which leaves the ground completely<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:04:54">1:04:54-1:05:12</a>:</strong>  bare which i don't really like either but i've seen that if i have competition when i'm assuming  even if we have ground cover that there's not enough water to support both the ground cover  and the cash crop at the same time so i'm still experimenting with that kind of thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/regenerativeagriculture/Bob_Quinn_Final_Audio_RAP_S3_Ep_17.mp3#t=1:05:12">1:05:12-1:05:33</a>:</strong>  john but until then i'm just still relying on steel to um got my weeds down  wonderful well bob i want to extend a tremendous thank you for agreeing to be here and to share  your wisdom and knowledge and to all of our listeners the book again is grain by grain<br />
