<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:07">0:00:07-0:00:14</a>:</strong>  produce crops that are completely resistant  to diseases and insects,  and produce food of such an exceptional quality<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:20">0:00:20-0:00:26</a>:</strong>  with incredible knowledge and information  about soil and plant systems.  However, much of this knowledge and information<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:26">0:00:26-0:00:33</a>:</strong>  is scattered all over the place.  There are many incredible stories and a lot of knowledge  that have not been widely shared.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:33">0:00:33-0:00:42</a>:</strong>  I founded Advancing Eco-Agriculture in 2006  to bring this knowledge together in a more coherent fashion  and incorporate it into products and growing systems<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:00:48">0:00:48-0:00:54</a>:</strong>  become the mainstream globally,  the status quo against which all other growing systems  are compared.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:00">0:01:00-0:01:07</a>:</strong>  These concepts and principles about regenerative systems  can be applied anywhere.  And when they're properly applied,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:07">0:01:07-0:01:14</a>:</strong>  they will increase farm profitability  and resilience to climate stress.  If you have any questions, suggestions, comments,<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:32">0:01:32-0:01:41</a>:</strong>  Hi friends, welcome to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  I'm back with Gary Zimmer for the second time.  Gary is the first consultant that we've hosted<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:41">0:01:41-0:01:45</a>:</strong>  twice in a row.  Gary's had a lot of thoughts and insights  that we wanted to follow up on<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:45">0:01:45-0:01:51</a>:</strong>  and get into some more detail.  Pleasure to be here.  And yes, we talked about some different topics and things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:51">0:01:51-0:01:56</a>:</strong>  I look forward to it.  I've been doing some thinking and searching  and hopefully we can share some information here<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:01:56">0:01:56-0:02:02</a>:</strong>  of my life experiences.  Gary, one of the pieces that we spoke of a little bit,  and this is fresh on my mind<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:02">0:02:02-0:02:10</a>:</strong>  because I had a webinar last night  where I got onto a soapbox a little bit,  was nitrogen management and some of the challenges<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:10">0:02:10-0:02:17</a>:</strong>  and the opportunities with nitrogen management today  and ways that we can improve it.  What have you learned about nitrogen management<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:17">0:02:17-0:02:23</a>:</strong>  and how we can do it better?  So first I always start out and I tell farmers  that I don't know if they all realize that<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:23">0:02:23-0:02:30</a>:</strong>  nitrogen is a necessary evil,  but it's also can cause a lot of trouble.  We go way back into the early years<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:30">0:02:30-0:02:35</a>:</strong>  when everybody started growing corn  and they started using nitrogen  and the volume of residues grew twice as big.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:35">0:02:35-0:02:40</a>:</strong>  They said, man, this is gonna be great.  We're really gonna grow organic matter now.  Well, 50 years later, guess what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:40">0:02:40-0:02:46</a>:</strong>  It went down.  So excess nitrogen is always an issue out here  and they always blame tillage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:46">0:02:46-0:02:51</a>:</strong>  But now even with no till and excess nitrogen,  you burn up carbon.  So you're always balancing that carbon to nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:51">0:02:51-0:02:58</a>:</strong>  kind of a situation.  So my whole thing on nitrogen is this.  I think we can get people off the recommendations<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:02:58">0:02:58-0:03:03</a>:</strong>  at 1.1 pounds of nitrogen per bushel of corn,  let's just pick on corn.  I would say that we ought to be able to get that down<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:03">0:03:03-0:03:08</a>:</strong>  to 0.5 where a lot of people function.  In order to do that,  there is a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:08">0:03:08-0:03:16</a>:</strong>  There is a biological link  and they all like to talk about nitrogen credits,  whether they be from a legume or a soybean<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:16">0:03:16-0:03:25</a>:</strong>  or whatever they're from.  And I like to talk about the fact that  let's put it in the term digestibility and solubility<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:25">0:03:25-0:03:34</a>:</strong>  because we see, I was at a conference in Pennsylvania  a couple of years back and they had grown hairy batch  and it was huge and it was rank.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:34">0:03:34-0:03:38</a>:</strong>  And they said that we got all these nitrogen credits  and the corn was sick and yellow.  They said, we don't understand,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:38">0:03:38-0:03:44</a>:</strong>  we got all these nitrogen credits.  And next to it, they had a plot where they had clover  and alfalfa that they had worked down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:44">0:03:44-0:03:50</a>:</strong>  It was only a foot tall and it was lush and green.  And that corn was absolutely beautiful.  It had a lot less nitrogen credits.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:50">0:03:50-0:03:58</a>:</strong>  So what's going on is the term digestibility.  Of course, being a dairy nutritionist,  treating salt like treating cows is a reality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:03:58">0:03:58-0:04:05</a>:</strong>  And so I said, you took that pure mature crop of batch,  ripe seeds and everything in it,  and you fed it to a dairy cow,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:05">0:04:05-0:04:11</a>:</strong>  how much milk would you get?  Not very much.  Although you got a pile of nitrogen, it's not digestible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:11">0:04:11-0:04:18</a>:</strong>  The young succulent clover was digestible.  So I think that's a huge part of nitrogen management.  Previous crops, that's why it was corn on corn<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:18">0:04:18-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  and you got corn stalks.  Not only don't you have something that's highly digestible,  you don't have a very big nitrogen base.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  And so that's why starting that pre-digestion  a little bit earlier.  So what this digestibility really is,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:30">0:04:30-0:04:39</a>:</strong>  is about managing biology.  Bugs that eat that young succulent clover and alfalfa  are not the same ones that eat that mature rank thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:39">0:04:39-0:04:46</a>:</strong>  It's a whole lot easier to digest something  that's soluble than something that's complex carbons.  And that's all a part of nitrogen management.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:46">0:04:46-0:04:52</a>:</strong>  So I tell people, first, you gotta get beyond the fact  that it's a numbers game.  It's not so many pounds of nitrogen so much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:52">0:04:52-0:04:59</a>:</strong>  I've seen some pretty incredible crops growing  with pretty low levels of purchased nitrogen.  Nobody grew it without nitrogen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:04:59">0:04:59-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  They grew it without purchased nitrogen.  There's a huge difference.  And so my whole thing is this, that as time goes on,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:12</a>:</strong>  because we farm organically,  we actually do soil nitrogen tests  and we look at how we manage to cover crops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:12">0:05:12-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  And we always say, you gotta have a beautiful, lush,  high digestible, high kind of a nitrogen cover crop.  It could even be a grass as long as it's lush<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:19">0:05:19-0:05:25</a>:</strong>  and taken down at the right stage.  There's a lot of milk produced on high digestible grasses.  First, you gotta get that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:25">0:05:25-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  If you don't have that good stand,  then how do you back down on nitrogen?  I think there's now a couple of people out here,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:31">0:05:31-0:05:36</a>:</strong>  scientific researchers,  some with the U.S. Department of Agriculture  and one from Australia that are now convinced<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:36">0:05:36-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  that as time goes on,  once you start backing off of this soluble nitrogen thing,  you'll start to have more biology build up in the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:48</a>:</strong>  that actually can pull nitrogen out of the atmosphere.  Can we propagate that?  It's almost like saying,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:48">0:05:48-0:05:56</a>:</strong>  if I put a lot of nitrogen in front of an alfalfa  or a soybean crop, will I get as many nodules?  I think there's pretty good evidence that you won't,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:05:56">0:05:56-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  because the plant determines the soil life  and there's a bath and nitrogen, they don't get it.  So this whole nitrogen management thing,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:10</a>:</strong>  I think gets down to our biology is the link  and we can actually grow more nitrogen.  That's the only thing we can grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:10">0:06:10-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  Other inputs need to be provided  and we gotta have these beautiful, healthy soils  that gotta be fed and fed the kind of materials<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:23</a>:</strong>  that digest well and give us out nitrogen.  Now going through that all,  how does a farmer deal with that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:23">0:06:23-0:06:27</a>:</strong>  We'll just talk conventionally,  there's a lot of guys going to the organic world  and they wanna buy chicken manure or something<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:27">0:06:27-0:06:32</a>:</strong>  because they think they gotta put pound for pound  with the nitrogen on here  and I don't think they really understand that well enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:32">0:06:32-0:06:40</a>:</strong>  Well, let's just talk about a conventional one.  My thought would be on a conventional farm  that best way to be is whatever we got<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:40">0:06:40-0:06:45</a>:</strong>  for our little starters  or stuff we put out there in the beginning  and depending upon the previous crop and whatnot,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:45">0:06:45-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  I would start out by side dressing my nitrogen.  I wanna be able to split my nitrogen  and I tell farmers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  nitrogen is the easiest thing in the world.  If you're conventional and we're back on corn again  and I got whatever I start out with<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:03</a>:</strong>  and then I wanna come along and side dress them  and hopefully I got good enough and big enough equipment,  I can side dress it even later season,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:03">0:07:03-0:07:09</a>:</strong>  I can vary my rates.  I can test out what my farm,  how it responds to nitrogen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:09">0:07:09-0:07:17</a>:</strong>  Understanding that the longer I'm at this,  that's why I can't do it just once  and say, oh, my farm needs 30 gallons of 32% or whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:17">0:07:17-0:07:25</a>:</strong>  is to say I gotta constantly keep testing it  because as time goes on and my soils get better  because I wanna use as little as possible<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:25">0:07:25-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  and I wanna put it when and where I need it  and I wanna use it for a purpose.  So splitting the nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:36</a>:</strong>  and then I'd like to add a carbon to it.  So our whole preferred thing is we like our molasses  or I could put a humate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:36">0:07:36-0:07:42</a>:</strong>  I wanna put something to kind of buffer it out.  If I was gonna use a dry,  I would use some ammonium sulfate,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:42">0:07:42-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  possibly some, we use ESN,  environmentally smart polymer coated nitrogen  on a lot of our conventional farms<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:07:55</a>:</strong>  or I would use a sulfa  because sulfa can replace part of our nitrogen.  So this whole nitrogen thing I think can be made simpler,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:07:55">0:07:55-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  although I went through this maybe too fast,  but it can also be a fairly simple out here on this thing.  Just like we had this meeting the other day<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:10</a>:</strong>  and this guy's a hog farmer  and he keeps getting a response  from putting on more nitrogen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:10">0:08:10-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  I finally said to the guys,  maybe it's not the nitrogen,  maybe it's the carbon dioxide that's giving him a response.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:20</a>:</strong>  Exactly.  So when he puts on this extra nitrogen,  later in the season, he still got residues.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:20">0:08:20-0:08:24</a>:</strong>  You know that Francis Childs,  the first guy to grow that 400 bushel corn,  what did he say?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:24">0:08:24-0:08:29</a>:</strong>  If you're gonna grow 400 bushel corn,  you probably should follow 500 bushel corn  because you need those residues<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:29">0:08:29-0:08:34</a>:</strong>  for the carbon dioxide release.  What are your thoughts on that?  I couldn't agree more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:34">0:08:34-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  I still see farmers applying nitrogen in the fall  and that to me is,  I'm just gonna say exactly what I think about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:49</a>:</strong>  That is dumb.  That's the dumbest thing.  I cannot see that making agronomic sense<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:49">0:08:49-0:08:55</a>:</strong>  from any perspective, no matter how you look at it.  And I was thinking about this to a grower  and I was asked the question as well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:08:55">0:08:55-0:09:02</a>:</strong>  why do we get such a big response from nitrogen applications?  I believe a large part of it  is coming from the carbon dioxide,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:02">0:09:02-0:09:11</a>:</strong>  from the CO2 response,  because nitrogen is going to solubilize our organic matter,  which going back to a point that you made at the beginning<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:11">0:09:11-0:09:18</a>:</strong>  is why have we lost organic matter  with continued increase nitrogen applications  over the last 50 years?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:23">0:09:23-0:09:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah, because Roy's balancing that carbon nitrogen ratio,  that basis.  And the other thing is when the guy puts that nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:29">0:09:29-0:09:34</a>:</strong>  on the fall and I don't disagree with you,  and I struggled with this one for a little while,  because the way I say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:34">0:09:34-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  well, let's say you're growing corn on corn,  let's start the digestion process,  because if I can get that digested down,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:47</a>:</strong>  I cut down on my disease and insects.  I said, but you're boiling carbon dioxide  off into the atmosphere and there's no plant to absorb it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:47">0:09:47-0:09:52</a>:</strong>  If you want to drive your higher yields,  you want to save all the carbon you can to release it  during the growing season,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:52">0:09:52-0:09:59</a>:</strong>  when the corn needs all that carbon dioxide.  But putting a little bit, like we're saying,  even if it's a light coat of manure,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:09:59">0:09:59-0:10:07</a>:</strong>  or maybe only 10, 15 units of nitrogen,  we like to maybe add a biological to it.  Maybe we'd add a little sugars to it with our molasses,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:07">0:10:07-0:10:14</a>:</strong>  and we'd spray that on those corn stalks  right behind the harvest and lightly work them in the ground  so the digestion process starts,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:14">0:10:14-0:10:20</a>:</strong>  and then the carbon and a little bit of nitrogen we add  can go into bodies of bugs,  and it's not really a boil off of carbon dioxide<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:20">0:10:20-0:10:24</a>:</strong>  in the atmosphere.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, that's different from applying 100 pounds<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:24">0:10:24-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  of nitrogen in the fall.  Yes.  And I think the other thing on this,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:33</a>:</strong>  that's why nitrogen is such a,  it's not, that's why it's not a numbers game.  I tell people, just think,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:33">0:10:33-0:10:39</a>:</strong>  if you're a farm, every year it should get better,  and once you get down to having a huge population  of earthworms doing all that digestion,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:39">0:10:39-0:10:48</a>:</strong>  there's 72% protein, there are 11% nitrogen.  Our numbers that I read, and I don't know how accurate,  maybe someone's gonna argue with the scientific behind it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:48">0:10:48-0:10:54</a>:</strong>  but 25 worms in a cubic foot,  we always said is 80 units of nitrogen,  just some old dead nine worms,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:10:54">0:10:54-0:11:00</a>:</strong>  if they're there throughout the season.  So now how do you put that in your formula?  Exactly, and so you've mentioned that comment<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:00">0:11:00-0:11:06</a>:</strong>  a couple of times, that a pound of nitrogen  is not a pound of nitrogen is not all the same,  and this is something that we've observed as well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:06">0:11:06-0:11:14</a>:</strong>  is that there's this idea that it takes so many units  of nitrogen to grow a bunch of grain crop,  and yet we sometimes see pretty extraordinary yields<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:27</a>:</strong>  How does that work?  Yeah, and that's exactly right,  and it's because there's this biology link,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:27">0:11:27-0:11:31</a>:</strong>  and we're getting it there, and someone says,  well, if I build my organic matter,  I'll get more nitrogen, and he says,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:31">0:11:31-0:11:38</a>:</strong>  well, you know, that might be a 10-year project,  and we can have responses really quick,  because we just transitioned some more land organically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:38">0:11:38-0:11:46</a>:</strong>  Now we grew oats, we left the straw out there,  we underseeded with clover and alfalfa,  we did it two years in a row.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:46">0:11:46-0:11:52</a>:</strong>  So last year we worked that all back in,  and just like people put on manure,  and they said, well, you only can count 40% of the credits<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:52">0:11:52-0:11:57</a>:</strong>  for your nitrogen on that manure.  I said, what if I did it three years in a row?  So last year we put the cover crop back in the ground<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:11:57">0:11:57-0:12:05</a>:</strong>  along with the straw, which would help build up  my organic matters in my soil possibly,  or at least gives me more fiber structural things<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:05">0:12:05-0:12:11</a>:</strong>  to help improve my soil structure.  Now we do it again this year,  and then that clover and everything is out there right now,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:11">0:12:11-0:12:16</a>:</strong>  we'll mow it down this fall.  Next spring when that gets a foot tall,  we'll likely work that in,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:16">0:12:16-0:12:22</a>:</strong>  I'm a real believer in my shallow incorporating,  and then we'll plant the crop.  So how much nitrogen have I really built?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:22">0:12:22-0:12:29</a>:</strong>  Some came from last year, some came from this year.  I got some older stuff,  and I got some fresh succulent stuff I'm breaking down,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:29">0:12:29-0:12:34</a>:</strong>  so I got almost a time to release nitrogen.  Now we probably will put a little dairy manure on  because we're a dairy farm,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:34">0:12:34-0:12:43</a>:</strong>  but we will not see any issues that I know of  that we never see yellowing corn,  we never see nitrogen is not our limiting factor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:43">0:12:43-0:12:48</a>:</strong>  It's one of the pieces that we've observed as well.  I can't even begin to describe how many farms  we begin working with,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:48">0:12:48-0:12:55</a>:</strong>  and of course we're working with sap analysis.  We start working with sap analysis  and the plants tell us, and the sap analysis,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:12:55">0:12:55-0:13:01</a>:</strong>  and the lower older leaves  that they don't need more nitrogen.  Many cases after we've cut nitrogen applications<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:01">0:13:01-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  by anywhere from 30 to 60%, huge numbers,  where we're dramatically reducing nitrogen applications.  And I think this goes to atmospheric nitrogen fixation<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  and the fact that that might not happen as well  if you apply a lot of nitrogen upfront.  So I guess the question that I have in that for you is,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:28</a>:</strong>  what have you observed or what have you experienced  with atmospheric nitrogen absorption?  Well, that's like I said, it's a hard one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:28">0:13:28-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  I'm totally convinced that there's certain organisms  that this whole system was designed to work  for a while in the beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:39</a>:</strong>  There's certain opportunities  that the plants determine soil life,  and if they need more nitrogen out here,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:39">0:13:39-0:13:45</a>:</strong>  there are certain organisms  that are gonna rise to the occasion,  especially if we got a base of carbon to digest from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:45">0:13:45-0:13:51</a>:</strong>  Now that all takes time, and as time goes on,  my observations were that our need for nitrogen  also goes down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:51">0:13:51-0:13:58</a>:</strong>  We actually cleared some land that was in Christmas trees,  which was 20-year-old pine trees,  and so there's nothing been grown on it<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:13:58">0:13:58-0:14:03</a>:</strong>  for a long period of time,  and it was already could be certified organic.  And so we actually put a fair bit of manure out there<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:03">0:14:03-0:14:08</a>:</strong>  and grow corn, and guess what happened?  It turned yellow.  Now, the bottom ends, it wasn't a disaster,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:08">0:14:08-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  but even putting on manure nitrogen,  but I guarantee you by next year or the year after,  give us three years and that'll all go away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:21</a>:</strong>  So what happened?  We had to change the biology,  had to rise to the occasion to fill in the gap<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:21">0:14:21-0:14:29</a>:</strong>  that right now we don't have enough exchangeable nitrogen.  One of the pieces that I see being important  to build exchangeable nitrogen, which you've mentioned,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:29">0:14:29-0:14:34</a>:</strong>  is that we talk about building biology,  but we also have to build a food source for that biology,  which is not just nitrogen,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:34">0:14:34-0:14:39</a>:</strong>  but really the soluble carbon, digestible carbon,  which you referenced a couple of times.  Mm-hmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:39">0:14:39-0:14:44</a>:</strong>  If you go together.  Yep, that makes, yeah, that's why it's perfect sense.  So I go back and I tell the farmers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:44">0:14:44-0:14:50</a>:</strong>  it's really quite simple to manage nitrogen.  You treat a crop that needs nitrogen  like you treat a cow given 100 pounds of milk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:50">0:14:50-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  If you're not a dairy nutritionist,  those guys pretty well got it figured out.  What kind of feed you got to feed that cow?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:15:02</a>:</strong>  Just go search it out.  If you want to grow a legume or a soybean crop,  you feed that like you feed a dry cow or an old beef cow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:02">0:15:02-0:15:09</a>:</strong>  You just kind of keep it around and keeping it alive  and you use less soluble nutrients  because you don't want that animal to have all this gain<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:09">0:15:09-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  and excess energy and digestibility and protein  if she's just not performing well.  So I think if we put that mindset onto the soils<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:22</a>:</strong>  and look at them and quote,  oh, that's a grass or a legume, I don't really care  as much as I do that digestibility,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:22">0:15:22-0:15:29</a>:</strong>  but this is the hardest topic to get across to farmers.  They just don't care.  They have a really hard time grasping this thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:29">0:15:29-0:15:37</a>:</strong>  and I think it's common sense.  And it's so much fun when it starts working.  Yes, it sure is, it sure is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:37">0:15:37-0:15:44</a>:</strong>  Let's talk a little bit about  actual nitrogen applications on commercial farms.  You mentioned stabilizing nitrogen by adding carbon,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:44">0:15:44-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  by adding sulfur, perhaps using ammonium sulfate.  What are some of the common tools that you use  to stabilize nitrogen applications<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  to make sure you get the greatest crop response?  So first of all, if we go to a farmer  and they've been just putting on,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  whether it be urea or even some anhydrous,  we pretty well don't work with too many that do that,  but there's always a few that are hard to wean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:11</a>:</strong>  And if they all say they're just using nitrogen,  the first thing we want to do,  because ammonium sulfate is more of a slow release,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:11">0:16:11-0:16:19</a>:</strong>  time release, there's some carbon with it.  We tell that that you can replace 25 units of your nitrogen  right up front by using sulfur.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:19">0:16:19-0:16:26</a>:</strong>  Both nitrogen and sulfur have a similar effect.  They have that greening effect on plants.  And so whether that's all 100% scientifically in line<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:34</a>:</strong>  with what people think, but we're pretty well convinced  that if a guy's putting on straight urea,  and if I take out a hundred pounds urea,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:34">0:16:34-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  which is 46 units of nitrogen,  and I put in ammonium sulfate,  which if you add the nitrogen and sulfur together, it's 45.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:52</a>:</strong>  21 in nitrogen and 24 sulfur.  So we treat those first hundred pounds ammonium sulfate  as we would a hundred pounds of urea and we just switch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:16:52">0:16:52-0:17:00</a>:</strong>  So now we've reduced this nitrogen,  but we haven't really induced any effect yet.  So then how do I make urea more stable?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:00">0:17:00-0:17:07</a>:</strong>  That's why we struggle with that one a little bit.  So I like to use a little,  our upfront nitrogen preferably is ammonium sulfate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:07">0:17:07-0:17:15</a>:</strong>  If a farmer's not set up to come back and side dress  or do some of the other things we'd like to do,  then we use the ESN and that's that polymer coated urea<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:15">0:17:15-0:17:21</a>:</strong>  cause that gives us a bigger time release  cause we're trying to get,  I don't wanna bathe that thing with nitrogen upfront.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:21">0:17:21-0:17:30</a>:</strong>  Our preferred thing come back and side dressed  and we make a molasses product called Boost,  which is really, it's got a lot of sugars in it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:30">0:17:30-0:17:37</a>:</strong>  some molasses and there's some other things  and there's some yeast and stuff to help stabilize that.  So I'm not one that wants to put an inhibitor in my nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:37">0:17:37-0:17:45</a>:</strong>  cause it doesn't just inhibit that nitrogen transition.  All these chemistries that we add to the soil  have other side effects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:45">0:17:45-0:17:50</a>:</strong>  It's just, it's more to it than,  oh, I'm just gonna slow my nitrogen release  cause it's an anti-biological.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:50">0:17:50-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  I'm uncomfortable with those.  I'd rather put in, I could do some humic acid.  I could put in something that's gonna give that nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  something to bind you.  Now the sugars don't perform like the humic acids.  The humic acids in my opinion are a sponge<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:12</a>:</strong>  and a holder of nitrogen.  Whereas molasses is actually a feeder of biology  and I'm trying and putting a sugar,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:12">0:18:12-0:18:18</a>:</strong>  it's kind of buckling around,  trying to get that nitrogen as fast as I can  into the bodies of bugs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:18">0:18:18-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  And so then I got it stabilized  in a carbon biological cycle.  And then of course we always add some thiosulfate<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:30</a>:</strong>  and make sure we got a little sulfur  cause that helps stabilize that nitrogen.  And then putting on both sides of the row,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:30">0:18:30-0:18:37</a>:</strong>  splitting it out a couple of times is certainly well,  you've seen a lot of farmers now set up to do that.  Having high boys and going in their late season<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:37">0:18:37-0:18:42</a>:</strong>  with their wide drops or whatever they do  to put on a little extra nitrogen  is a way that we can get most efficient<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:42">0:18:42-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  cause they're all worried,  oh, if I don't put a lot on early,  it's gonna get away from me and I'll miss it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:18:51</a>:</strong>  So I think we got tools and equipment  to be able to do that.  Depends on how the farm is set up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:51">0:18:51-0:18:56</a>:</strong>  So I don't know if you have other things  besides the sugars and the humics  that you would add to nitrogen,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:18:56">0:18:56-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  but that's kind of the camp that we stick in.  I think doing nitrogen applications later  when the plants are taller,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  just makes very good agronomic sense  almost irregardless of what you're describing  because how much nitrogen does a six inch tall corn plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  really actually need?  Yep.  And then I tell everybody my story about plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:21</a>:</strong>  and life is this, everything is basically lazy.  And so what'll happen, we get all that nitrogen,  we get this big top lush green growth,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:21">0:19:21-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  but the roots got lazy because all the nutrients were soluble  and they were stuck right next to that four little plants.  So later on, when it runs out,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:33</a>:</strong>  he hasn't built the root base  and we may have burned up some of that carbon  we wanted to save the later,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:33">0:19:33-0:19:38</a>:</strong>  but they haven't really set themselves up for what's coming  because they have no idea.  They go, wow, this is the way the world is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:38">0:19:38-0:19:43</a>:</strong>  I don't need to grow that big,  that bigger, better root system  so I can tap into more things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:43">0:19:43-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  And so that bigger root system now,  the plant puts its exudates in the soil  and is again feeding bacteria,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:54</a>:</strong>  which we should be able to scrounge  and get more nitrogen availability.  And there's not only the root system effect,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:19:54">0:19:54-0:20:00</a>:</strong>  but also the effect on biology,  which you mentioned earlier,  is that when in the case of nitrogen application,<br />

And I think the same thing happens with azotobacter  and other bacteria that are known to have the capacity<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:15">0:20:15-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  that is going to suppress biology.  Yep, that's exactly the way we feel about it also.  Yeah, and to your earlier question about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:26">0:20:26-0:20:35</a>:</strong>  we also use and make recommendations for sulfur  using lots of thiosol in liquid nitrogen applications  and humic acids.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:35">0:20:35-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  We typically use humic acids at about 3% of the solution.  We find that that's enough to really hold and stabilize  the nitrogen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:50</a>:</strong>  Yes, and so on.  Yeah, and we will actually,  because obviously in the molasses,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:50">0:20:50-0:20:56</a>:</strong>  we tell the farmers it's an easy way to do us  in a side dressing 32%.  We'll take, if they're putting on 20 gallons,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:20:56">0:20:56-0:21:05</a>:</strong>  we like to treat the solution and take out 10%.  Now that's about a 30% sugar kind of a thing in that molasses  and there's other things in this water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:05">0:21:05-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  So we actually tell the farmers,  if you're set up the side dress 30 gallons of nitrogen,  and that's what you're gonna do,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:16</a>:</strong>  take out 10% of that solution  and put 10% of this boost molasses mix in  and you'll achieve,<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:29">0:21:29-0:21:37</a>:</strong>  Have you used any molybdenum with the side dress  or are you looking at molybdenum at all  for the effect that it can have on nitrogen in the plant?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:37">0:21:37-0:21:42</a>:</strong>  As a company, we don't really distribute  and work with molybdenum.  Years ago, I put a lot of work and effort into it<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:21:57">0:21:57-0:22:04</a>:</strong>  we'll start putting a starter fertilizer down that road  that's got just NP and K in it.  It's gonna have that little cholesterol mix<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:14">0:22:14-0:22:20</a>:</strong>  like molybdenum and things belong  because I got such a small amount  that they belong in that little trench<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:20">0:22:20-0:22:27</a>:</strong>  when I'm starting that thing out,  some root plant protective kind of compounds.  I think we can do more in that root zone at planting<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:27">0:22:27-0:22:36</a>:</strong>  or that little cholesterol mix zone.  And but as a company, we have not moved into that category.  And now we do use a lot of natural mined materials<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:36">0:22:36-0:22:40</a>:</strong>  for our fertilizers,  which some of them have some of those rare kind  of minerals in them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:40">0:22:40-0:22:46</a>:</strong>  I know one of our topics we're gonna talk about  was trace mentholseed because if you look at the earth  and what's been marketed,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:46">0:22:46-0:22:53</a>:</strong>  whether the companies are real or not,  within the years ago, we had planters and longfoscals  and we had all these different compounds, sulfur plus,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:53">0:22:53-0:22:59</a>:</strong>  I don't know, zeolites are a little bit different,  but these mined materials,  there's certain mines out here that people search for<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:22:59">0:22:59-0:23:08</a>:</strong>  to find those little rare, what's in there after?  Maybe some of those little rare minerals isn't molybdenum.  You actually add it on your guys into the fertilizer mixes?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:08">0:23:08-0:23:17</a>:</strong>  We do and we've observed this very interesting effect  when we're looking at sap analysis,  we've observed that there is this trio<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:17">0:23:17-0:23:24</a>:</strong>  of three different nutrients,  magnesium and sulfur and molybdenum.  When we look at plant saps, we're measuring,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:24">0:23:24-0:23:31</a>:</strong>  we measure ammonium and we measure nitrate  and we measure total nitrogen  and our desire, our goal from a plant health perspective<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:31">0:23:31-0:23:37</a>:</strong>  is to have an adequate or a generous supply  of total nitrogen with a non-detectable  on nitrate and ammonium.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:37">0:23:37-0:23:43</a>:</strong>  We want those numbers to be zero.  Wow.  We can get there very reliably<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:43">0:23:43-0:23:51</a>:</strong>  when we have magnesium and sulfur and molybdenum,  all three at adequate levels,  but if one of them is missing, nitrate levels go up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:52">0:23:52-0:23:59</a>:</strong>  Of course, it's always difficult,  it's a juggling act to get all that exact into that plant  and I guess that's where you got to recognize<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:23:59">0:23:59-0:24:05</a>:</strong>  that a lot of the farmers we work with are,  I'm not being critical or anything,  I'm saying they're in kindergarten<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:05">0:24:05-0:24:12</a>:</strong>  as far as understanding all these things.  If we can just get them to run better sources of minerals  and look at a few more things<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:12">0:24:12-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  and do just a few of these practices  like even putting a cover crop in is a giant step forward.  So whether we take it to this level or not,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:19">0:24:19-0:24:26</a>:</strong>  I think it's gonna go there eventually  and I respect what you're all trying to do,  but I think for the base of the customers we work with,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:26">0:24:26-0:24:36</a>:</strong>  that might be a little more shocking than they can tolerate.  So we've been talking about nitrogen management  and a few moments ago,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:36">0:24:36-0:24:42</a>:</strong>  we were describing humic substances.  One of the pieces that you and I spoke about  in our prior conversation<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:42">0:24:42-0:24:52</a>:</strong>  was the idea of delivering nutrients much more efficiently  and much more effectively using carbon-based fertilizers.  And I think this ties in directly<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:24:52">0:24:52-0:25:00</a>:</strong>  to our nitrogen management conversation  because really what we're talking about  is the need to have a balanced carbon and nitrogen ratio<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:00">0:25:00-0:25:07</a>:</strong>  in the soil profile and to hold that and stabilize it  and keep the plant available.  And how does that concept<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:07">0:25:07-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  of carbon stabilizing nutrients  transfer to other nutrients in addition to nitrogen?  How do you utilize that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:22</a>:</strong>  Yes, and I think back to my little word of digestibility,  that carbon to nitrogen thing,  and we're saying that in order to have the biology<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:22">0:25:22-0:25:27</a>:</strong>  really do its work and break it down,  trace minerals, so what about all the other minerals  and how do we get them available?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:27">0:25:27-0:25:33</a>:</strong>  Some of them are just like that malevolent.  They're pretty small additions.  So how do we take that addition in very small amounts<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:33">0:25:33-0:25:40</a>:</strong>  and make sure we can actually get it plant active  and plant available?  And so balancing carbon and nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:40">0:25:40-0:25:45</a>:</strong>  and just burning up all my carbon,  those nutrients then get lost or mixed  or tied up or hooked somewhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:45">0:25:45-0:25:52</a>:</strong>  So that's the whole other thing with carbon.  I like that whether it be within a plant,  let's say I just put some of this stuff out there<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:52">0:25:52-0:25:59</a>:</strong>  and grow a plant and then manage the digestibility  of that plant, I'm now gonna be more time-released  and I'm gonna be distributed better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:25:59">0:25:59-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  We had a farmer the other day was asking  if he's growing his cover crop now,  if he should put trace minerals on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  I said, the cover crop is not a cover.  It's not covering anything.  It's actually a crop that you're using<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:17</a>:</strong>  to distribute minerals for the next crop  and you're gonna manage it accordingly.  So that nitrogen to carbon ratio comes in line<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:17">0:26:17-0:26:23</a>:</strong>  in terms of digestibility.  If I'm way too high on carbon, low on nitrogen,  it's gonna take a long time to break down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:23">0:26:23-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  I can set myself up for disease in insects  and I don't get my availability of my minerals.  So if I get that high level of mineral uptake,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:38</a>:</strong>  see me as a dairy nutritionist,  that's how I got introduced to some of these things  way back 40 years ago was to create better feed for cows.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:38">0:26:38-0:26:46</a>:</strong>  When we started, I spent nine years at the university  balancing rations based on a set of numbers.  If you turn to get better digestible feed<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:46">0:26:46-0:26:54</a>:</strong>  and the mineral levels in that feed are higher,  that high digestible feed might have 95% of that mineral  available to the cow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:26:54">0:26:54-0:27:02</a>:</strong>  The stuff you buy in stones and bags  might only be 40% available.  So that's where we started balancing rations to cows.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:02">0:27:02-0:27:08</a>:</strong>  I think it's the same thing with soils.  We'd say, look, once you start getting  these high mineralized digestible<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:08">0:27:08-0:27:15</a>:</strong>  and you're managing that just to build those feeds,  you can actually cheat on numbers  and cut down what you apply by at least 25%.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:15">0:27:15-0:27:22</a>:</strong>  So they would back off that ration numbers  with a lot of success once they started getting  this minerals mixed in high digestible feed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:22">0:27:22-0:27:28</a>:</strong>  So in the soil, it would work the same way.  That was why it takes several years  to really get this thing to crank out to the level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:28">0:27:28-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  I know for us as an organic farmer,  the two years in transition from conventional to organic,  all we do is re-mineralize and grow cover crops<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:42</a>:</strong>  to get that soil built up.  So when it is organic, it's always perfect.  But we started this whole thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:42">0:27:42-0:27:47</a>:</strong>  about getting a higher nutrient exchange,  but it's all based on first getting them out there  and then getting them in a form where they go<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:47">0:27:47-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  through their carbon biological cycles  with plants and biology.  Essentially, Gary, what you're describing is<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:28:04</a>:</strong>  farmers should grow their cover crops  as a ration for soil biology,  similar to growing a ration for ruminant biology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:04">0:28:04-0:28:10</a>:</strong>  So in saying that, do you believe that farmers  should manage their cover crops as carefully  and as well as they do their actual crops<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:10">0:28:10-0:28:17</a>:</strong>  that they're growing?  Yes, I think those cover crops need to be treated as,  they are my reserve to hold and release<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:17">0:28:17-0:28:24</a>:</strong>  the kind of minerals that I wanna release.  And so then this guy the other day, he said,  well, I don't, I like using my homogenized trace minerals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:24">0:28:24-0:28:30</a>:</strong>  He said, well, I don't have those available.  He said, what if I went and just sprayed some on  my cover crop?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:30">0:28:30-0:28:35</a>:</strong>  I said, why?  Obviously, whether they get absorbed or where they go,  I think that's certainly not a bad idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:35">0:28:35-0:28:40</a>:</strong>  And then he said, well, can I use a cheaper source of those?  I said, well, they still gotta be able to get  into the plant and I'm not sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:40">0:28:40-0:28:47</a>:</strong>  We like our sulfate trace minerals or our chelates.  I'm not sure how that would really work,  but it starts that process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:47">0:28:47-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  The last thing I want them to do is spend money  and buy something and dump it on the land  and just another stone added to another big pile of stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:28:53">0:28:53-0:29:00</a>:</strong>  that we already got laying in our soil.  Yeah, exactly.  What I can say is what we have observed<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:00">0:29:00-0:29:08</a>:</strong>  is our most successful growers,  those who have regenerated soil health the most rapidly  and have achieved the greatest crop responses,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:08">0:29:08-0:29:13</a>:</strong>  manage their cover crops as carefully  as they do their crops.  And they'll use foliar sprays.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:13">0:29:13-0:29:19</a>:</strong>  They will put on fertilizers.  They will manage those crops as well as they do the crops  that they're actually harvesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:19">0:29:19-0:29:24</a>:</strong>  Yep, I'm 100% in agreement.  That's what I tell people.  I was just at some farms and they had some really poor stands<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:24">0:29:24-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  of alfalfa and their cover crops were half a stand  and they said, we're not getting a success.  I said, but you don't really have a very good cover crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:37</a>:</strong>  or a very good alfalfa stand to work back into the ground  to feed the soil.  If your stand of alfalfa is half gone,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:37">0:29:37-0:29:44</a>:</strong>  so obviously you're not gonna get all the benefits.  I think you're absolutely right.  I think that's a huge ticket to using cover crops<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:44">0:29:44-0:29:49</a>:</strong>  or even our rotation.  See, we as a dairy farm,  we only leave our alfalfa in one or two years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:49">0:29:49-0:29:56</a>:</strong>  We like to take that beautiful lush stand  of alfalfa grasses and let it get up  to that high digestible stage and work it back in the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:29:56">0:29:56-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  And everybody's, oh my gosh, I could feed that to my cows.  And I said, well, I am feeding it to my soil livestock  and they need to be fed just as well as your cows do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah, they certainly do.  And I can imagine that would be difficult  for some farmers to learn how to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:21</a>:</strong>  I had an old neighbor, old farmer, older than me.  I mean, this goes to his 90 and he stopped in one day  and he said, Zimmer, you're gonna wear those soils out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:21">0:30:21-0:30:29</a>:</strong>  You're constantly growing something.  I didn't know what to say.  I said, yeah, but I'm putting it back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:29">0:30:29-0:30:33</a>:</strong>  I'm not taking it all.  And then they got the mentality,  you plant something, you take it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:33">0:30:33-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  So you've spoken a couple of times about trace minerals.  What is the optimal way to apply trace minerals<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:30:48</a>:</strong>  from your perspective to get the greatest crop response?  Yes, so what my whole thing is gonna,  because we're putting on in such small amounts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:48">0:30:48-0:30:53</a>:</strong>  First, we gotta look at sources.  We got our oxides, our sulfates, our chelates,  and then we got them mixed with other things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:30:53">0:30:53-0:31:00</a>:</strong>  And so, see trace minerals in such a small amount  to put a pound of zinc oxide, zinc oxide,  I'm not sure what I get out of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:00">0:31:00-0:31:07</a>:</strong>  Let's just take a better source like sulfate.  I put a pound of the acre.  I got one little crystal of zinc sulfate per square foot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:07">0:31:07-0:31:13</a>:</strong>  Now that's from measurements actually,  but it's kind of crazy.  So then I said, what if I did a homogenized blend<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:13">0:31:13-0:31:21</a>:</strong>  and I took my array of trace minerals,  let's say zinc, manganese, iron, copper, boron,  and we do it in a base of natural rock materials<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:21">0:31:21-0:31:27</a>:</strong>  where there's other minerals like there's nickel,  there's silica, there's all kinds of other things  that are in that source.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:27">0:31:27-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  And then we add humates and we homogenize.  And so that whole mix, every BB's got the same analysis.  Now, if I put on 25 pounds of that per acre,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:42</a>:</strong>  I got the same one pound of zinc, let's say,  but now I got it distributed out here.  So I got 50 of those in that square foot<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:42">0:31:42-0:31:50</a>:</strong>  and I've already got them hooked to a carbon.  So my chances of having them just tied up and gone,  I got better distribution to see now<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:50">0:31:50-0:31:55</a>:</strong>  when I grow my next crop,  I wanna make sure some people say,  well, I tested my next crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:31:55">0:31:55-0:32:01</a>:</strong>  and the level isn't any higher in my crop.  Sometimes they forget the fact  that we've just increased their yield also.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:01">0:32:01-0:32:09</a>:</strong>  So pounds per acre removed might've gone up,  but then in that next crop, see,  now I got those minerals distributed in the stalks<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:09">0:32:09-0:32:14</a>:</strong>  and the residues and as this whole cycle  keeps going round and round,  I over time, I just keep building those numbers up,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:14">0:32:14-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  cycling through carbon,  there's all these levels of minerals have moved up also.  If I'm gonna remove all those,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:20">0:32:20-0:32:29</a>:</strong>  and of course I'm gonna have some issues.  So my whole thing about is these homogenized blends  have been something I've been working on for 30 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:29">0:32:29-0:32:35</a>:</strong>  And then it's about putting them in that base of carbon.  And we also try to control the pH.  We wanna make sure the pH is a little lower in that mix.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:35">0:32:35-0:32:41</a>:</strong>  So around each little bb,  we can keep those analysis higher  cause we're trying to get them exchangeable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:41">0:32:41-0:32:50</a>:</strong>  Gary, this is a fascinating topic for me.  And I'd like to get a little bit of context  and background to some of the work that we've done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:50">0:32:50-0:32:57</a>:</strong>  So we started using SAP analysis  to measure the trace mineral absorption  and nutrient absorption of what crops are actually absorbing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:32:57">0:32:57-0:33:07</a>:</strong>  So the SAP analysis, we measure 22 different parameters  and it is extremely sensitive and very accurate.  It shows very quickly what's happening and what's going on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:07">0:33:07-0:33:13</a>:</strong>  And when we put on an application  that the plants actually absorb,  the needle moves very quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:13">0:33:13-0:33:23</a>:</strong>  So about 2012 or 13, somewhere in there,  we're working in Southeastern Pennsylvania  where there's calcareous soils, limestone based soils<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:23">0:33:23-0:33:33</a>:</strong>  with pH of 7.2, 7.4, sometimes higher.  And there's challenges with chronic manganese deficiencies.  Historically, growers have been applying manganese sulfate<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:33">0:33:33-0:33:42</a>:</strong>  as a dry soil broadcast or even as a foliar spray.  And we thought we were getting crop responses  when we're using tissue analysis,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:42">0:33:42-0:33:51</a>:</strong>  we would see the tissue analysis levels increase.  When we started using SAP analysis,  all of a sudden we realized that even the manganese sulfate<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:33:57</a>:</strong>  foliar sprays were not being absorbed effectively.  They were still on the outside of the leaf,  but they weren't actually being absorbed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:33:57">0:33:57-0:34:04</a>:</strong>  As a result of that,  several different growers that we've been working with  out there, we did experiments where they,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:04">0:34:04-0:34:18</a>:</strong>  we blended manganese sulfate in with humified compost  and we applied it at different plots of rates of 20 pounds,  40 pounds, 100 pounds, 200 and 400 pounds per acre<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:18">0:34:18-0:34:24</a>:</strong>  of manganese sulfate,  the small plots on an experimental basis  to observe the plant response.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:30</a>:</strong>  How much do you think the manganese increased  on those small plots,  even where we applied 400 pounds per acre?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:39</a>:</strong>  I got to feel that one probably is greatly different  as one would think.  Not a single point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:39">0:34:39-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  There was no manganese absorption  from the applied manganese to the soil  when it was applied with compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:34:55</a>:</strong>  We measured plant absorption for three years  after the application and there was not on a single crop,  was there an actual crop response or plant absorption?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:34:55">0:34:55-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  And I have a couple of ideas of why that is  and why that was going on,  but I'd like to ask you the question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:03">0:35:03-0:35:08</a>:</strong>  Your carbon-based fertilizers and your homogenous blends,  you mentioned a couple of different pieces  that I think are important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:08">0:35:08-0:35:17</a>:</strong>  How are those different from what I described  and how are you able to get those plant responses?  Right, so now you used a humified compost to put them in<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:17">0:35:17-0:35:22</a>:</strong>  and we tried to put them to a sponge  that would hold onto them.  I think here's the whole thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:22">0:35:22-0:35:29</a>:</strong>  Let's go back to even the testing on trace minerals  and I think some of your comments that came through loud,  you're like, oh, you're feeding manganese<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:29">0:35:29-0:35:33</a>:</strong>  and doing a tissue test.  Yes, it might come up because it's on the outside.  You just put it there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:39</a>:</strong>  It all got washed off.  But my whole thing is this,  that every soil and every biology and every tillage<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:39">0:35:39-0:35:45</a>:</strong>  and every farm is kind of different  on how they see and perceive things.  Your soil has a certain ability to dish out minerals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:45">0:35:45-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  And so then if we dump down three, 400 pounds an acre,  there's interactions and there's other things happening.  So now you've got that mineral in the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:57</a>:</strong>  It tied up with something and went somewhere,  but did not necessarily go into the plant.  Was that a good or a bad thing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:35:57">0:35:57-0:36:02</a>:</strong>  Now, if we go to soil testing,  manganese is one that I'm most critical of,  but soil testing,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:02">0:36:02-0:36:08</a>:</strong>  these things are just giving us a little bit of clues  and maybe your SAP analysis is more accurate.  My thing on the SAP analysis,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:08">0:36:08-0:36:13</a>:</strong>  and I'll let you address it here,  is that you got to do it on a lot of basis  because the weather changes, the day changes,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:19</a>:</strong>  the plant maturity changes, there's interactions  of how long ago I put my fertilizers on  and all these other things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:19">0:36:19-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  But manganese is one of those minerals  that to me is a biological mineral.  Because we're dairy people,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  we're constantly testing our feeds.  Our feeds are more than double in manganese.  So it's more than double in my feeds<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:35</a>:</strong>  than what average feed would have,  like alfalfa for a dairy cow.  And of course, years ago,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:35">0:36:35-0:36:40</a>:</strong>  I tell people that's why my father fed oats to cows.  He didn't understand,  but oats are a good source of manganese<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:40">0:36:40-0:36:45</a>:</strong>  because they're a fairly acidic plant  and they can take out manganese where others can't.  So then that gets in that oats.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:45">0:36:45-0:36:52</a>:</strong>  So that manganese is double in our feeds,  but my soil test, if I sent it in,  it says it's low in manganese.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:52">0:36:52-0:36:57</a>:</strong>  Now putting on more doesn't necessarily drive up more.  So I tell people,  that's why you do have to really look at the plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:36:57">0:36:57-0:37:04</a>:</strong>  because we're testing a lot of feed for our cows.  So manganese on the chemistry extraction from a soil  shows low and it might be not,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:04">0:37:04-0:37:11</a>:</strong>  maybe I don't have a big reserve out there.  Now we'll add a small amount every year  because that gives more than what my soil can dish out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:11">0:37:11-0:37:18</a>:</strong>  But because there's a biological link and really strong,  I think on both phosphorus and manganese  and maybe some others,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:18">0:37:18-0:37:24</a>:</strong>  I got a huge uptake of manganese in the plant.  So that's really what I'm after  because that's one of the signs to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:24">0:37:24-0:37:30</a>:</strong>  That's one way to measure good biological activity  is by watching manganese.  I couldn't agree more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:30">0:37:30-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  When you said that manganese is a biological mineral,  it's one of the things that we've observed  is that manganese and phosphorus and iron as well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:44</a>:</strong>  cobalt, copper,  the quantity that is absorbed by the plant  is in direct correlation to the level of biological<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:44">0:37:44-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  integrity and biological soil health.  Biology trumps chemistry.  You can have really screwed up chemistry in the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:55</a>:</strong>  and as long as you have good biology,  you can overcome that to some degree.  But the opposite doesn't really be true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:37:55">0:37:55-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  And that's why I think if you look at research out here now,  your little plots here using humified compost,  which should have been some biological food and things,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  but what was the biological activity  and balance within those soils?  And that's when you go to university research,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:15</a>:</strong>  you've got to go to their farms and look around.  If their soils are really dead and yours are not,  and you're a farmer and you're just down the road<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:15">0:38:15-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  and yours got a different biologic  and you're growing different varieties of crops  and cover crops and you're doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:24</a>:</strong>  some really positive things out there,  not using all these negative inhibitors  and pesticides that go on and on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:24">0:38:24-0:38:31</a>:</strong>  The list goes just because they did the research  at their farm doesn't necessarily help you.  That's very true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:32">0:38:32-0:38:39</a>:</strong>  Gary, why use trace minerals?  Why the emphasis on manganese and zinc and boron  and all these various trace minerals?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:45</a>:</strong>  What do they do for you from a crop quality  and health perspective?  So I'll back up just a little bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:45">0:38:45-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  because we were talking about nitrogen.  See when we added the sugars or the molasses  to the nitrogen, we were trading dollars.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  We took some of the nitrogen away  and we put some carbon with it.  When we're taking our insecticides or our fungicides,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:39:02</a>:</strong>  we trade dollars on nitrogen.  We trade dollars on a phosphorus starter fertilizer.  We take some of that out and we put our sugars in its place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:02">0:39:02-0:39:09</a>:</strong>  When we go to add in these trace minerals  in today's world of economy, we just added a cost.  They are not cheap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:09">0:39:09-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  And if you go out to buy them, they're very expensive.  So now to a farmer, I gotta live within their budget.  So how do I shuffle dollars out of the farmer?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:16">0:39:16-0:39:26</a>:</strong>  Or I'm gonna have to expect a huge increase in yield  when I think another really hard message  to get across to farmers is the fact that plant health<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:26">0:39:26-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  is really related to a balance of minerals  and trace minerals are huge for fungal diseases  and insect pressures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:39</a>:</strong>  On our farm, we live right in an area,  we've never seen the need for an insecticide.  There's a lot of corn dying from fungal disease out here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:39">0:39:39-0:39:46</a>:</strong>  We see very little activity of that on our farm.  So part of that is that excess nitrogen  you suck up in that plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:46">0:39:46-0:39:52</a>:</strong>  And I'm sure you've been a lot of time, probably more  than I have studying that looking at this DHism,  what were the fungal diseases set up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:52">0:39:52-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  The trace minerals are huge.  And we've got a lot of evidence from farms.  And we actually did some research<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:40:03</a>:</strong>  at the University of Wisconsin on corn  and we put our homogenized trace minerals on there  and just testing the trace minerals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:03">0:40:03-0:40:09</a>:</strong>  Well, they put it on a field  where they didn't use any biotechnology  because they thought we didn't wanna use it, which we don't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:09">0:40:09-0:40:16</a>:</strong>  But the corn was just diseased and brown.  And we had a huge response from just a small amount  of trace minerals out of it<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:16">0:40:16-0:40:24</a>:</strong>  because we really stopped the diseases.  So for a farmer, they've got to recognize that  as we get this, because of health and benefits and enzymes<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:24">0:40:24-0:40:29</a>:</strong>  and where do trace minerals fit in there?  All those regulatory things within a plant  that actually promote health,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:29">0:40:29-0:40:35</a>:</strong>  stimulate its immune system,  stimulate its ability to protect itself.  I guess we'd wanna say so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:35">0:40:35-0:40:40</a>:</strong>  When you start spending money on trace minerals,  you should be able to take the money away  from insecticides, fungicides, pesticides<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:40">0:40:40-0:40:47</a>:</strong>  and biotechnology to pay for it.  But you can't say that to a farmer right up front  because he has to earn the right to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:47">0:40:47-0:40:54</a>:</strong>  That should be his goal.  I was at a huge Hutterite colony in South Dakota last week.  They dropped all their insecticides.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:54">0:40:54-0:40:58</a>:</strong>  Now they're growing huge cover crops.  They got livestock involved.  They're doing better balanced fertility<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:40:58">0:40:58-0:41:05</a>:</strong>  and they've cut their nitrogen's way down.  They've taken their soybean yields up by over 20 bushel  on just 20 inches of rain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:05">0:41:05-0:41:10</a>:</strong>  One soybean plant with 508 pods on.  It's unbelievable.  Since their biology has really changed,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:10">0:41:10-0:41:17</a>:</strong>  they've dropped all their biotechnology  and they're slowly getting rid of all the chemistry.  So all that money now I can make up by buying nutrition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:17">0:41:17-0:41:23</a>:</strong>  I'm going to make my livestock and things better,  make my soils better in the future.  So that's the hard one to be able to stay<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:23">0:41:23-0:41:30</a>:</strong>  within the farmer's budget with the day's economy.  Cause that takes time and we just can't say,  look, drop all your biotechnology<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:30">0:41:30-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  and insecticides, fungicides  and put our trace for us on cause I don't know,  maybe your experiences are different,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:40</a>:</strong>  but this doesn't always work 100% that way.  I think that's one of the strengths  that we've observed with sap analysis is that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:40">0:41:40-0:41:46</a>:</strong>  yes, we do have to be on top of it and manage it.  Like you have to manage a dairy ration.  You have to measure constantly throughout the growing season<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:46">0:41:46-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  but you can actually be very accurate  and predict what's happening and what's going on.  We have had successes quite consistently in the first year<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:03</a>:</strong>  when we started working with a grower.  And we've done a lot of work in Southwest Kansas,  working with commodity crops, corn and soybeans<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:03">0:42:03-0:42:09</a>:</strong>  in these very hot, dry environments  with both irrigated and dry land corn.  And one of the things that we've observed<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:09">0:42:09-0:42:14</a>:</strong>  with trace minerals,  when growers begin applying trace minerals,  the great majority of the time,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:14">0:42:14-0:42:20</a>:</strong>  we cut out the miticide applications.  Well, you're talking a miticide application  that costs $40 an acre and you apply it once or twice,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:20">0:42:20-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  all of a sudden you can afford trace minerals really easily.  Yes.  And I agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:30</a>:</strong>  Now we got to whether I put those trace minerals,  we did a lot of work.  I think that's done quite a bit over in Australia<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:30">0:42:30-0:42:34</a>:</strong>  where they put all these trace minerals  in their compost pile.  They put a lot of minerals and things in their compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:34">0:42:34-0:42:40</a>:</strong>  Well, hopefully that can really work.  There's all kinds of ways to do it.  We also got to recognize that health and insect pressure<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:40">0:42:40-0:42:46</a>:</strong>  also gets a little bit out of repurposed diseases.  Phosphorus uptake is huge.  We got to get a high levels of phosphorus uptake.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:46">0:42:46-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  We got to make sure we got a nitrogen  and sulfur ratios in line.  We got to make sure we got adequate levels of calcium uptake<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  and we got to have these ratios between those minerals.  If you have really high potassium levels  and low magnesium, all those things stress a plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:04</a>:</strong>  So the trace minerals are a piece of it,  but there's more pieces to the puzzle.  That's why this is a system<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:04">0:43:04-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  and we have to put that whole system in place.  When you do your sap test and do this kind of thing,  are you doing it at critical or certain stages<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  throughout the season?  Is that your approach?  Yes, we're doing it at critical stages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:24</a>:</strong>  And if we're doing it for research to,  or in field research to try to get an understanding  of what is happening with that crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:24">0:43:24-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  throughout the entire season,  we'll do it once every 14 days.  And that can be incredibly revealing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:30">0:43:30-0:43:36</a>:</strong>  You learn an awful lot about a crop and a soil system  and how it's really functioning  and how you can manage it better in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:36">0:43:36-0:43:41</a>:</strong>  If you do that just for one year on one crop,  you'll learn a lot about  what's really happening on your farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:41">0:43:41-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  That makes perfect sense.  And that to me, I think the farmers right now  are kind of down in the mouth and understandable<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:54</a>:</strong>  and kind of bummed out, how do I pay my bills?  I think the fun and excitement in farming  is doing some of the things you're talking about<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:43:54">0:43:54-0:44:00</a>:</strong>  and some of the things I'm talking about here  is to get back and take charge of their farm.  Otherwise I think they feel like<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:00">0:44:00-0:44:07</a>:</strong>  they're just kind of a slave to agribusiness out here  and they got all the fancy new stuff.  But the fun in farming is getting this whole thing to work<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:07">0:44:07-0:44:13</a>:</strong>  and that's the part they kind of probably miss.  Yeah.  So Gary, one of the conversations that we've been<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:13">0:44:13-0:44:20</a>:</strong>  kind of circling around all these pieces  when we spoke about nitrogen management  and carbon and nitrogen and carbon-based fertilizers<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:20">0:44:20-0:44:28</a>:</strong>  is the importance of biology,  importance of having manganese and phosphorus  delivered by biology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:28">0:44:28-0:44:36</a>:</strong>  How do we regenerate soil microbial communities  after they've been severely compromised  by challenging farm management practices, et cetera?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:36">0:44:36-0:44:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and that was why I mentioned a little bit earlier,  she asked when we take on land,  we just took on some more land, the other 300 acres<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:43">0:44:43-0:44:48</a>:</strong>  and we're transitioning.  I want to tell you, it was pretty dead.  It was in pretty bad shape<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:48">0:44:48-0:44:53</a>:</strong>  and had not been fertilized very well,  been rented for numbers and numbers of years  and everybody took whatever they could<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:44:53">0:44:53-0:45:00</a>:</strong>  with putting a little back they possibly could.  So yes, we did revitalize.  And maybe it's not capable of everybody to do this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:00">0:45:00-0:45:03</a>:</strong>  First I'll say the organic guys,  I think this is just such a beautiful  two year period of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:03">0:45:03-0:45:08</a>:</strong>  And everybody's, how can you afford to do that?  And I said, how can you afford not to do that  because they yield?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:08">0:45:08-0:45:13</a>:</strong>  So we go out and take our soil tests  and we always start with calcium and phosphorus,  drive our calcium and phosphorus levels,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:13">0:45:13-0:45:17</a>:</strong>  make sure they're in line.  And then we start doing these cover crops,  shallow incorporating them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:17">0:45:17-0:45:23</a>:</strong>  And we just kept feeding the soil.  Yes, I'd like to be able to put on compost  and yes, I'd love to have some livestock manure<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:23">0:45:23-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  if it's available.  I do like my dairy manure.  If you look in the world of biologicals,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:34</a>:</strong>  a lot of our extracted from cattle punch material,  certain biologists and certain chemistries  because that's a pre-digestion going on,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:34">0:45:34-0:45:39</a>:</strong>  which you're not going to necessarily get  out of chicken manure or hog manure,  that old fermentation bat within a cow<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:39">0:45:39-0:45:45</a>:</strong>  and some other wonderful things, these digestate stuff  because we use a lot of manure coming out  of anaerobic digester on dairy farms<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:45">0:45:45-0:45:54</a>:</strong>  as our base for our fertilizers.  So all these little things to regenerate that soil,  would I go out there and spray a biology or a bug?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:45:54">0:45:54-0:46:01</a>:</strong>  Ah, I haven't and I know there's a lot of people  selling bugs in the jug out here  and maybe they have their place<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:01">0:46:01-0:46:07</a>:</strong>  and maybe there's some special unique ones,  but me, I want to change that whole system.  So organic, then I got those two years<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:07">0:46:07-0:46:11</a>:</strong>  and put everything back in the soil.  So then when it is certified organic,  I hit a home run the first year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:11">0:46:11-0:46:20</a>:</strong>  I mean, it just, we grow some seed corn out here  and we can get our 200 bushel corn that first year at $10.  The bushel covers all my losses there in those two years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:20">0:46:20-0:46:26</a>:</strong>  And you also got to recognize that 300 acres,  taking on 300 acres, we farm 1500.  It's not a whole farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:26">0:46:26-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  We're not sacrificing a whole farm.  Oh, that's a big cost, don't get me wrong.  But next year that's organic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:39</a>:</strong>  It's kind of all exciting because we get a high return  for a couple of years of high pay crops.  We rent that land that we fix and the landlords,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:39">0:46:39-0:46:46</a>:</strong>  the owners, they are just in shock at what we do.  But I do get a seven year rent of two years to transition  and five years to farm it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:46">0:46:46-0:46:51</a>:</strong>  We've never lost a piece of land yet that we've taken on  because they like what we do to it  and how we change that thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:51">0:46:51-0:46:59</a>:</strong>  So now let's go to a guy that corn beans,  corn beans and chemistry.  It's a real struggle because of where the cover crops<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:46:59">0:46:59-0:47:05</a>:</strong>  even fit in.  They have to be kind of committed.  I maybe can bring on some compost or some livestock.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:05">0:47:05-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  I need to get so I don't have so much bare soil  and I'm more of a fibrous rich system.  I need to get plants and food out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:17</a>:</strong>  Can I do that all with compost?  I can make progress.  But until I get, whether it be another crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:17">0:47:17-0:47:22</a>:</strong>  or these guys down in Illinois,  I see everybody's out of rye.  The rye is all gone, the rye seeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:22">0:47:22-0:47:27</a>:</strong>  So more people are doing it.  And rye is the only thing that you can plant late.  It's not everybody's favorite thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:27">0:47:27-0:47:37</a>:</strong>  But how do I fit that in?  Us organic guys, the inner seed corn with the cover crop  really doesn't work very well because we plant later<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:37">0:47:37-0:47:43</a>:</strong>  and because we make a cultivation  when the corn is knee high.  If I planted my corn earlier<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:43">0:47:43-0:47:50</a>:</strong>  and when it's six, eight inches tall,  now hopefully my chemical herbicides won't interfere with it  I would then drill my cover crop in between the rows<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:50">0:47:50-0:47:56</a>:</strong>  to get it established early May.  Us organic guys, that would be mid June  and it's so hot and dry<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:47:56">0:47:56-0:48:02</a>:</strong>  but then the cover crops don't make it  and the corn's too big and it shades it out.  I gotta be committed to have a diversity of plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:02">0:48:02-0:48:09</a>:</strong>  and something to recycle those nutrients  and something for that biology to live on.  Otherwise bugs in the jug, I was out in the coat<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:09">0:48:09-0:48:15</a>:</strong>  as these guys seem to be happy with $20 an acre  worth of bugs in the jug.  I said, you're not gonna ever get away from this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:15">0:48:15-0:48:20</a>:</strong>  This is an addiction that now you're spending $20 an acre  for the rest of your life  because you're not doing anything<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:20">0:48:20-0:48:28</a>:</strong>  to have them grow on their own.  Yeah, our experience has been, we use microbial inoculants.  We've seen a lot of successes with them<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:28">0:48:28-0:48:34</a>:</strong>  with one qualification, biology still needs a food source.  And I think everything that you're talking about,  cover crops and developing this whole system<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:34">0:48:34-0:48:41</a>:</strong>  is all about developing the soluble carbon  in the soil profile they can use as a food source.  The food source is the biggest limiting factor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:41">0:48:41-0:48:45</a>:</strong>  It's not oxygen, it's not water, it's food.  It's food.  On a lot of farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:45">0:48:45-0:48:51</a>:</strong>  And I think that's the piece  that you're really talking about  is adding microbial inoculants and bugs in the jug<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:51">0:48:51-0:48:59</a>:</strong>  and adding all these pieces, it's a temporary fix.  You have to fix the entire system  so that that population desires to live there on its own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:48:59">0:48:59-0:49:08</a>:</strong>  Yep, and you can make progress on a farm on soil health  just like right behind that combine  just spray on, like you said, a biological,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:08">0:49:08-0:49:14</a>:</strong>  that's more of a fungal kind of  because you've got a complex carbon, old dead corn stalks  and a little bit of nitrogen and some biology,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:14">0:49:14-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  a little bit sugar can really improve that digestion  and you can help to start improve your soils.  But that's really just a small piece<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:25</a>:</strong>  because you still have one food source  that's complex carbon.  So I don't have enough soluble carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:25">0:49:25-0:49:32</a>:</strong>  Now, that's why, see Michigan State years ago  did research on interseeding that corn  and eight out of 10 or six out of 10 years<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:32">0:49:32-0:49:38</a>:</strong>  having that cover crop going in their corn  improve their yields of corn.  And they were saying, how is that possible?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:38">0:49:38-0:49:43</a>:</strong>  I said, because that thing is photosynthesizing  and putting its exudates down in the soil  to feed the biology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:43">0:49:43-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  The biology feeds the plants.  And so I can get those sugars  and maybe some of our humus has built out of those sugars.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:55</a>:</strong>  So you think, well, I'm robbing moisture  and I'm robbing nutrients, but you're giving back  because the plants give back a fair bit into the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:49:55">0:49:55-0:49:59</a>:</strong>  to make this work.  How else do I get these soluble carbohydrates  to work within my soil?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:00">0:50:00-0:50:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.  Which reminds me of something,  I had some experiences recently that reminded me<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:05">0:50:05-0:50:14</a>:</strong>  of a Gary Zimmer quote that I heard many, many years ago.  Something to the effect that we generally tend  to misdiagnose what is actually happening,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:14">0:50:14-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  what's actually going on.  Can you refresh my memory on what that quote was?  Oh gosh, yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:21">0:50:21-0:50:25</a>:</strong>  50% of the time, I always say,  when we see and observe something,  we give the credit to the wrong thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:25">0:50:25-0:50:30</a>:</strong>  and we blame the wrong thing.  50% of the time, I don't care who you are,  research your scientists.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:30">0:50:30-0:50:35</a>:</strong>  So you gotta always take that with a grain of salt  because your observation, they might have a,  it's got a chain reaction that took place<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:35">0:50:35-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  way long time before that.  50% of the time, that's a really big,  that's a big proportion of the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:40">0:50:40-0:50:46</a>:</strong>  That's a big proportion of the times.  What I always want people to,  not to get hung up on one little piece of research,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:46">0:50:46-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  I want them to focus on a system  and all those things that can be taken  with a grain of salt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:50">0:50:50-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  And yes, there's tools out there today  and understandings we never had years ago.  I said, my grandfather wasn't a biological farmer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:51:01</a>:</strong>  He didn't understand.  He was in battle with weeds.  He didn't understand fertility and all these little,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:06</a>:</strong>  he didn't understand why he plowed.  And he was certainly,  he wasn't using a lot of harsh chemistries,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:06">0:51:06-0:51:11</a>:</strong>  but he was not necessarily doing all good things  for his soil either  because they were always in battle with something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:11">0:51:11-0:51:16</a>:</strong>  Yeah, we've come a long ways.  We've learned a lot of things the last couple of decades.  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:16">0:51:16-0:51:22</a>:</strong>  And I was at a meeting in Illinois,  right down by Peoria, Illinois,  in a heart of corn and bean ground, that $12,000 acre,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:22">0:51:22-0:51:28</a>:</strong>  black soils that I don't know how they're going to pay  for my 10% interest when it gets there.  But anyway, another story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:28">0:51:28-0:51:34</a>:</strong>  And down those beautiful, rich black soils  at the meeting, there was at a farm  and it was kind of,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:34">0:51:34-0:51:40</a>:</strong>  they were at least biological companies  selling their bugs in a jug.  And not a single one,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:40">0:51:40-0:51:45</a>:</strong>  they just wanted you to buy their bugs and spray them out.  Not a single one was ever talking about a system.  Because I had, you know, me on it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:45">0:51:45-0:51:50</a>:</strong>  and I was joking and teasing around.  And I said, all you guys,  if you're going to go buy those bugs in a jug,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:50">0:51:50-0:51:54</a>:</strong>  maybe you ought to talk to us first  and set the conditions up  so they have a chance of making it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:51:54">0:51:54-0:52:01</a>:</strong>  I can imagine Gary doing that very well,  because I remember, I recall Gary giving me  a hard time years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:05">0:52:05-0:52:12</a>:</strong>  I would have done that job.  I like to challenge people's thinking.  And sometimes you gotta be rattled a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:12">0:52:12-0:52:17</a>:</strong>  And I've earned the right to do that.  Cause see, I've been around a long time.  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:17">0:52:17-0:52:25</a>:</strong>  Gary, what other topics are important for us to talk about?  Well, I think we covered on this nitrogen thing,  which brought on a lot of this carbon-based fertilizer<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:25">0:52:25-0:52:32</a>:</strong>  kind of a thing, and these sources of nutrients,  and when and how we add them.  And I tell people out here,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:32">0:52:32-0:52:39</a>:</strong>  we got this other movement going on in agriculture  that, you know, this regenerative thing  where they absolutely think that, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:39">0:52:39-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  you don't really need fertilizers.  You got enough reserve in the soil,  you can pull them back out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:48</a>:</strong>  And I think you and I both know  there's certain nutrients like salt,  for available calcium and boron<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  that might not work real well without ever adding them  cause they're anions and they leach.  But I think we get distorted views.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:53:01</a>:</strong>  Now that system I kind of find really interesting  cause they say you got a no-till  and you got to have livestock.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:01">0:53:01-0:53:08</a>:</strong>  Cause if you no-till and you got all these residues out here  that someone's got to break and digest them down  so they graze them in the winter time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:08">0:53:08-0:53:13</a>:</strong>  Well, they're in a place in the Nicodas  where they get 20 inches of rain.  Now let's go where you get 40 inches of rain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:13">0:53:13-0:53:19</a>:</strong>  There's a neighbor of ours that started to graze cattle.  We had this 10 inches of rain two weeks ago.  He never took them off the pastures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:19">0:53:19-0:53:25</a>:</strong>  How long do you think this is going to work?  So we always got these different systems out here.  And so I think some of the topics we covered<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:25">0:53:25-0:53:30</a>:</strong>  is how this management fits in it  and how they got to treat that soil  as this living live entity and make sure that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:30">0:53:30-0:53:37</a>:</strong>  would you leave your cows out on a pasture  for several days when it just rained 10 inches?  Or would you lock them up off that field<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:37">0:53:37-0:53:43</a>:</strong>  and give that chance back?  They've destroyed that field for a long time, in my opinion.  So that management part of it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:43">0:53:43-0:53:50</a>:</strong>  they got to really understand us and say,  how do they put this management end together on that farm?  And they got to be able to understand where they're going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:50">0:53:50-0:53:56</a>:</strong>  I think it's like I said,  they just automatically think that diseases show up.  Oh, the population of bugs in the county<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:53:56">0:53:56-0:54:01</a>:</strong>  are really high this week.  I was over in England at a conference  and they developed a meter<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:01">0:54:01-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  that you can put on the corner of your farm.  And when the spore levels get so high  on certain fungal disease,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:12</a>:</strong>  they want you to go out and spray.  And now, I'm at the conference, I just couldn't keep quiet.  I stood up and said,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:12">0:54:12-0:54:18</a>:</strong>  I just came over on a plane.  If one of those sat in the corner of the plane,  I'm pretty sure I'd be on antibiotics today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:18">0:54:18-0:54:23</a>:</strong>  And yet I have an immune system  and I don't take antibiotics unless I absolutely need to.  And I'm not sick today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:23">0:54:23-0:54:28</a>:</strong>  And so everybody laughed kind of,  because it just seems like,  how do we get them to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:28">0:54:28-0:54:33</a>:</strong>  that this system was designed to work  and when everything is in its little place,  we should have healthy, high producing crops<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:33">0:54:33-0:54:39</a>:</strong>  without having to spend all our money  on plant protective things that never make my farm better.  And they have terrible side effects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:39">0:54:39-0:54:44</a>:</strong>  How do we get that little discussion  is the one that there's a certain topics  that are really hard to get through people's head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:44">0:54:44-0:54:51</a>:</strong>  Like we talked about nitrogen numbers and credits,  understanding that health is something you can achieve  without putting an insecticide or a fungus on<br />

There's certain things they gotta believe and understand.  And yet there'll be bumps and obstacles in the road<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:54:58">0:54:58-0:55:03</a>:</strong>  and they can use those tools if needed,  but they don't have to depend upon them.  I think what's exciting about agriculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:03">0:55:03-0:55:09</a>:</strong>  is there's so much pressure being put on  the chemistry companies,  whether it's Bayer or Monsanto or whoever it is,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:09">0:55:09-0:55:16</a>:</strong>  all these different companies  that are coming out with huge amount of more safer  control agents, whether it be for fungal diseases<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:16">0:55:16-0:55:23</a>:</strong>  or for insects or whether they be for whatever.  I think they're coming out with safer kind of things  to be able to handle and put on our land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:23">0:55:23-0:55:31</a>:</strong>  Now, herbicides are a really big battle out here.  People are having much, much stronger, harsher herbicides.  Those weeds wanna survive on this planet also,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:31">0:55:31-0:55:40</a>:</strong>  and they're gonna come back against us no matter what we do.  So we better learn how to live with them in a system.  Mother nature always bats last and she always wins.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:40">0:55:40-0:55:47</a>:</strong>  I know, isn't that terrible?  Or not.  It's always designed to get rid of the sick<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:47">0:55:47-0:55:51</a>:</strong>  and the undesirable too.  So if you got a disease out there,  what's the reason for the disease?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:51">0:55:51-0:55:56</a>:</strong>  It must be sick and undesirable.  Exactly.  Gary, it's been a pleasure having you here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:55:56">0:55:56-0:56:01</a>:</strong>  I've really enjoyed this conversation  and found it very delightful  and I'm sure that our audience will as well.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:56:10">0:56:10-0:56:15</a>:</strong>  I've done all my things.  I'm getting up there and belonging to tooth as they say.  So I've been around a while,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:56:15">0:56:15-0:56:21</a>:</strong>  but I sure enjoy all your knowledge  and all the work you guys do out here that are anybody.  Just even listen to this podcast to say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:56:21">0:56:21-0:56:26</a>:</strong>  I know it might not be easy, but it is the right path.  Absolutely.  So thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:56:26">0:56:26-0:56:31</a>:</strong>  Thank you, Gary.  This podcast was brought to you  by a great company that I work for,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:56:31">0:56:31-0:56:39</a>:</strong>  AEA, Advancing Eco-Agriculture,  the leader in regenerative agriculture since 2006.  At AEA, we believe in challenging the status quo<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:56:39">0:56:39-0:56:46</a>:</strong>  to find more profitable and regenerative ways to grow crops.  We also believe that healthy plants  are resistant to pest and disease<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:56:46">0:56:46-0:56:53</a>:</strong>  and that to grow healthy crops,  we must first think different about agriculture,  about empowering life instead of suppressing life,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:56:53">0:56:53-0:57:00</a>:</strong>  about regeneration versus degeneration.  To achieve this, we formulate and sell products  that help growers produce higher quality yield<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/practice-of-biological-farming-with-gary-zimmer/#t=0:57:00">0:57:00-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  with less risk of crop failure.  In short, we help growers make more money with less risk.  Thanks for listening.  </p>
