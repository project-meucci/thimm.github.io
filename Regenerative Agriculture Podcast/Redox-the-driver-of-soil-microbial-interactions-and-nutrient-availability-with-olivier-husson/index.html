Welcome back to the Regenerative Agriculture Podcast.  In this episode, I am delighted to host Olivier Husson, who has been one of my heroes for<br />

Within this context, I was really interested in learning more about redox and soil, EH<br />

In the literature review, I was not able to find very good information except for one  source.<br />

So Olivier has written a number of papers on the importance of redox and EH as drivers  of the soil microbial ecosystem and soil and plant interactions.<br />

So Olivier, welcome to the podcast.  You have a very interesting background.<br />

First, yes, let me say that I'm very proud to be asked and very glad to participate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:34">0:01:34-0:01:43</a>:</strong>  I'm a big fan of your work, James.  So it's a really, really pleasure.  I'm an agronomist, French agronomist.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:43">0:01:43-0:01:55</a>:</strong>  I've been working in the tropics for more than 25 years.  And one of the main crop I've been working with was rice.  And rice can be grown in very different conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:01:55">0:01:55-0:02:18</a>:</strong>  It can be grown, as most people know, with water in the field, in the paddy field.  But it can also be grown as wheat and plant aerobic crop as any other crop.  And I've been working on developing cropping system based on conservation agriculture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:18">0:02:18-0:02:33</a>:</strong>  regenerative agriculture.  And I've been working my early time for my PhD, especially in paddy fields where redox  chemistry is really fundamental and is very well known.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:33">0:02:33-0:02:54</a>:</strong>  So I asked myself why redox chemistry is so important in paddy field in anaerobic condition.  And it would not be important in a plant aerobic field.  And I started about 10 years ago to work on this aspect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:02:54">0:02:54-0:03:07</a>:</strong>  And it's been quite interesting work.  And then we can apply this to more aerobic crops, the most crops we have usually in our  systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:07">0:03:07-0:03:23</a>:</strong>  Olivier, there is a common perception that pH is one of the most important factors for  managing soil nutrient availability.  And yet I've observed many environments and many fields where the pH was not where we<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:23">0:03:23-0:03:36</a>:</strong>  might have had expected it to be, but we had very good or very bad nutrient availability.  That was really what led me to look at redox.  What is the impact of redox on nutrient availability from the soil?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:36">0:03:36-0:03:51</a>:</strong>  I would say it's probably as important as pH.  pH, of course, is a key factor for nutrient solubility, but it's not the only one.  And if we look only at pH, we miss about half of the picture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:03:51">0:03:51-0:04:09</a>:</strong>  In fact, we really need to assess both pH and redox potential at the same time.  So redox potential is a measurement of the availability of the electrons as pH is a measurement  of the availability of protons.<br />

I've actually, or people have asked me that question, I've said that understanding redox<br />

And one of the questions that comes up frequently, what is the impact of redox on nitrogen availability  specifically?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:05:08</a>:</strong>  You have both an impact of EH, redox potential and pH.  In fact, the main component related nitrogen availability would be the oxygen and the hydrogen.  So it's crossing at 45 degrees between pH and redox.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:05:08">0:05:08-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  It's really the gain of oxygen or the loss of hydrogen that will have the most impact.  So it can be read both on pH and EH axis.  So when you have low EH and low pH, you will have the main form would be ammonium.<br />

There's a growing interest in developing microbial populations that can really suppress different<br />

What is the impact of redox and pH on the soil microbial community?  So this is probably the most interesting thing.<br />

And in the other way, the microbial activity will have a huge impact on EH and pH.  This control or alter the EH, pH of the environment to make it more profitable, more favorable<br />

So each species of microorganism will have a specific EH and pH zone where it will thrive.  So some of them are very rather bequeathed.<br />

But many, many microorganisms have a very narrow EH, pH of functioning.  It's very much related to the energetic functioning and to the function they will fill in, especially<br />

Nitrification will be at high pH, high EH, and the other way around nitrogen fixation  can be done only at very low EH.<br />

So if nitrogen fixation can only happen at very low EH, I think the experiences that  I've had and what I've observed generally soils tend to have commercially farm soils<br />

They tend to be fairly oxidized.  Why is that and how can we reverse it?<br />

The microbes, they breathe and through respiration, they consume oxygen source.<br />

So in order to have balanced redox potential in your soil, you need good soil aeration  and very active microbial activity.<br />

So you should not get too low redox potential in your soil.<br />

But you should not have too high redox potential.<br />

That's the basis for forming a soil where plants will be able to develop without losing  too much energy to adjust this in the rhizosphere.<br />

So in fact, all the energy in the soil is coming from the plants.  So everything starts with the plants, with the photosynthesis, everything that lowers<br />

And when the soil has not enough energy, that means as a too high redox potential, that  means lack electron and a too high pH lacking proton, the plant will need to adjust, especially<br />

It's a matter of sustaining proper EH, pH at the cell level.  It's a requirement for the functioning of the plants, sustaining homeostasis for EH<br />

And the plant has several mechanisms to do this, some chemical buffers, some activation  of genes to make proteins to adjust in the medium term.<br />

And for this, it will pump product from the photosynthesis to the roots, all this root<br />

It depends on what the plant is missing, is lacking.  And this microorganism will adjust EH, pH level, the favorable level for the plant.<br />

So if you make a diagram with pH on the X axis and EH on the Y axis, you will be able  to assess the different zones according to pH and EH.<br />

High pH is a low availability of proton and it's alkaline or basic conditions.  For redox, low EH means high electron availability because the electron is negatively charged.<br />

And that's finally what will really make the difference to assess soil health and plant  health would be to look at the parameter.<br />

We can adjust EH to pH 7.  We can also calculate the PE plus pH, which is an equivalent, PE is the electronic potential.<br />

So in fact, it's difficult to explain this without a graphic, but in fact, PE plus pH,  if you look at it on this pH EH diagram, PE plus pH would be what drives you towards the<br />

So high PE plus pH would correspond to low proton availability and low electron availability.  On the other side, low PE plus pH would be high proton availability, high electron availability.<br />

The 50% is for water use efficiency, it's related to rice, which is a plant really with  high demand on water.<br />

It's some work that has been done in the grey literature for more than 70 years for other  aspects than plants, but I'm just taking back on this kind of work.<br />

It's everywhere, there's thousands of papers.<br />

This started less than 20 years ago.  20 years ago, pH was the key factor for plant physiology, plant pathology, for all these<br />

In less than 20 years, the redox potential has been identified or redox signal have been  identified as a key element that they regulate everything in the plant.<br />

So we still need to understand the interaction between pH and pH in this regulation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:40:47">0:40:47-0:41:06</a>:</strong>  That's probably a point we really need to work at and we cannot find really in the literature.  But globally, what's within and also in plant pathology, the physiological processes are  getting better and better understood.<br />

Plant fungi, pathogenic fungi will develop in oxidized plant and on a rather acidic pH.<br />

The viruses, they will develop more in oxidized conditions, but at higher pH.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:41:45">0:41:45-0:42:05</a>:</strong>  They need high pH to be mobile in the plant.  They need higher pH to swollen and then be able to replicate the RNA.  But they also need high redox potential to block the signal of defense from the plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:42:05">0:42:05-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  by polymerization of the molecule that will be the signal for the plant to try to resist  to the attack of the fungi, of the virus in that case.  So viruses, it's really rather high pH and high EH.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:41</a>:</strong>  On the other side, pathogenic bacteria will develop at low redox potential.  They have a metabolism based on a lot on sulfur and iron, so they need lower redox potential  and rather alkaline conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:42:41">0:42:41-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  Homicets that were previously identified as fungi are now recognized as different category.  They don't have ketones and they are very close from the brown algae and this are also  very quite rather close from the bacteria.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:19</a>:</strong>  So they will be at rather low redox potential and let's say neutral pH.  So with this kind of thing, we can better understand why the different disease develop  in one part of the plant or another part, why they are entered in the plant at the moment<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:43:19">0:43:19-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  or through certain leaves.  All this fits very well with all what we know.  And for insects, it will be rather also it's rather related to this.<br />

It's a war for redox.  They will, the plant when it's attacked by a pathogen will try to kill it through over-oxidation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:43:48">0:43:48-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  It has not enough energy to control the pathogen by reduction.  So it will try to over-oxidize through hydrogen peroxide mainly.  And at the same time, so this is localized where the pathogen is attacking.<br />

So getting a lower redox potential and lower pH because globally it's at low EH and low<br />

And then for the insect, we can also have mechanism of resistance related to low redox  potential.<br />

But of course it depends if the insects are feeding on the phloem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:44:53">0:44:53-0:45:22</a>:</strong>  Usually the phloem is more reduced and more alkaline than the xylem or the leaf tissues.  A feed for instance, that are vectors of different viruses will eat in the phloem.  They are sucking insects eating in the phloem, so it's rather alkaline conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:36</a>:</strong>  And they will prefer this kind of plants.  So especially when the phloem is not as reduced as it's supposed to be, especially when the  photosynthesis is not working well.<br />

But first of all, it will be the accumulation of secondary metabolites that are very reduced<br />

And when the insect is biting this and chewing this, it will get unpalatable food for this  insect.<br />

So this insect will not be attracted by such plants that have a high secondary metabolite  content.<br />

And all the interactions between the insects and the different disease are also a fascinating  research area at the moment.<br />

And all this in interactions with the pests and the diseases.  So it's really a powerful tool to analyze all these interactions and to better understand<br />

I believe that is the piece that I particularly am so excited about is we could have a very  long conversation unwrapping and unraveling all the different interactions and the zones<br />

But the bottom line is that measuring and understanding the interactions between Ruedox  and pH gives us a tool to understand where we are.<br />

That's the piece that I'm really excited about.  Yeah, surely.<br />

It's the classical electrochemical methods for measurement.  The measurements are false by the electromagnetic field.<br />

That's probably the major reason why this has not been studied before.<br />

The other difficulty is that, especially in the soil, EH and pH are extremely valuable  in space and in time.<br />

Once we understood what are the different processes are doing in our soil and in our  plants, we can adjust the direction where we want to go.<br />

In France, we have a very nice book called the Encyclopedia of the Bioindicators of Weeds.  If you read this encyclopedia, all the parameters that describe they can be interpreted into<br />

That's something we started to work on also is how we can use the different weeds as indicator  of our conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:56:28">0:56:28-0:56:51</a>:</strong>  For instance, when you have in the same places some weeds that reflect a very low redox potential,  hydromorphine and things like that, and plants that reflect oxidized environments, that means  you probably on very compacted soil, you will have high electrical conductivity, but it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:56:51">0:56:51-0:57:03</a>:</strong>  compacted soil.  And if you are both at this on the same locations, because the soil is shifting from one to one  situation to the other one, so it could be really an indicator of poor soil conditions.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:57:21">0:57:21-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  Sounds to me like I need to get the encyclopedia translated into English.  You described how when measuring redox values, they can really fluctuate based on the electromagnetic  environment.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:57:51">0:57:51-0:58:04</a>:</strong>  systems from a biophysics rather than a biochemistry perspective.  What have you been observing with those parameters?  So the first for electrical conductivity, it's obviously a very important parameter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:58:04">0:58:04-0:58:20</a>:</strong>  We try to make it simple through pH and EH, but probably the most optimal EH pH zone also  depends on the electrical conductivity.  So this is something we need to adjust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:58:20">0:58:20-0:58:39</a>:</strong>  We need balanced EH, balanced pH, but also balanced electrical conductivity.  And globally we can analyze our soil, plants, microorganism system as an electrical circuit.  Redox potential will indicate it's a voltage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:58:39">0:58:39-0:58:54</a>:</strong>  We measure difference of potential, so it's a voltage.  And to understand an electrical system, the voltage is not enough.  You need to have the resistance of your system or the inverse resistance is the electrical<br />

So, sorry, the inverse of resistivity is an electrical conductivity.  So the electrical conductivity gives you an idea of the resistance of your system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:59:12">0:59:12-0:59:28</a>:</strong>  And the electrical conductivity, it's a key parameter for precision agriculture.  They can use it to assess many parameters in the soil, including compaction, salinity,  different nutrient levels, CEC.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:59:28">0:59:28-0:59:48</a>:</strong>  So they measure it and they adjust the fertilization application most of the time to this key parameter.  And if we analyze this system as an electrical system, in fact, the leads would be the solar  panel that are charging the battery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=0:59:48">0:59:48-1:00:01</a>:</strong>  The battery would be the soil and the stable carbon will be the compartment of the battery  and the carbon accessible to microbes and the microbial activity will be the charge  of the battery.<br />

So it would be the square voltage time the electrical conductivity gives you an idea  of your production.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:35</a>:</strong>  So if you have very high electrical conductivity, you can produce a lot.  The power of your system is very high, but you unload your battery very fast.  So if you don't have the solar panel to reload the battery, you unload your battery and you<br />

It's what we get on soil that have lost their organic matter, their biological activity.  It's an empty battery.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:01:03">1:01:03-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  This could sustain or even increase the production, but unload the battery, we've been losing  organic matter.  On the opposite, if your electric conductivity is very low, then you will not be able to<br />

So you need a balanced electrical conductivity that can produce as much as possible without  unloading the battery.<br />

That's why it's so important to have cover crops, living crops all the time to maximize  the photosynthesis.<br />

We get free energy from the sun, but we get it only if we can catch it.  And for this, we need efficient photosynthesis.<br />

First, we are not catching the energy from the sun, but we also have a process of oxidation<br />

This creates very oxidizing product that will attack the organic matter.  As soon as we have a plant, some leaves that catch the energy from the sun, we increase<br />

When we think about electrical conductivity, I've wondered whether or observed, I believe  that electrical conductivity is not all quite the same.<br />

The one you described, what we could call ionic electrical conductivity, which is very  much related to the ions in the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:03:46">1:03:46-1:04:01</a>:</strong>  The other one is the bulk electrical conductivity.  It's more related to the soil structure, to the humidity of the soil.  It's again why the soil structure is so important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/redox-the-driver-of-soil-microbial-interactions-and-nutrient-availability-with-olivier-husson/#t=1:04:01">1:04:01-1:04:12</a>:</strong>  It's probably this second one that is the most important electrical conductivity in  the soil.  It's the bulk electrical conductivity.<br />

Regarding paramagnetism, because I did not answer your question on this, this is a parameter  that is very poorly known in scientific papers.<br />

There are ways to increase this paramagnetism through application of very paramagnetic basals,<br />

We know how to do this.  Usually we can treat with iron sulfate before pyrolysis.<br />

Also, when we read the literature in sedimentology, especially, we learn that at the interface  between water and air, you can develop some magnetotactic bacteria that produce magnetite<br />

It's probably a research track we need to work on.  I believe that we can have an impact on soil paramagnetism through our coping practices<br />

The better the soil structure, the more water-air interface we will get.  So the highest probability we will get to develop this paramagnetic bacteria.<br />

Another hypothesis I made regarding paramagnetism is that one of the cause of pests, attacks,  and things like this is probably also related to high electrical conductivity.<br />

We probably need to keep a balance between the two.  I make the hypothesis that increasing soil paramagnetism will help us to keep our plants<br />

All these are hypotheses, but I suspect that this paramagnetism aspect to be a very powerful<br />

All what you proposed with the seaweeds, with all this nutrition, all these cover crops,<br />

So I also believe that it is a very important parameter.  Olivier and I could continue this conversation for hours because the scope of his work and<br />

And so we've actually, earlier this week, we hosted a very long webinar with a group<br />
