Today I'm delighted and  honored to have Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms in Virginia here with us. Joel Salatin is a voice  and a name that scarcely needs an introduction. He has been a voice of inspiration to very many.<br />

One of the questions that I was asked to ask you is one of your strengths is  that you're very articulate and able to describe your ideas and positions well to other people.<br />

Generally if a farmer is filling out a job description,  nowhere on that job description will it say storytelling ability or communication skills.  You know it'll be things like managing animals or keeping good records,<br />

Seldom do you see communication on there and so I've been blessed when I was through school,  competing in forensics and debate, theater, drama. I was always in the school plays and<br />

I mean clearly  I have a gift for that but it's a gift that's been honed and I think this is what's important  that you may not become the most gifted orator but you can develop at least some rudimentary skills<br />

There's the  international speakers, non-profit called Toastmasters and their whole deal is their local  chapters all over the country, Toastmasters and what they do is they teach communication and<br />

People critique  you and you know you work at it. The truth is that people who are not familiar with the  world, who learn to communicate in any field become the pace setters, kind of the leaders<br />

You don't have to be the best but if you can tell the story the best,  you'll be considered an expert, you'll have an audience. People don't know I practice speeches  in front of a mirror, you know I give them to myself in the mirror and you you know you're<br />

Farmers tend to not be readers and  I would encourage just immersing yourself in a broad range of things. You know keep up on<br />

Yes I've said that  more times than once. Unfortunately government organic certification at least has become a bit<br />

You know we understand that it's more  than just a list of do's and don'ts, it's an embrace of a of a worldview of a way we view  life and the way the world works.
