I think that I have a natural tendency to say,  are we doing things the best that we can<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:06:08">0:06:08-0:06:16</a>:</strong>  by a chemistry professor of mine in college  and she said, question everything.  And so that's what I do.<br />

All those things are wrapped into somebody  that is trying to figure out how to do things differently<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:26">0:07:26-0:07:38</a>:</strong>  of capital, of labor in our financial returns.  And what I mean by that is it was getting harder and harder  for us to eke out that premium return<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:38">0:07:38-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  that we wanted for our fruit.  We were just having a harder time generating  that difference between, I guess you might say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:08:00</a>:</strong>  wholesale cherries and what we consider  as a premium market cherry.  And so I looked at our production system and said,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:00">0:08:00-0:08:13</a>:</strong>  my gosh, we are just focusing on the top of the tree.  The parts of the cherry tree that you could see  with the naked eye, boy, we've gotten really good<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:13">0:08:13-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  at growing that part of the tree.  Of course, nothing was ever perfect  as I mentioned previously, but I was,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:30</a>:</strong>  for lack of a better term, running out of good ideas.  The creative tank was running low on things  that we could do better with the management of the tree<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:30">0:08:30-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  as you can see it.  And so I thought, what about the parts of the tree  you can't see?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:55</a>:</strong>  And that led me to a really great exploration  of the soils and roots and that often forgotten part  of orchards and conventional farming logic,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:08:55">0:08:55-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  which is the ground.  Everyone knows as farmers that the soil is important.  When we buy a new piece of land or we look at planting<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:16</a>:</strong>  a new orchard, the first thing that we look at  is the quality of the soil.  But after that, the way that I was farming<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:16">0:09:16-0:09:26</a>:</strong>  in a conventional matter, we quit paying attention  to the quality of our soil and just started focusing  on those things I mentioned with just the top of the tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:26">0:09:26-0:09:33</a>:</strong>  How can we prune it?  How can we plant varieties?  How can we do training systems, irrigation system design<br />

And I think that was probably one of the most exciting<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:09:46">0:09:46-0:09:58</a>:</strong>  things for me personally and professionally  is when I opened up a whole new set of challenges  with how we could improve our soils and improve<br />

And it really got me charged up about farming again.  Not to say that I wasn't already excited about farming,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:22</a>:</strong>  but it really was one of those things  that was exciting and new.  And brought me a lot of great satisfaction.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:34">0:10:34-0:10:40</a>:</strong>  in terms of practical management?  Did you end up making any management changes?  How did that change your farming operation?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:40">0:10:40-0:10:58</a>:</strong>  Over time, we made a lot of changes to how we farm.  It's not to say that we did a lot of corrective actions  because we were farming conventionally,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:10</a>:</strong>  but orchards are fortunate in that we don't do  a lot of tillage, we don't do a lot of the mechanical things  that and other crops are harmful to the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:12">0:11:12-0:11:24</a>:</strong>  And we also had a permanent crop in place  where our renewal cycle on an orchard  is typically between 25 and 35 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:24">0:11:24-0:11:33</a>:</strong>  So we'll plant an orchard and leave it in place  for 25 or 35 years.  And so that gave us opportunities to do things<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:33">0:11:33-0:11:45</a>:</strong>  that other crops may not have the luxury  of being able to do.  But we did add a lot of layers to our management<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:45">0:11:45-0:11:55</a>:</strong>  of the orchard, where we did additional activities  that were focused upon that invisible part of the tree,  focused upon the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:12:04</a>:</strong>  And I can talk about those.  There was a lot of different things that we tried.  Some of them were successful and some of them were not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:04">0:12:04-0:12:16</a>:</strong>  But over a period of years where we were exploring  new management techniques, we did settle up on some  that we thought worked quite nicely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:17">0:12:17-0:12:23</a>:</strong>  I would love to expand on those a bit more, Mike.  Can you tell us about some of the things that you tried  that perhaps didn't work so well<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:23">0:12:23-0:12:28</a>:</strong>  and then what you eventually ended up doing?  Well, there's lots of things I tried  that didn't work out well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:28">0:12:28-0:12:39</a>:</strong>  And I think that we all like to talk about the successes,  but oftentimes can learn a great deal from failures  or things that didn't turn out so well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:40">0:12:40-0:12:54</a>:</strong>  I'll start with perhaps one of them that's a mixed bag  because like anything that is worthwhile,  this was a complex project ahead of us that we had.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:12:54">0:12:54-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  And we started out learning about how we could enhance  our soils and things we could do to boost our plants.  And one of the challenges that we had was how to scale<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:28</a>:</strong>  that up, how to go from techniques that worked, say,  in a small market garden where the grower is selling  directly to consumer, maybe only working part-time,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:28">0:13:28-0:13:41</a>:</strong>  and how do we scale that up to the size of operation  that we had, which is 350 acres of fruit  and 1,800 tons of fruit produced every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:42">0:13:42-0:13:53</a>:</strong>  And we started out with things that we thought  would be simple and easy.  And one of those was, well, let's put out compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:13:53">0:13:53-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  We'll put out compost on all acres that we have  under management, and that'll be of a benefit for us.  So we set a timeframe because you can't do,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  when you're talking that amount of compost,  we couldn't apply compost on all acres.  But what we found was that the logistical expense<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:27</a>:</strong>  of moving thousands and thousands of yards of compost  from where it's manufactured, which is,  it wasn't anywhere local for us, so we had to go<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:27">0:14:27-0:14:39</a>:</strong>  to the Portland metropolitan area, which is about  80 miles away to get that volume of compost we needed.  So getting that compost here, paying for the trucking,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:39">0:14:39-0:14:51</a>:</strong>  paying for an area where you can land that much material,  buying or renting equipment that was out of our norm,  a bucket loaders and that sort of thing,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:14:52">0:14:52-0:15:04</a>:</strong>  became a real challenge for us.  Just the cost of that material to move it around  and then to get it applied, we had a return<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:04">0:15:04-0:15:18</a>:</strong>  on our investment, but it was a really massive operation.  It was, if you will, sucking a lot of diesel,  a lot of steel, and that is not where I wanted to go<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:19">0:15:19-0:15:31</a>:</strong>  with biointensive management of my farm.  And I think that the compost did work for us,  but if I were to do it again, I would have taken<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:15:54">0:15:54-0:16:02</a>:</strong>  and down the roads, giant equipment rolling  at our landings, and then a lot of equipment  to move that material out onto the orchard rows.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:02">0:16:02-0:16:13</a>:</strong>  Mike, obviously you're making these comments  about the possibilities of getting even better ROI  with other techniques based on experience.<br />

I think that if I were to start at day zero again<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:16:29">0:16:29-0:16:43</a>:</strong>  in this process where I would focus a majority  of my energy to would be mulches.  What we learned over time is that the primary benefit<br />

What I learned was that it didn't matter as much<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:00">0:17:00-0:17:13</a>:</strong>  what material was on top of the soil.  We put pine chips on top of our soils.  We put straw on top of our soils, different types of straw,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:13">0:17:13-0:17:24</a>:</strong>  wheat straw, grass seed straw.  What I found was that we were able to get  the soil underneath the tree covered.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:24">0:17:24-0:17:37</a>:</strong>  What I found over time was that the compost was,  of course, contributing nutrients and all those things  that we all love compost for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:37">0:17:37-0:17:47</a>:</strong>  I love compost, of course, but in my flower pots,  not on my orchard scale.  But what I found was that the material that we were applying<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:47">0:17:47-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  wasn't super great compost.  It wasn't super powerful compost  with those humic components that we needed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:08</a>:</strong>  It was really serving as a mulch where it protected  the soil from sun, from irrigation,  the physical damage that irrigation causes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:08">0:18:08-0:18:20</a>:</strong>  So the thing that I found was that in our orchard systems  where we maintain a permanent side alleyway  in between the tree rows, for generations,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:20">0:18:20-0:18:31</a>:</strong>  our family has just been mowing that alleyway  like many other growers and leaving the clippings  sitting in the alleyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:31">0:18:31-0:18:43</a>:</strong>  What I found and arrived at was if we could move that grass  that we cut and windrow it right in the tree row  and cover the soil in the tree row,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:43">0:18:43-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  we could accomplish similar results to the compost  with a fraction of that land laborer and capital investment  that we were making with the compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  and accomplish it with a practice that we already do,  which is mow our alleyway rows.  And so if I was to pick one thing that we landed on<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:22</a>:</strong>  that improved upon the compost, it would be mow and blow  because we could then go right over the top of that  during the growing season,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:22">0:19:22-0:19:34</a>:</strong>  we would throw our grass clippings onto the tree row  and then in cherries and other tree fruits,  pruning is a very important process that we do<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:34">0:19:34-0:19:46</a>:</strong>  during the winter, during a dormant period of the orchard.  And we generate a huge amount of carbon  in the form of cut branches that we stack in the alleyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:46">0:19:46-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  And just like the grass,  we would mow that down and leave it there.  But with mow and blow, we're able to shred those prunings<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  and move them over into the alleyway  with the mow and blow mowers and windrow those,  that carbon source right there in the tree row as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:17</a>:</strong>  And boy, that technique really pushed us forward,  getting the soil covered,  because I think that it allowed us to then put on<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:17">0:20:17-0:20:31</a>:</strong>  some very focused and very fine tuned applications  of nutrients, biological stimulants,  a wide variety of things onto the soil, onto that mulch<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:31">0:20:31-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  and get a very rapid response  without the big earth moving equipment process  that the compost required us to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:57</a>:</strong>  I think that the value of compost in our systems  is to apply a very purposely made refined compost  that can go on at a fraction of the amount that we applied<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:20:57">0:20:57-0:21:06</a>:</strong>  when we just bought our compost.  We bought our thousands and thousands of yard orders  of municipal compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:06">0:21:06-0:21:14</a>:</strong>  Instead, what we started doing was making  a very small amount in comparison  to the thousands of yards amounts we were putting on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:14">0:21:14-0:21:24</a>:</strong>  We started making here on our farm,  very small amounts of purposely made  nutrient focused compost,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:24">0:21:24-0:21:36</a>:</strong>  where we incorporated nutrients that we knew we needed  in our orchards, but put that material on  in the form of a compost where we put on a fraction of it<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:36">0:21:36-0:21:44</a>:</strong>  and got a lot more bang for our buck  because that compost was really a nutrient input  instead of a mulch input that we had been doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:44">0:21:44-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  with the previous compost.  Mike, you've mentioned a couple of pieces  I'd like to follow up on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:54</a>:</strong>  I want to come back at some point  and elaborate a bit more on the nutrient applications  that you were describing,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:21:54">0:21:54-0:22:04</a>:</strong>  but also you've identified the Moam Blow  as being foundational to building a soil cover  and covering the soil within the tree row.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:04">0:22:04-0:22:11</a>:</strong>  What are the possibilities of using cover crops  and producing even more biomass  for that Moam Blow operation<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:11">0:22:11-0:22:21</a>:</strong>  in addition to the grass that you're growing?  That's a great question, John.  We began to utilize cover crops in our alleyways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:22">0:22:22-0:22:33</a>:</strong>  Since some of your listeners may not understand  everything about orchards here in Oregon,  we maintain an alleyway between the trees<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:40</a>:</strong>  that we can drive up and down.  And you need to have some kind of crop  that's growing there to hold the soil in place<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:40">0:22:40-0:22:48</a>:</strong>  so that it doesn't erode  and to keep your orchard from turning into,  I'll just say a dust bowl.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:48">0:22:48-0:22:56</a>:</strong>  We don't want to have thousands of small,  just dirt roads going up and down our alleyways  through our orchards because that creates<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:22:56">0:22:56-0:23:05</a>:</strong>  a giant dust plume, which is bad for everybody,  especially the soil in our trees.  And so we have maintained sod,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:05">0:23:05-0:23:14</a>:</strong>  just perennial ryegrass, creeping red fescue.  There's orchard grass, sods.  Many growers have their own favorite.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:22</a>:</strong>  And that sod does its job.  It holds the soil in place.  It keeps the dust down,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:22">0:23:22-0:23:34</a>:</strong>  but it does not contribute a whole lot to the trees.  After we landed on the mow and blow technique,  we started with just blowing what we already had<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:34">0:23:34-0:23:42</a>:</strong>  in the alleyways over.  So blowing our perennial rye, in our case,  over into the alleyway is where we started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:43">0:23:43-0:23:50</a>:</strong>  But I began to say, all right,  is this the best way to do it?  Is there something else that we can plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:23:50">0:23:50-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  in the alleyways and blow to the side?  And so cover crops are where we went with our efforts  to generate more biomass in the alleyway<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:15</a>:</strong>  and then transfer that biomass using our mowers  over into the tree row and have it act as a mulch.  And we started here with cover cropping<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:15">0:24:15-0:24:23</a>:</strong>  on fallow fields that were waiting to be planted.  We would maintain cover crops there.  And we had various mixes of plant species<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:23">0:24:23-0:24:30</a>:</strong>  that we utilized in those areas.  And we just took those plants  that worked in our fallow fields,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:30">0:24:30-0:24:36</a>:</strong>  big open fields waiting to have orchard trees  replanted into them.  And we started putting them in the alleyways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:36">0:24:36-0:24:45</a>:</strong>  And we had some success and some failure there  because a big open field that has no trees growing above it  is a very different environment<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:45">0:24:45-0:24:56</a>:</strong>  for sun loving cover crop plants  than the shade of an orchard canopy in an alleyway.  We have found a series of plants that we really like<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:24:56">0:24:56-0:25:06</a>:</strong>  to put into our alleyways and grow  that generate a lot of biomass during the dormant season  from basically fall until spring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:06">0:25:06-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  We don't have a lot of equipment passing over our alleyways  and the cover crop has an opportunity  to grow during that time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:23</a>:</strong>  And then in the spring, before we start doing  our orchard management activities  where the alleyways are quite busy with equipment,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:23">0:25:23-0:25:31</a>:</strong>  we take that cover crop that's grown over the winter  and generated a lot of biomass  and we blow that over into the tree row.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:31">0:25:31-0:25:42</a>:</strong>  And it generates a good start to our growing season  for the cherries when the soil is starting to warm up.  In the tree row, it gets this very nice coating<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:42">0:25:42-0:25:52</a>:</strong>  of adverse species mix of mulch on top of it.  Mike, when you have these cover crops  during the winter months,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:52">0:25:52-0:25:58</a>:</strong>  doesn't that have the effect of then choking out the sod?  How do you manage?  Do you still have a sod for the following year?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:25:58">0:25:58-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  That's a great question.  We maintain two crops in our alleyways each year.  We have an overwintering cover crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:19</a>:</strong>  and then we plant a fast growing,  you might call it a temporary sod.  I don't know if it would be proper to call the cover crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:19">0:26:19-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  that grows during the warm season in our rows a true sod,  but we maintain a green crop there,  but it's not grown as cover crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:39</a>:</strong>  because it's very difficult to generate  a whole lot of biomass when you have  as many equipment passes going up and down the rows<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:39">0:26:39-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  from essentially May through August is what we do in cherries.  We were never able to find a warm season crop  that we could plant and grow as a cover crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:27:00</a>:</strong>  where we generate a lot of biomass  because we just have too many different sized  pieces of equipment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:00">0:27:00-0:27:09</a>:</strong>  We have ATVs, we have RTVs,  we have various sizes of tractors.  And so by the time you take all those tire tracks<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:17">0:27:17-0:27:25</a>:</strong>  where anything has an opportunity to grow.  And keep in mind, it can't grow that tall  because the plants getting constantly batted down<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:25">0:27:25-0:27:34</a>:</strong>  by equipment passing over the top of it.  So in essence, what you're describing,  if I'm understanding it correctly,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:34">0:27:34-0:27:43</a>:</strong>  is you actually plant two crops.  You plant what you're considering a cover crop in the fall  to produce biomass during the winter months<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:43">0:27:43-0:27:49</a>:</strong>  and then you're planting a soil cover  or a ground cover in the spring, is that right?  Yes, that's exactly what we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:50">0:27:50-0:27:55</a>:</strong>  Mike, I think this is something  that a lot of people are interested in.  It's something that I personally get a lot of questions<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:27:55">0:27:55-0:28:01</a>:</strong>  about, can you tell us a little bit about the cover crops  that you ended up selecting,  particularly for your winter cover,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:01">0:28:01-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  what the rationale was for those?  So when we started looking at cover crops,  it was really difficult because when I began my research,<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:27">0:28:27-0:28:44</a>:</strong>  And keep in mind that our focus has been on what works  and not necessarily if it will sprout and grow,  but will it sprout, grow and accomplish our goals?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:44">0:28:44-0:28:55</a>:</strong>  And so what I found in those lists were,  it was very difficult for me to find anybody in orchards  that was doing what we were doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:28:55">0:28:55-0:29:02</a>:</strong>  There was few, if any, there was nobody I knew of  that I could call and talk to  and have an in-depth conversation<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:02">0:29:02-0:29:10</a>:</strong>  about what species are you planting,  because I didn't know of anybody that was doing this.  There were people that were just like me,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:10">0:29:10-0:29:21</a>:</strong>  would plant a cover crop in a fallow field,  but there was nobody that was planting it in the alleyway.  So what I did, John, was I took the species that grew<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  the best in the fallow fields  and tried them in the alleyways.  And what I found was that not every species did well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:34">0:29:34-0:29:41</a>:</strong>  In fact, most species didn't do well,  but the species that we landed on  that did do a good job in the alleyways<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:41">0:29:41-0:29:52</a>:</strong>  really do do a good job.  I can talk about those specifically if you'd like.  Yeah, what did you find to have that level of success?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:29:52">0:29:52-0:30:07</a>:</strong>  So for us, the mix that we really like in our alleyways  is a mix of annual rye,  which all the row crop growers are maybe cringing<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:07">0:30:07-0:30:21</a>:</strong>  when I say that, but it's not a problem for us.  And our perennial system, we put in a mix of annual rye,  triticale, and then a mustard species,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:22">0:30:22-0:30:38</a>:</strong>  a forage kale, a hybrid forage kale, and tillage radish.  Those species work really, really well for us.  And you might notice that I didn't name a legume<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:38">0:30:38-0:30:51</a>:</strong>  in that mix, and that is because we had difficulty  finding a legume that would work in this application.  And we tried lots and lots of different legumes,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:30:51">0:30:51-0:31:02</a>:</strong>  and we never were able to find one that worked for us.  But the other thing was that we found  is when we were evaluating legumes in our fallow fields<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:02">0:31:02-0:31:12</a>:</strong>  and in our alleyways, voles and gophers  would become a real issue for us.  They were very attracted to the legumes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:12">0:31:12-0:31:21</a>:</strong>  And so I avoided those because we didn't find one  that worked well, and the vole and gopher problem  they generated was a big deal to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I understand that that is a major deal  for a lot of tree fruit production.  But then also when you say that you didn't find a legume<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:38</a>:</strong>  that worked well for you, what were the other things  that worked well for you? What were the parameters  and the characteristics that you were looking for?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:38">0:31:38-0:31:46</a>:</strong>  Was it just because of slippery slopes,  or what were the constraints on legumes  other than the gophers and the voles?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:32:04</a>:</strong>  Okay, so we evaluated a lot of different clover species,  and what we found was that we just didn't get them  to establish well and grow for us consistently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:04">0:32:04-0:32:16</a>:</strong>  When we talk about having a return on our investment,  we need to have every seed that goes into that mix  be there because we know it's gonna earn us a return,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:16">0:32:16-0:32:22</a>:</strong>  not because we want to feel good,  feel that we're maybe doing something  that we read in a book was important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:22">0:32:22-0:32:37</a>:</strong>  And so we just did not have consistent stands  of clovers established for us.  We found that vetch could work for us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:44</a>:</strong>  It would establish and it would grow  and it would be of benefit,  but here's where the catch comes in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:44">0:32:44-0:32:56</a>:</strong>  Vetch is not very well behaved at staying in the alleyway.  It would take advantage of that nice open space  underneath the tree where it didn't have competition<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:32:56">0:32:56-0:33:07</a>:</strong>  from its companions in the alleyway,  and it would grow into the tree row,  which would be fine until it would encounter<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:07">0:33:07-0:33:14</a>:</strong>  a micro sprinkler.  We irrigate almost all of our acres.  Well, we irrigate all of our acres by drip<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:14">0:33:14-0:33:22</a>:</strong>  or micro sprinkler irrigation.  And so when that vetch vine would encounter  the micro sprinkler, it would whip up around it<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:22">0:33:22-0:33:33</a>:</strong>  and it would make the micro sprinkler be ineffective  because the sprinkler would be covered in vetch.  And so because I couldn't make vetch pave,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:33">0:33:33-0:33:43</a>:</strong>  I was forced to eliminate it from our mix.  Got it.  Which actually leads me to another question<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:43">0:33:43-0:33:50</a>:</strong>  that I had wanted to ask is,  have you considered growing any cover crops in the tree row?  Is that a possibility?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:34:05</a>:</strong>  Boy, that is,  that's something that I would love to have happen for us.  And it seems so incredibly simple to say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:19</a>:</strong>  why can't we just grow something in the tree row?  But yet it is incredibly, incredibly complicated  to find something that works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:20">0:34:20-0:34:35</a>:</strong>  I have tried countless species and countless mixes  to grow underneath our trees in the tree row  and have yet to find one that works really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:35">0:34:35-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  And I'm sure that people are sitting listening right now  thinking, oh my gosh, what do you mean?  Just look at all those things that you could plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  But it is very difficult to find a plant  that stays low enough, it does not interfere  with our micro sprinkler irrigation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:35:11</a>:</strong>  And that can grow well in areas of the tree row  that are in full sun, full blazing sun  for the entire duration of the day,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:11">0:35:11-0:35:19</a>:</strong>  and yet can grow right up to the trunk of the tree,  which may be full shade  for almost the entire duration of the day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:19">0:35:19-0:35:30</a>:</strong>  And then probably most importantly,  compete with weeds that grow in a tree row  that we unfortunately can't allow to be there<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:30">0:35:30-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  because of the micro sprinkler irrigation.  I have just not come up with that species yet.  And also a species that can survive being buried<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:51</a>:</strong>  in underneath the mow and blow mulch and still emerge  and remain short while doing all those things.  Yes, and have a foot traffic of,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:36:02</a>:</strong>  there's not a lot of foot traffic in the tree row,  except during harvest, we have hundreds,  we have several hundred people that enter a small block.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:02">0:36:02-0:36:14</a>:</strong>  Those people have to, I'm gonna use a technical term,  trump around the tree to get the fruit picked.  And that tramples a lot of cover crops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:14">0:36:14-0:36:28</a>:</strong>  And so the list of requirements that we have for a plant,  I have not found yet that accomplishes everything.  We can get things that grow beautiful<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:28">0:36:28-0:36:38</a>:</strong>  underneath young trees, baby trees  that don't have a big canopy and that aren't in production.  But as soon as those trees get up and start to shade,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:38">0:36:38-0:36:47</a>:</strong>  as soon as we start having pruning activity going on,  we would tramp those cover crops down.  Then the mow and blow brings a whole new dynamic<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:47">0:36:47-0:36:58</a>:</strong>  because there's nothing that I have found  that will not interfere with the micro sprinklers  that can take that mulch getting put on top.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:36:59">0:36:59-0:37:09</a>:</strong>  Challenging set of conditions for certain.  So I'm open to any ideas to the listener community  out there for your podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:09">0:37:09-0:37:21</a>:</strong>  But if there's something that you've tried  and it works for you, please let me know about it.  There are a couple of species that do, I'm gonna say, okay,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:21">0:37:21-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  but to plant hundreds of acres of them is impossible  because of the nature of, you know,  they may be a tuber or they may be a bulb,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:43</a>:</strong>  or we may need to start them as a small potted plant.  Well, that's practical under a few trees  and in a backyard scenario, or maybe a very small orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:43">0:37:43-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  But when you talk about hundreds or thousands of acres,  you could be talking about millions of plants  that you can't find a horticultural nursery<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:37:51">0:37:51-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  that could produce them economically for you.  And it's a real challenge.  Another thing is I found some species<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:11</a>:</strong>  that I thought were great,  but after we got a foot of snow on the ground,  the gophers and voles also thought that they were great<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:11">0:38:11-0:38:17</a>:</strong>  and they were gone come spring.  An interesting set of challenging conditions.  Mike, can you tell us a little bit about<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:17">0:38:17-0:38:25</a>:</strong>  some of the species that you experimented with  that were tubers or potted plants that worked okay?  Yes, I can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:27">0:38:27-0:38:38</a>:</strong>  There are three of them that did a good job  that we just aren't able to scale effectively.  One of them is a Juga.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  The Latin name escapes me,  or your listeners, excuse me, will have to Google it.  I didn't come prepared with the Latin name,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  but a Juga is one of the species that worked well.  We planted not the variegated types or anything,  the fancy ones, just the wild type, if you will.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:38:57">0:38:57-0:39:03</a>:</strong>  The second plant is moneywort.  That worked quite well.  Again, it was just something<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:03">0:39:03-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  that was impossible for us to scale.  And then the third species is a non-hybrid comfrey  that we found worked very nicely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:18">0:39:18-0:39:28</a>:</strong>  Again, I don't remember the Latin name of it.  I could maybe send that to you,  and you could include it in the description<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:28">0:39:28-0:39:36</a>:</strong>  for this podcast, John.  But it was sold as the common name European comfrey,  although looking at it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:36">0:39:36-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  it looks different than what I would consider  European comfrey, but that's what it was sold to us as.  Got it.<br />

Thank you for sharing that, Mike.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:39:59</a>:</strong>  A few moments ago, before we began speaking  about your mow and blow and the cover crops  that you're growing, you mentioned that once you<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:39:59">0:39:59-0:40:08</a>:</strong>  had established a mulch,  you then also began putting on more nutrient applications  and biological inoculants and biostimulants<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:08">0:40:08-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  into the tree row.  What, can you tell us a little bit about some of the things  that you've been using, new tools that you've adopted,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:24</a>:</strong>  and the results that you've observed?  I sure can.  So I started the process of focusing on the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:24">0:40:24-0:40:35</a>:</strong>  Maybe many folks have done the same thing,  but this is what I did, is I started to put on  every biological biostimulant and inoculant<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:35">0:40:35-0:40:46</a>:</strong>  that was available and seeing what worked.  And what I found was that there are, of course,  like one would expect products that work better than others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:40:46">0:40:46-0:41:02</a>:</strong>  But what I really learned was that hindsight is indeed 2020.  And I found that by spraying inoculants onto the bare soil  as we were maintaining our alleyways,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:02">0:41:02-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  just didn't make sense to me without having material there  to protect everything that you're putting on,  to feed everything that you're putting on,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:25</a>:</strong>  it didn't make sense.  And so what I began doing is I began, as I mentioned,  to put on material before and after my mulch,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:27">0:41:27-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  because there are some things I wanted to be covered  by the mulch and in contact with the soil.  And there are other things that I wanted to have<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:50</a>:</strong>  go on top of the mulch and add some biological horsepower  to the natural processes and kickstart the natural processes  of breaking down that mulch and having it go to work<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:02">0:42:02-0:42:17</a>:</strong>  that I really liked that's made with salmon  and crab material that's available here on the West Coast.  That product I found really, really pushed forward<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:17">0:42:17-0:42:27</a>:</strong>  our soil efforts, our soil enhancement efforts.  And we saw direct benefit in the crop.  We could go as simple as having an orchard<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:27">0:42:27-0:42:36</a>:</strong>  where it's conventionally managed,  but we applied this fish product onto the soil  and onto the foliage of the trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:36">0:42:36-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  And that would be the only difference.  And we saw a big return on our investment there,  substantial return on our investment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  We tried lots of other fish products.  As you know, there are many of them available in the market  and some of them work better than others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:43:04</a>:</strong>  But the one that we found that was made with salmon  and crab here from the West Coast, boy,  that really pushed us forward a lot in our efforts.<br />

When you refer to that as the base<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:16">0:43:16-0:43:23</a>:</strong>  of your nutrition programs,  what other nutritional applications are you doing today  and how have those shifted over the last decade<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:23">0:43:23-0:43:35</a>:</strong>  or since you've started experimenting?  We use nutrition as it's necessary now.  And we're able to do that because we utilize a technique<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:35">0:43:35-0:43:45</a>:</strong>  to monitor what's going on in our orchard in real time  throughout the entire season.  And that technique is SAP analysis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:57</a>:</strong>  For many years, I did my nutrition program  about January or February.  I would sit down and I would look at all of the returns<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:43:57">0:43:57-0:44:09</a>:</strong>  that we had for our orchard for size and price.  I would then look at maybe a couple of leaf samples  that we'd pulled during the growing season,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:09">0:44:09-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  maybe a soil sample.  And I'd write down on a piece of paper  everything I was going to do for the following season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:24</a>:</strong>  And we would follow that recipe.  And we would make minor tweaks depending upon  what the size of the crop was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:24">0:44:24-0:44:32</a>:</strong>  If we were gonna have a light yield  or an average yield or a heavy yield,  maybe we would have a disease problem<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:32">0:44:32-0:44:41</a>:</strong>  that started developing so we'd boost a nutrient or two.  But we essentially would just follow what was written down  on the back of the envelope this time of year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:41">0:44:41-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  We'd follow that through the entire season.  Eight months from when the time something was written down,  we were doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  Well, orchards or any farm is not a static system.  And there is all kinds of in season changes that occur  that need, that require us to change our approach<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:18</a>:</strong>  in nutrition, what we're doing.  And there was no technology that I had confidence in  available until sap analysis for knowing what was going on<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:19">0:45:19-0:45:29</a>:</strong>  right now in my orchard.  So every two weeks, we take a sample from the time  that the first leaves are expanded until<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:29">0:45:29-0:45:37</a>:</strong>  right before a leaf drop.  So the entire growing season of our orchard,  we are sampling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:37">0:45:37-0:45:44</a>:</strong>  We're sending those samples in,  we're getting the result back,  and we are calibrating every nutrient application<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:45:56</a>:</strong>  that we put on based upon those samples.  Because we have a real time picture of what our trees  have need for or what they have excess of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:45:56">0:45:56-0:46:09</a>:</strong>  So every nutrient in every tank is there  because the sap analysis has indicated it needs to be.  So it's very difficult for me to give you general information<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:09">0:46:09-0:46:18</a>:</strong>  or for me to give you generalities, John.  You know, I would love to do that.  I'd love to say that our nutrient program is based on X,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:18">0:46:18-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  Y, and Z, but I really honestly can only say that fish  is something that is in virtually every application.  What else is gonna be there depends upon what the results<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:39</a>:</strong>  of the sap analysis is.  Obviously, Mike, if you're measuring and using sap analysis  and you're customizing, then there's the possibility<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:39">0:46:39-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  that your nutrient applications are very transient.  They're shifting and changing all the time  and there aren't any constants except as you just indicated,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  the one constant of being a liquid fish application.  One question that I have is how similar  are your current types of nutrient applications<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:04</a>:</strong>  to what they might have been  before you were using sap analysis?  Are there still general similarities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:04">0:47:04-0:47:13</a>:</strong>  Were you applying similar trace minerals there?  Or perhaps a different way of asking the question would be,  what were the changes that sap analysis indicated<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:13">0:47:13-0:47:20</a>:</strong>  that really surprised you or that were unexpected?  That's a great question, John.  I'll give you some examples.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:20">0:47:20-0:47:36</a>:</strong>  I mean, before I started doing sap analysis,  I would put on semi loads of triple 20 foliar fertilizer.  I would put on large amounts of zinc in the spring<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:36">0:47:36-0:47:44</a>:</strong>  thinking that the trees needed zinc  in order to generate bigger leaves  because we all know that bigger leaves on the tree<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:44">0:47:44-0:47:55</a>:</strong>  mean more carbohydrates being generated for the tree  to size those cherries and that's what our goal is.  So I'd put on lots of triple 20 and lots of zinc.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:47:55">0:47:55-0:48:09</a>:</strong>  And what I found was that I was shooting myself in the foot  because my trees did not need zinc.  They did not need triple 20 because the potassium<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:10">0:48:10-0:48:20</a>:</strong>  that I was applying in that triple 20  was pushing calcium out of my trees.  So when we started doing sap analysis,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:20">0:48:20-0:48:29</a>:</strong>  I found myself putting on oodles and oodles of calcium  and no triple 20 because the trees had become  deficit in calcium.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:30">0:48:30-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  And over time, I was putting on more calcium.  I was putting on more sodium than I ever could have  possibly imagined.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:46</a>:</strong>  And I was putting on no potassium  and no very little if any zinc.  And that was a big surprise to me<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:46">0:48:46-0:48:57</a>:</strong>  because our baseline program was actually harming  our genetic potential of the trees  to generate the returns that we want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:48:58">0:48:58-0:49:07</a>:</strong>  And that was a surprise to me.  I would have known that I was actually taking away  from the potential of the tree<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:07">0:49:07-0:49:15</a>:</strong>  unless I had done sap analysis.  So that was a big surprise.  But things change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:28</a>:</strong>  I think it was Bill Gates who said something like,  people generally overestimate what they can do in one year  and underestimate what they can do in 10 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:28">0:49:28-0:49:41</a>:</strong>  And I kind of love that saying because  as we've gone through time,  we see things happening in a sap analysis<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:41">0:49:41-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  that are surprising.  And so for example, I was mentioning that we applied  lots and lots of calcium<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:59</a>:</strong>  when we first started this process years ago.  What we see now is actually our calcium levels,  for example, in 2018,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:49:59">0:49:59-0:50:08</a>:</strong>  our calcium levels were actually quite good.  I never thought I would have said that  given the challenge of how much calcium we've put on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:08">0:50:08-0:50:16</a>:</strong>  But the various activities that we've been doing  with focusing on our soil  and our foliar nutrition based on sap analysis,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:17">0:50:17-0:50:23</a>:</strong>  we've gotten our calcium levels up  to where I'm comfortable with them.  And believe it or not,<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:34">0:50:34-0:50:45</a>:</strong>  in the last growing season at a point where we needed them.  I found myself actually putting on a large amount of nitrogen  relative to what we've done in the past<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:45">0:50:45-0:50:55</a>:</strong>  because our nitrogen levels weren't high.  We needed them to be higher.  And boy, that was a big surprise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:50:55">0:50:55-0:51:03</a>:</strong>  But again, I never would have done the right thing  and put on nitrogen  and backed off of our calcium applications<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:51:03">0:51:03-0:51:15</a>:</strong>  had I not had the sap analysis right there in front of me,  showing me the trends in those two nutrients  and having me be able to take action to correct them.<br />

And then they tell themselves that they're never wrong.<br />

My fruit is anonymous in the marketplace.  The only thing that my fruit has to speak for itself<br />

Because of that competitiveness in the market,  I have to make sure that I am very efficiently<br />

I don't receive a special premium for my product  because it's a unique brand and consumers want that brand.<br />

And they oftentimes require higher levels<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:53:54">0:53:54-0:54:02</a>:</strong>  of management and labor, which of course  are two of the more expensive things  for one doing business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:54:02">0:54:02-0:54:14</a>:</strong>  But by doing SAP analysis, I am able to make sure  that I'm hitting the mark with these techniques  to the best of our ability.<br />

And you also mentioned nutrient applications,<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:31">0:55:31-0:55:40</a>:</strong>  that you're describing.  How do those compare with the use of soil covers?  I think that there is,<br />

The lands that I farm, my family lands that I farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:55:58">0:55:58-0:56:11</a>:</strong>  have been in my family for over a hundred years  and they've been farmed for well over a hundred years.  They are not native undisturbed soils.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:56:53">0:56:53-0:57:04</a>:</strong>  That sort of sounds like the Garden of Eden for plants.  Instead, what I have is I have tired old soils  that we need to restore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:06">0:57:06-0:57:16</a>:</strong>  If I were to do that only with mulches  and covering the soil up and mowing, blowing our cover crop,  as patient a person I am,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:16">0:57:16-0:57:28</a>:</strong>  because I view this as a long game, I'm not that patient.  I don't know if in my working lifetime,  we would be able to accomplish what I want to accomplish<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:28">0:57:28-0:57:39</a>:</strong>  and have the economic return that I wanna have  just by mowing and blowing mulches onto the soils.  I think you said this, John,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:39">0:57:39-0:57:48</a>:</strong>  one of the fastest ways for us to improve our soils  is to have the crop that's growing in them  be doing the improvement for us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:57:48">0:57:48-0:58:03</a>:</strong>  And so I view the tree as the conduit for putting carbon  into our soils at a much higher rate  than what I can do with mow and blow<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:03">0:58:03-0:58:12</a>:</strong>  and with applying mulches.  Even if I were to truck hundreds and thousands  of yards worth of mulch, wood mulch or compost mulch<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:12">0:58:12-0:58:23</a>:</strong>  onto my soil, I really couldn't accomplish  as much as that tree does.  And so I view the nutrient applications as twofold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:25">0:58:25-0:58:36</a>:</strong>  One is that, of course, with nutrient applications  and calibrating those based on sap analysis,  I'm able to make sure that I get as close as I can<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:36">0:58:36-0:58:48</a>:</strong>  to the genetic maximum potential of the cherry  in the given climate that it's growing in for that season.  And I'm able to do that by growing as big a leaves<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:58:48">0:58:48-0:59:02</a>:</strong>  and as big a canopy on my tree as possible.  The engine for sizing fruit is the canopy of the tree.  And that means big leaves, lots of surface area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:02">0:59:02-0:59:11</a>:</strong>  That can be accomplished much quicker  with foliar applications than any mow and blow.  I mow and blow a few times,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:11">0:59:11-0:59:22</a>:</strong>  a handful of times a year is when that mower is passing by.  However, I can apply nutrients through foliar  or through fertigation every couple of days,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:22">0:59:22-0:59:30</a>:</strong>  which is what we actually do in the case of fertigation.  And I'm able to size those leaves up big.  But the other thing that that big canopy does<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:30">0:59:30-0:59:44</a>:</strong>  besides grow this year's crop is it invests in future crops  by contributing carbon and other nutrients  into the rhizosphere in building the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:44">0:59:44-0:59:55</a>:</strong>  So the tree is simultaneously generating the crop  that's going to pay the bills and put food on the table  and money in the college fund for my kids.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=0:59:56">0:59:56-1:00:07</a>:</strong>  It's at the same time, it's putting its own bank  into the soil and building its future.  So the tree is building my future<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:07">1:00:07-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  with the crop I'm gonna harvest.  And it's also building its own future  by boosting nutrients into the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:23</a>:</strong>  And I think that foliar applications  and fertigation applications that we do,  those nutrients that we apply need to be viewed<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:23">1:00:23-1:00:37</a>:</strong>  as both near term and long term investment.  And so we continue to do foliar and fertigation  onto our trees even after the crop has been picked<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:37">1:00:37-1:00:47</a>:</strong>  because we're growing next year's crop.  And so we fertigate and we apply foliar nutrition  based on sap analysis that we continue<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:00:47">1:00:47-1:00:55</a>:</strong>  even after the cherries are off the tree  because we're growing future crops.  Mike, you've been doing many different things.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:11">1:01:11-1:01:17</a>:</strong>  We started this conversation by mentioning a desire  to develop the root systems.  What has changed with root systems?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:17">1:01:17-1:01:26</a>:</strong>  What has changed with tree health?  What have you actually observed in the field?  One of the things that I have some anecdotes<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:26">1:01:26-1:01:35</a>:</strong>  and then I have some actual data to share.  So we'll start with the anecdotes.  In November of 2014,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:35">1:01:35-1:01:49</a>:</strong>  we had one of those once in a lifetime historic freezes  that you may have just experienced in Ohio, John, recently,  where in November, the lowest the temperature had been<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:49">1:01:49-1:01:59</a>:</strong>  was 43 degrees.  And our trees generally go into dormancy about November,  but it had been a very warm fall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:01:59">1:01:59-1:02:10</a>:</strong>  And you might say early winter.  And the trees were still actively growing.  We hadn't had any acclimation of cold hardiness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:10">1:02:10-1:02:21</a>:</strong>  And then we had an Arctic front come down  and we went from lows of in the 40s  to below zero in one day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:22">1:02:22-1:02:33</a>:</strong>  And it stayed below zero.  And here at my house, we had negative four degrees Fahrenheit.  And the leaves on the trees just turned black,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:35">1:02:35-1:02:46</a>:</strong>  just like a dahlia plant looks after the first frost.  The leaves turned black and they just hung on the trees.  And we had in our area,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:46">1:02:46-1:02:59</a>:</strong>  several hundred acres of trees that just died.  We had blocks where all the buds were frozen on the trees.  But at that time, I was doing some comparison analysis<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:02:59">1:02:59-1:03:11</a>:</strong>  between, I'm gonna say mulch  and intensive bio-nutrition applications  and conventional applications for management of the orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:11">1:03:11-1:03:19</a>:</strong>  And so I had two orchards that were sitting  within a quarter mile of each other at the same elevation.  One was on one side of a small canyon<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:19">1:03:19-1:03:25</a>:</strong>  and one was on the other side of the small canyon.  They were the same age and variety of trees  same irrigation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:25">1:03:25-1:03:34</a>:</strong>  The only difference between them  was the nutrition management.  One had been, had compost, had mulch,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:34">1:03:34-1:03:42</a>:</strong>  had bio-intensive nutrition applied.  And the other orchard was just  a standard conventional orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:43">1:03:43-1:03:53</a>:</strong>  After that freeze, all the trees  in the conventional orchard were killed or were dead.  They froze out the orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:03:53">1:03:53-1:04:02</a>:</strong>  They froze out the entire canopy was killed.  We could have regrown them from the roots  but the trees were dead down to the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:02">1:04:02-1:04:11</a>:</strong>  And they'd been killed.  The entire orchard was smoked.  There wasn't one tree that was left.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:11">1:04:11-1:04:20</a>:</strong>  When you went and cut bark, it was black underneath  instead of bright green.  And I had to remove that orchard that following spring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:20">1:04:20-1:04:33</a>:</strong>  The orchard where we'd been following  these bio-intensive practices, believe it or not,  had 110% of a normal crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:33">1:04:33-1:04:46</a>:</strong>  So we actually picked 10% more fruit out of that orchard  than we did the previous year.  And that truly amazed me because I couldn't believe it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:46">1:04:46-1:04:56</a>:</strong>  That difference was only due to the nutrition management  and these other activities that we were doing.  There was no other difference there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:04:56">1:04:56-1:05:09</a>:</strong>  And that really shocked me.  The other thing that we've observed over time  is a marked reduction in two pathogens<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:10">1:05:10-1:05:17</a>:</strong>  that are problems for us, two diseases  that are problems for us in cherries.  One of them is bacterial canker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:17">1:05:17-1:05:28</a>:</strong>  Bacterial canker causes cherry trees to eventually die.  They create a lot of gum.  So they get a canker that has a swelling of sap<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:28">1:05:28-1:05:36</a>:</strong>  under the bark.  And then these cankers burst almost like a blister  and sap oozes out of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:39">1:05:39-1:05:50</a>:</strong>  That disease is a particular challenge  with certain varieties and certain rootstocks of trees.  And we have to avoid certain varieties<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:05:50">1:05:50-1:06:00</a>:</strong>  and certain rootstocks of trees  because we just really can't get them to ever grow very well  because the trees get plagued by bacterial canker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:00">1:06:00-1:06:10</a>:</strong>  And if it doesn't wipe the orchard out,  it takes enough trees out of the block  that you lose the value of that block as an economic unit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:10">1:06:10-1:06:22</a>:</strong>  So say 20% of the block maybe is killed by bacterial canker,  that remaining 80% can never perform  at the level we need to remain competitive<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:22">1:06:22-1:06:31</a>:</strong>  because you're missing 20% of the trees in there.  And you can try to replant them,  but the baby trees you put in to that existing block<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:31">1:06:31-1:06:41</a>:</strong>  succumb to bacterial canker.  So one of the challenges that I faced was this disease.  And the consultant said,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:41">1:06:41-1:06:50</a>:</strong>  advancing eco-agriculture that I work with  started to tell me that we should try  to take on this disease of bacterial canker<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:06:50">1:06:50-1:07:01</a>:</strong>  by focusing on the nutrition.  And over time, we had an amazing transformation in the block  that had significant amounts of bacterial canker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:01">1:07:01-1:07:13</a>:</strong>  Enough I was going to take the block out.  But I left it there because I didn't have anything to lose.  And what we found was that the bacterial canker<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:13">1:07:13-1:07:24</a>:</strong>  was actually eliminated from the block.  It wasn't just reduced, it was actually eliminated.  Virtually all of the trees in that block<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:24">1:07:24-1:07:33</a>:</strong>  had one or more canker sites on them.  Some were far worse than others,  but almost every tree had at least one canker on it growing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:33">1:07:33-1:07:42</a>:</strong>  And what we found is,  I think it was by the third or fourth year,  we could not find bacterial canker in that block.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:42">1:07:42-1:07:52</a>:</strong>  I had neighbors coming to the block.  I had extension staff and research pathologists  from Oregon State coming to that block.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:07:52">1:07:52-1:08:03</a>:</strong>  And they could not believe the change in the block  that there was not canker there.  A second disease that's more problematic in cherries<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:03">1:08:03-1:08:10</a>:</strong>  is powdery mildew.  That disease affects the foliage and fruit.  And it's a real challenge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:10">1:08:10-1:08:21</a>:</strong>  Powdery mildew is the disease that is targeted  by almost all of the fungicides applications  that are applied in conventional<br />

And what we've seen is that highly susceptible varieties  that normally would require extra powdery mildew applications<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:08:37">1:08:37-1:08:47</a>:</strong>  actually we've been able to reduce our applications by half.  And maybe I could reduce them by more.  I'm just a bit nervous about reducing them by more.<br />

And this is another thing that neighbors couldn't believe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:00">1:09:00-1:09:11</a>:</strong>  So we actually had a walking tour through that block  that was hosted by, well, we've had a couple of them.  One of them was hosted by extension.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:11">1:09:11-1:09:21</a>:</strong>  And I made a bet with the neighbors there.  I said, can you go find any mildew in this block  and I'll buy you a steak dinner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:21">1:09:21-1:09:30</a>:</strong>  Actually, I have never had to buy a steak dinner  because folks cannot find mildew in that orchard.  And a typical orchard with that variety on it<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:30">1:09:30-1:09:36</a>:</strong>  would have lots of mildew  because even with fungicide applications,  we're not able to control it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:36">1:09:36-1:09:49</a>:</strong>  So those are two things that we've observed  that I honestly thought we would never get to  where through nutrition,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:09:49">1:09:49-1:10:02</a>:</strong>  we're able to manage our diseases in this case  with bacterial canker and with powdery mildew.  I was really shocked by that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:02">1:10:02-1:10:15</a>:</strong>  And to me, it speaks to the value to the tree  in the long-term value to the orchard  of providing the nutrition that the tree needs<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:15">1:10:15-1:10:22</a>:</strong>  and the tree will take care of itself.  Mike, these are some extraordinary anecdotes.  Thank you very much for sharing them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:22">1:10:22-1:10:32</a>:</strong>  I think I'm certainly inspired by hearing these stories  because we've heard many of the leaders  of the biological agriculture space saying for decades,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:32">1:10:32-1:10:42</a>:</strong>  I mean, William Albrecht back in the 1940s  used to say that insects are nature's garbage collectors  and diseases were here to take the unhealthy plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:42">1:10:42-1:10:46</a>:</strong>  out of the system.  So it's encouraging to hear  that we can actually manage plant nutrition<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:46">1:10:46-1:10:53</a>:</strong>  and produce these effects.  You mentioned that you also have some data.  I'm not sure what the data is in regards to,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:10:53">1:10:53-1:11:02</a>:</strong>  but I would also love to learn more about  what were the effects that you observed in fruit itself?  There's the health of the tree component,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:02">1:11:02-1:11:10</a>:</strong>  but how did managing nutrition affect fruit quality for you?  That's a good question, John.  It brings me back to the numbers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:10">1:11:10-1:11:20</a>:</strong>  The anecdotes are always fun to talk about,  but the data is too.  So I believe in measuring and not just in sap analysis,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:22">1:11:22-1:11:36</a>:</strong>  of course, but I believe in measuring results  of the management activities that we do on our farm.  I think it's incredibly important for us to be observers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:38">1:11:38-1:11:51</a>:</strong>  I think farmers need to be observers,  but I also think that farmers need to be engineers  in the fact that if we don't measure,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:11:51">1:11:51-1:12:01</a>:</strong>  we'll never really know for sure.  So on our farm over the years,  we collect lots of data and we continue to do so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:01">1:12:01-1:12:09</a>:</strong>  And in particular, we collect data on the size  and firmness of our cherries,  because those are the two primary criteria<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:09">1:12:09-1:12:18</a>:</strong>  that base the price that we're gonna receive per pound  for our fruit.  And what we have consistently seen over time<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:18">1:12:18-1:12:36</a>:</strong>  is that when we apply biointensive management practices,  we have a higher quality of fruit in size and in firmness,  because those are two easy things for us to measure<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:36">1:12:36-1:12:44</a>:</strong>  because we can take a sample  and we can measure the size and the firmness.  And in general, across varieties<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:44">1:12:44-1:12:58</a>:</strong>  and across management techniques,  we can increase our fruit by one half row size consistently.  And oftentimes we can boost our fruit by one row size,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:12:58">1:12:58-1:13:12</a>:</strong>  which is the gauge of which you measure cherry fruit size.  We also have our fruit be significantly firmer,  raising our firmness upwards of 50 to 100 grams<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:13">1:13:13-1:13:25</a>:</strong>  per millimeter of pressure when we examine the fruit.  So those two factors,  we have rings of data on increasing our size and firmness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:26">1:13:26-1:13:41</a>:</strong>  But what we have seen on a per acre basis  is that we fairly consistently return,  our net return on investment with these practices<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:41">1:13:41-1:13:57</a>:</strong>  in cherries is somewhere between 800 and $2,100 per acre.  It depends on the variety and it depends on the year.  But that's the net difference in our return<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:13:57">1:13:57-1:14:08</a>:</strong>  after we take our expenses of the biointensive practices out.  When we back those out,  if we look at what an acre of biointensive cherries returns<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:08">1:14:08-1:14:19</a>:</strong>  versus an acre that we farm conventionally,  we're consistently between $800 and $2,100 ahead  as profit for ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:19">1:14:19-1:14:34</a>:</strong>  So those are real numbers and that really gets my attention.  And I like it because it's good to do something  that is interesting to me as a farmer, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:34">1:14:34-1:14:43</a>:</strong>  and exciting, but also pays the bills and pays them well.  That's a win-win.  Mike, you've described some phenomenals,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:43">1:14:43-1:14:51</a>:</strong>  some extraordinary stories and anecdotes  with the freeze protection, et cetera,  of all those surprises that you've had on your journey<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:14:51">1:14:51-1:15:03</a>:</strong>  as you've experimented with these various approaches.  What was the most unexpected?  You know, I'm gonna wrap you into this story, John.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:05">1:15:05-1:15:22</a>:</strong>  When you and I first met, however long ago it's been now,  I remember I was incredibly impressed with your knowledge  and really connected with you as a person and as a farmer.<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:34">1:15:34-1:15:47</a>:</strong>  until you told me that I could reduce mildew  and bacterial canker to zero.  That's when I doubted you, John,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:47">1:15:47-1:15:57</a>:</strong>  because I thought never in a million years  will that happen.  And I had Albrecht's writings<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:15:57">1:15:57-1:16:04</a>:</strong>  and the writings of many other pioneers  that have come before you and me, John,  not that I'm a pioneer, but you sure are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:05">1:16:05-1:16:18</a>:</strong>  I always thought that they're drinking the Kool-Aid on that.  That's never gonna happen.  And boy, I was wrong and surprised<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:18">1:16:18-1:16:27</a>:</strong>  when we were able to back that off.  I was really confident we could make the fruit bigger.  I was really confident that we could generate higher yields,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:27">1:16:27-1:16:34</a>:</strong>  which we've been able to do,  but I never thought we'd knock down  powdery mildew and bacterial canker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:16:35">1:16:35-1:16:45</a>:</strong>  And I'm still cautious about them,  but boy, that's probably the biggest surprise for sure, John.  Good, well, thanks for the compliments contained within that.<br />

What is a book or resource that you would recommend<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:01">1:17:01-1:17:08</a>:</strong>  that everyone needs to read to become more immersed  or other things people need to consider  that perhaps we haven't spoken about?<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:08">1:17:08-1:17:19</a>:</strong>  Well, since you're asking one, I can't answer.  So I'm gonna answer with two.  YouTube has been invaluable to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:20">1:17:20-1:17:29</a>:</strong>  I think books, I love books,  and every place where there's room for a book,  there's one there, and I love to read<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:29">1:17:29-1:17:38</a>:</strong>  and it's very important.  But one of the hard things for me in books  is by the time the book gets out there,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:38">1:17:38-1:17:49</a>:</strong>  I sometimes feel that maybe the information,  the actionable information can become a bit dated.  And so I use YouTube a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:17:49">1:17:49-1:18:01</a>:</strong>  There is an amazing amount of information on YouTube.  One of the things that we did  to make that really effective active compost on our farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:01">1:18:01-1:18:10</a>:</strong>  is introduced a lot of vermicompost techniques  to that process.  I learned that all on YouTube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:10">1:18:10-1:18:17</a>:</strong>  Whether it's fabricating a piece of equipment  or doing something a little different,  YouTube is a great resource.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:17">1:18:17-1:18:30</a>:</strong>  But since I love books, I have to include a book  and it might sound a little bit obtuse,  but I love to read really old books<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:30">1:18:30-1:18:43</a>:</strong>  from the 20s and 30s about how people ran their farms  when they were where there were integrated livestock  and row crop production together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:43">1:18:43-1:18:53</a>:</strong>  And I really liked books that focus upon  not just the love and romance of farming,  but the business of farming from that era.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:18:53">1:18:53-1:19:03</a>:</strong>  And there's a great book that I love and I read it,  oh, every year or two.  And it's called The Farming Ladder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:04">1:19:04-1:19:15</a>:</strong>  And it's written by a gentleman named Henderson  and it describes his farm in England, Oat Hill Farm,  and how they ran the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:15">1:19:15-1:19:25</a>:</strong>  They had horses, they had poultry and cattle and sheep,  and they cut hay and oats,  and they had barns in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:25">1:19:25-1:19:38</a>:</strong>  And the focus in that book is just really, really neat  because he talks about keys to his success  in not just applying the art and love of farming,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:19:38">1:19:38-1:19:48</a>:</strong>  but the business aspects of farming.  And I really enjoy that book.  So I would suggest everybody find it on,<br />

<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:24">1:20:24-1:20:30</a>:</strong>  of the last decade or so.  And there's this one question,  which I think is very important for us to ask<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:30">1:20:30-1:20:39</a>:</strong>  and to think about.  Today, what is it that you believe to be true  about modern agriculture, about modern fruit production<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:39">1:20:39-1:20:59</a>:</strong>  that is perhaps different from the mainstream view?  I think if I consider the mainstream view  to be conventional agriculture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:20:59">1:20:59-1:21:14</a>:</strong>  I think the thing that is different  is that biologically intensive practices  are not antagonistic to large scale agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:18">1:21:18-1:21:30</a>:</strong>  I don't believe that large scale agriculture  and bio-intensive and regenerative practices  are mutually exclusive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://podcast.vhostevents.com/uncategorized/the-regenerative-orchard-cherry-success-with-mike-omeg/#t=1:21:30">1:21:30-1:21:47</a>:</strong>  On my farm, we farmed 350 acres  and we were able to implement practices  that were done on people with a third of an acre<br />
