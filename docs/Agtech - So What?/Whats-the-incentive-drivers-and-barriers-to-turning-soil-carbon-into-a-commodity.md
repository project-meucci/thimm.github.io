### Agtech - So What?  (Wed, 07 Apr 2021 22:38:00)
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:00):**  Hello, and welcome back to Ag Tech So What, brought to you by the Agthentic Group.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:06):**  I'm your host, Sarah Nolet.  
**[0:00:08-0:00:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:08):**  If you're paying attention to ag tech these days, you're hearing a lot about carbon.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:12):**  But let's face it, as interest grows and more tech and capital flow into this space, it's  
**[0:00:17-0:00:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:17):**  increasingly confusing, complex, and even sometimes contentious.  
**[0:00:21-0:00:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:21):**  And there's some big open questions like, how do we get more farmers to participate?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:26):**  How can we ensure that what we're incentivizing is actually good for the environment?  
**[0:00:30-0:00:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:30):**  And who should bear the cost of practice changes?  
**[0:00:33-0:00:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:33):**  We've dug into soil carbon before on the podcast, but wanted to revisit it.  
**[0:00:36-0:00:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:36):**  And in particular, a key question, what's the incentive?  
**[0:00:40-0:00:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:40):**  Basically, how do we and should we make ecosystem services markets easier to measure, access  
**[0:00:46-0:00:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:46):**  and understand?  
**[0:00:47-0:00:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:47):**  It's in a state of rapid maturing of all of that.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:53):**  That's Richard Heath, executive director at the Australian Farm Institute, an ag policy  
**[0:00:57-0:00:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:57):**  think tank here in Australia.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:00:59):**  Which is why it's confusing at the moment, why it seems like that there's lots of different  
**[0:01:03-0:01:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:03):**  metrics and lots of different systems that are being talked about.  
**[0:01:06-0:01:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:06):**  But it will coalesce over time.  
**[0:01:09-0:01:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:09):**  It's just the way that markets work, how we get there more quickly and how we do it in  
**[0:01:12-0:01:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:12):**  a way that makes sense for farmers and farm businesses to participate equitably.  
**[0:01:19-0:01:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:19):**  That's the challenge.  
**[0:01:21-0:01:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:21):**  On the panel, which was originally recorded live as part of an Australian AgriTech Association  
**[0:01:25-0:01:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:25):**  meet up, you'll also hear from Rob Waterworth, CEO of ag tech startup FlintPro.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:30):**  I'd also say that a lot of the things that we're seeing at the moment have also been  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:34):**  thought about in the 90s and the 2000s.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:37):**  And we've cycled around them a number of times.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:39):**  So while there is certainly new technology and new thinking, a lot of the policy issues  
**[0:01:43-0:01:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:43):**  that are actually being faced have been addressed for a long time.  
**[0:01:47-0:01:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:47):**  And while Rob's right, some of these issues have been around for a while.  
**[0:01:51-0:01:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:51):**  One thing that's changed is that big food and ag companies are paying serious attention  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:55):**  to soil carbon.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:01:56):**  Paul Schooller is a strategic sourcing manager from Mars in their pet care division, running  
**[0:02:01-0:02:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:01):**  a program for growers to help them measure and increase soil carbon.  
**[0:02:04-0:02:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:04):**  If the growers don't trust us, if they just see us as corporations trying to make themselves  
**[0:02:10-0:02:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:10):**  look better, we know we're only going to get limited benefits.  
**[0:02:13-0:02:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:13):**  So these farming groups are a core to our success.  
**[0:02:18-0:02:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:18):**  We start with each panelist outlining what they see as the biggest hurdles and opportunities  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:22):**  in this space.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:23):**  Here's Richard, who used to be a farmer himself, on the three broad market influences creating  
**[0:02:28-0:02:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:28):**  participation and incentive pathways.  
**[0:02:31-0:02:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:31):**  The first being commitment, international commitments, and the obvious one there being  
**[0:02:36-0:02:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:36):**  the Paris Agreement that we are signed up to as a country.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:40):**  Now the incentive mechanism is the emissions reduction fund.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:43):**  The other big market influence is corporate risk.  
**[0:02:46-0:02:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:46):**  And this is one that is increasingly important and having an increasing impact on—and sometimes  
**[0:02:54-0:03:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:02:54):**  quite insidiously that a lot of farm businesses wouldn't necessarily be realising, but through  
**[0:03:00-0:03:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:00):**  the way that banks interact with them, insurance companies, even big multinational supply chain  
**[0:03:06-0:03:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:06):**  companies that are managing, that are required to manage and mitigate their risk around things  
**[0:03:12-0:03:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:12):**  like climate change.  
**[0:03:13-0:03:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:13):**  There are some really big global programs like the Taskforce for Climate Financial Disclosure  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:19):**  and the Taskforce for Nature Financial Disclosure, which are starting to determine the way that  
**[0:03:26-0:03:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:26):**  most companies assess and deal with sustainability risk.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:32):**  A mechanism that that's being applied through here is now the Accounting for Nature Framework,  
**[0:03:38-0:03:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:38):**  but there are many others and it's a rapidly developing field.  
**[0:03:43-0:03:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:43):**  Then the final C is consumers, obviously.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:47):**  Consumers have a real interest in sustainability and are increasingly prepared to pay more  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:03:54):**  and reflect their behaviour or change their behaviour around wanting to have sustainability  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:00):**  outcomes.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:01):**  And that's where industry frameworks like the Better Cotton Initiative, for instance,  
**[0:04:05-0:04:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:05):**  come into play.  
**[0:04:07-0:04:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:07):**  And often the most direct way that farm businesses will interact is through an industry framework  
**[0:04:14-0:04:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:14):**  that has been driven a lot by consumer perceptions and consumer demand.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:19):**  The three market influences Richard has outlined—government commitments, corporate risk and consumers—all  
**[0:04:24-0:04:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:24):**  overlap.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:25):**  And this is in part why the space is so confusing.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:28):**  It's just not clear how to participate.  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:31):**  The Paris commitments and the Paris framework is informing the way that a lot of corporates  
**[0:04:37-0:04:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:37):**  will offset their risk or manage their risk.  
**[0:04:40-0:04:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:40):**  They'll be doing it through the sorts of frameworks that have been set up to deliver  
**[0:04:44-0:04:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:44):**  on international agreements.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:47):**  But for all of those, there is one outcome.  
**[0:04:52-0:04:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:52):**  If we focus on carbon and soil, it is essentially all about sequestering carbon.  
**[0:04:58-0:05:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:04:58):**  So no matter how fuzzy the incentive pathway is, where it's coming from, the end result,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:05):**  the desirable outcome, is that a tonne of carbon dioxide is sequestered or multiples  
**[0:05:11-0:05:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:11):**  off.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:12):**  If we think again about how much they overlap and where the incentive pathways are going  
**[0:05:18-0:05:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:18):**  to occur in those, and we look at those three that I mentioned, the Better Cotton Initiative  
**[0:05:25-0:05:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:25):**  helps you to deliver against corporate risk with a consumer focus.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:31):**  The Emissions Reduction Fund is about delivering on international commitments, but is also  
**[0:05:36-0:05:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:36):**  providing offsetting mechanisms that corporate risk can be mitigated.  
**[0:05:41-0:05:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:41):**  Accounting for Nature, which is a natural capital measurement system, sits right in  
**[0:05:45-0:05:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:45):**  the middle of all of those.  
**[0:05:47-0:05:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:47):**  So again, you look at that as a farm business sort of wondering how to participate, wondering  
**[0:05:52-0:05:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:52):**  where the incentive is, and it's a mess.  
**[0:05:56-0:06:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:05:56):**  There's all sorts of pathways, it's overlapping thin diagram of possibilities.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:03):**  So how do we move towards that outcome focus that makes things a bit more consistent, makes  
**[0:06:09-0:06:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:09):**  things a bit more clearer in terms of what you're trying to do that make the incentives  
**[0:06:13-0:06:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:13):**  make more sense?  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:15):**  What we need is consistency, compatibility of indicators, metrics and targets, so that  
**[0:06:20-0:06:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:20):**  one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent is one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent regardless  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:26):**  of the incentive.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:28):**  It's being measured the same, it's being described the same way, it's clearly recognised  
**[0:06:34-0:06:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:34):**  as a farm business that lets you participate in multiple incentive pathways, and there's  
**[0:06:39-0:06:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:39):**  no barrier between switching pathways, because it is all using the same language and there's  
**[0:06:44-0:06:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:44):**  consistency there.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:46):**  So if the outcome is the focus, then that makes that more likely that we're going to  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:52):**  get there.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:53):**  Rather than thinking about practices to do it, if we're thinking about the outcome, then  
**[0:06:57-0:07:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:06:57):**  it's more likely that we get that consistency and compatibility across all those incentive  
**[0:07:01-0:07:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:01):**  pathways.  
**[0:07:02-0:07:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:02):**  But I want to make it clear, and we'll get to this more in the discussion, that it should  
**[0:07:08-0:07:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:08):**  not be the sole focus.  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:10):**  There is the real potential for perverse and distortionary outcomes if a single outcome  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:17):**  does become the focus and a whole market and a reward pathway builds up around delivering  
**[0:07:23-0:07:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:23):**  a single outcome, even if that single outcome is sequestering carbon.  
**[0:07:28-0:07:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:28):**  Rob from FlintPro has a similar view, but starts by digging into the why.  
**[0:07:32-0:07:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:32):**  Why farmers, corporates and governments want to get involved in soil carbon.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:37):**  So we've been involved in carbon accounting now for over 20 years.  
**[0:07:41-0:07:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:41):**  Mainly we started off working in designing and building Australia's national carbon accounting  
**[0:07:45-0:07:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:45):**  systems.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:46):**  I think the fascinating part is that over that time, we've seen lots of different changes  
**[0:07:51-0:07:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:51):**  in this market.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:52):**  But I always try to bring it back to what we call the Ken principle.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:07:56):**  And Ken is simple from our perspective, is there's really three reasons for doing this.  
**[0:08:01-0:08:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:01):**  You're either trying to keep access to your existing markets, you're trying to expand  
**[0:08:06-0:08:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:06):**  into your existing markets more through gaining competitive advantage, or you're looking for  
**[0:08:10-0:08:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:10):**  new markets.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:12):**  And if you break it up into those three, you can start to see people falling into all,  
**[0:08:16-0:08:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:16):**  sometimes all those categories, sometimes the first one, and we're obviously recently  
**[0:08:20-0:08:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:20):**  a very strong focus on new market mechanisms of late, in particular, obviously, emissions  
**[0:08:26-0:08:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:26):**  trading, voluntary carbon standards and things.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:28):**  So it's a really interesting and evolving space.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:31):**  And I'd also say that a lot of the things that we're seeing at the moment have also  
**[0:08:35-0:08:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:35):**  been thought about in the 90s and the 2000s.  
**[0:08:38-0:08:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:38):**  And we've cycled around them a number of times.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:40):**  So while there is certainly new technology and new thinking, a lot of the policy issues  
**[0:08:44-0:08:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:44):**  that are actually being faced have been addressed for a long time.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:48):**  So obviously, I wouldn't be a CEO if I didn't plug our product.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:52):**  So very quickly, our main system that we've developed is Supercore Fleet Pro.  
**[0:08:57-0:08:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:57):**  I won't go too much into it.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:08:59):**  But it is an online system for integrating multiple streams of data for estimating all  
**[0:09:03-0:09:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:03):**  types of metrics.  
**[0:09:04-0:09:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:04):**  It has an initial focus on carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, but it's highly modular.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:10):**  And we've been looking at things like biodiversity and soil health and crops and a whole lot  
**[0:09:14-0:09:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:14):**  of other factors that the system can run.  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:17):**  There are three key things that we keep saying that we think are really important to look  
**[0:09:22-0:09:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:22):**  at.  
**[0:09:23-0:09:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:23):**  The first one is we need to start moving from tools to systems.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:26):**  And this comes to Richard's point about you don't want to have an outcome.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:29):**  There's lots of different things that can happen if you start focusing on an outcome  
**[0:09:33-0:09:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:33):**  only.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:34):**  And you can start with quite perverse results.  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:37):**  Also if you're actually starting to look at markets and other aspects, you can't just  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:40):**  have lots of little tools all just running separately.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:43):**  You actually need to have systems in place that can support that from paddock all the  
**[0:09:47-0:09:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:47):**  way through to the farm, to the farm enterprise, to large organisations, even up to the national  
**[0:09:51-0:09:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:51):**  scales and types of nesting issues.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:54):**  The second point is to start thinking about our metrics much more in terms of usefulness,  
**[0:09:59-0:10:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:09:59):**  metrics and data.  
**[0:10:00-0:10:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:00):**  So one of the things that always concerns me is that accuracy appears to be the metric  
**[0:10:04-0:10:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:04):**  that everyone talks about.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:06):**  Accuracy is an important aspect of any metric, but it is only one aspect.  
**[0:10:11-0:10:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:11):**  And it's actually one that has clouded our thinking very badly for the last 15 years  
**[0:10:16-0:10:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:16):**  and has often caused things to stall and stop as people have argued about whose map is slightly  
**[0:10:21-0:10:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:21):**  more accurate or whose model is slightly more accurate.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:24):**  That's actually not helping.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:26):**  We need to actually come up to understand and be very clear that what we're looking  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:30):**  for is a system that meets a set of performance criteria of which accuracy is only one.  
**[0:10:35-0:10:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:35):**  And I'm hoping that that actually sparks a bit of discussion because that's mildly controversial.  
**[0:10:41-0:10:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:41):**  And then the final point which comes across all of these, which is there is actually no  
**[0:10:45-0:10:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:45):**  silver bullet here.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:47):**  So there's lots of different metrics.  
**[0:10:49-0:10:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:49):**  There's lots of different systems.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:50):**  But the key is that you can't do everything with one.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:53):**  You can't do everything with remote sensing.  
**[0:10:55-0:10:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:55):**  You can't do everything with ground data.  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:56):**  You can't do everything with models.  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:58):**  The challenge is going to come.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:10:59):**  How do you integrate those in a sensible fashion to actually give you what you need?  
**[0:11:03-0:11:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:03):**  And if you look at it from an integration perspective, I think we're actually very close  
**[0:11:07-0:11:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:07):**  to the same.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:08):**  Now let's hear from Paul on how Mars is working with their suppliers on a project called the  
**[0:11:12-0:11:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:12):**  Cool Soil Initiative.  
**[0:11:14-0:11:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:14):**  So I'm from Mars.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:15):**  I'm not the CEO, but I will plug our products as well.  
**[0:11:18-0:11:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:18):**  So I'm from the pet care division.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:19):**  So you've heard of things like Pedigree, Chum, Whiskers, My Dog, those kind of brands.  
**[0:11:25-0:11:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:25):**  That's actually a really big part of Mars, not just the sexy stuff like the Mars bars  
**[0:11:28-0:11:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:28):**  and M&Ms.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:29):**  So it's a big part of what we do and a big part of what we buy is grains and cereal.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:35):**  So I want to talk a little bit about our project that we've got happening at the moment.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:38):**  And I guess the background to that is I'm privately by the Mars company and the Mars  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:43):**  family have got a very specific way of doing things, a very clear vision.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:47):**  And they've been on the sustainability check for quite a long time now.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:51):**  So from the Mars business, sustainability is the right thing to do.  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:56):**  There's a real social obligation to do that.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:11:59):**  But increasingly what we're saying is it's the profitable thing to do.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:02):**  The marketplace consumers and customers are demanding that the products they buy are clean,  
**[0:12:08-0:12:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:08):**  green, sustainable.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:09):**  They don't want to be associated with products that are going to harm the environment.  
**[0:12:12-0:12:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:12):**  So there's a couple of real pulls for Mars pet care.  
**[0:12:17-0:12:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:17):**  Mars has got really ambitious goals to be greenhouse gas free within a quite tight timeline.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:22):**  And when we look at our global footprint, the majority comes from the paddock.  
**[0:12:26-0:12:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:26):**  So meats are a big one for us, but grains and cereals are really closely behind.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:31):**  So we know we've got to be very active in that space.  
**[0:12:35-0:12:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:35):**  We know we can't go to the market with a stick and demand that they come out and reduce their  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:40):**  greenhouse gas.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:41):**  We've gone for a different approach.  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:43):**  We're working collaboratively with growers to improve their business, but also to reduce  
**[0:12:47-0:12:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:47):**  our footprint on the planet.  
**[0:12:49-0:12:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:49):**  The Cool Soil Initiative is a project where we're working with growers, we're working  
**[0:12:53-0:12:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:53):**  with the industry, we're working with university to come up with methodologies to identify  
**[0:12:59-0:13:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:12:59):**  the practices that contribute to greenhouse gas and contribute to sequestration of greenhouse  
**[0:13:04-0:13:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:04):**  gases as well.  
**[0:13:06-0:13:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:06):**  What we're trying to do is deliver a credible framework for the industry so we can support  
**[0:13:10-0:13:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:10):**  croppers in reduces of their greenhouse gas emissions.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:13):**  So long term sustainability, long term yield stability, really through science based practices,  
**[0:13:19-0:13:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:19):**  so agronomic strategies to increase soil health.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:23):**  So we've broken it down to three objectives.  
**[0:13:24-0:13:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:24):**  So the first one is to demonstrate relevance.  
**[0:13:27-0:13:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:27):**  And the way we're doing that, we're going through the different farming groups to get  
**[0:13:30-0:13:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:30):**  a real collaborative, get that peer group involved and getting real buy in.  
**[0:13:34-0:13:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:34):**  So it's quite timely this week we've been talking to our farming groups, Riverine Plains  
**[0:13:40-0:13:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:40):**  on Tuesday, Farmlink on Wednesday, Central West today, and really hearing their inputs,  
**[0:13:45-0:13:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:45):**  what's important to them.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:46):**  We're telling them what we're doing, but we're also listening to make sure that we've got  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:50):**  the right level of involvement.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:52):**  Develop the supporting platform of research and digital solutions.  
**[0:13:55-0:13:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:55):**  So we're using a product called the Cool Farm Tool, which has been generated in the United  
**[0:13:58-0:14:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:13:58):**  States, which is an online tool which helps growers understand what their carbon footprint  
**[0:14:03-0:14:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:03):**  is based on their inputs and their yields.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:07):**  We're also using spatial analysis through Charles Sturt University, and we're grabbing  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:11):**  all that data along with soil samples and creating a combined picture so the grower  
**[0:14:15-0:14:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:15):**  really understands how their land is performing, but also what the different practices, the  
**[0:14:22-0:14:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:22):**  impacts that they have on them as well.  
**[0:14:24-0:14:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:24):**  And the third objective is that the food industry partners have a clear feedback on their investment.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:29):**  So at the moment we've got Kellogg's, we've got Allied Pinnacle, we've got Menildra.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:34):**  So we've got some really big hitters in this space working on this project.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:38):**  And the key thing about this project, it's pretty competitive.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:40):**  So it's not about getting a leg up on competitors, although we would really like to, it's about  
**[0:14:46-0:14:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:46):**  how do we work together to get that critical mass going so we can really support this.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:51):**  And what we're finding is by coming together with these groups, we've got real good peer  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:55):**  support, we're learning in these meetings, we're developing that trust.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:14:59):**  And that's the key to this success.  
**[0:15:01-0:15:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:01):**  If the growers don't trust us, if they just see us as corporations trying to make themselves  
**[0:15:06-0:15:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:06):**  look better, we know we're only going to get limited benefits.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:09):**  So these farming groups are core to our success.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:13):**  Awesome.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:14):**  Thanks, Paul.  
**[0:15:15-0:15:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:15):**  And thanks to everyone for sharing their perspectives.  
**[0:15:16-0:15:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:16):**  We will jump into a bit of a discussion.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:19):**  So I guess I wanted to start with something Richard said around that there are, and I  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:23):**  think Rob mentioned it as well, potentially outcomes isn't the silver bullet.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:28):**  And actually it was interesting as we thought about structuring this discussion, there was  
**[0:15:32-0:15:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:32):**  a bit of an assumption maybe that we should move to outcomes based ecosystem services  
**[0:15:36-0:15:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:36):**  markets, but that's probably not the case or comes at least for the caveat.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:39):**  Richard, do you want to talk a little bit about what you mean there and what are some  
**[0:15:42-0:15:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:42):**  of those perverse incentives that can crop up?  
**[0:15:45-0:15:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:45):**  Well, so I might start with an example.  
**[0:15:48-0:15:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:48):**  If the outcome, if the payment system and the market is based on the sole outcome of  
**[0:15:54-0:16:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:15:54):**  sequestering carbon in soil and supposing there is an ability to measure so that it's  
**[0:16:01-0:16:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:01):**  just based on that, it is just based on measuring the concentration of carbon in soil and how  
**[0:16:06-0:16:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:06):**  that changes over time.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:08):**  One of the easiest ways to influence that is to compact your soil.  
**[0:16:11-0:16:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:11):**  If you compact your soil, you'll increase the carbon concentration in the way that it's  
**[0:16:16-0:16:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:16):**  measured.  
**[0:16:17-0:16:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:17):**  That is a perverse outcome.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:18):**  The way to get around that is to, you have to stack benefits or you have to deliver co-benefits  
**[0:16:25-0:16:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:25):**  or you have to recognise the practice that is sequestering the carbon in the soil rather  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:32):**  than just the outcome of having a higher concentration of carbon in the soil.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:37):**  So that's what I mean by perverse outcomes and potentially, and obviously most farmers  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:42):**  are not going to do that because that's a really stupid thing to do for a whole lot  
**[0:16:46-0:16:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:46):**  of other reasons.  
**[0:16:47-0:16:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:47):**  But it is demonstrating that the capacity is there to game the system if it is just  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:52):**  that focus on one outcome and one deliverable outcome.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:55):**  Yeah, speaking of farmer perspectives, Paul, you mentioned dealing with these different  
**[0:16:59-0:17:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:16:59):**  groups and things.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:00):**  What have you been hearing from farmers?  
**[0:17:02-0:17:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:02):**  What's the view in terms of boots on the ground from growers about this whole space?  
**[0:17:06-0:17:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:06):**  Yeah, so over the last three days, we've heard three clear messages coming out as to why  
**[0:17:12-0:17:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:12):**  growers really want to get involved in this program.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:14):**  The first is just the economics, the finance of their business.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:19):**  Growers know that if they've got healthier soils, they've got higher yields, it's better  
**[0:17:23-0:17:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:23):**  for them, they're getting more out of their crops, but also the consumer is pulling sustainable  
**[0:17:27-0:17:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:27):**  goods out of the marketplace.  
**[0:17:29-0:17:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:29):**  It makes them more attractive to sell their grain as well.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:33):**  From a policy point of view, growers know it's only a matter of time before the government's  
**[0:17:36-0:17:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:36):**  in their paddocks and telling them what to do and having a real interest in their carbon  
**[0:17:40-0:17:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:40):**  level.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:41):**  They really want to get ahead of that and get ahead of the curve so that when that does  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:46):**  come around, they're prepared and they've already got good practices in place.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:49):**  But probably the biggest thing that resonated and something I heard throughout the week,  
**[0:17:54-0:17:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:54):**  growers believe they're custodians of the land.  
**[0:17:56-0:18:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:17:56):**  The common theme is they want to return the land in a better way than they inherited.  
**[0:18:00-0:18:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:00):**  So there's three really good levers, positive levers that we can pull to get momentum in  
**[0:18:05-0:18:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:05):**  this space.  
**[0:18:06-0:18:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:06):**  Ultimately, where we see this going is growers realise the benefit for these practices and  
**[0:18:12-0:18:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:12):**  they see this as a part of improving their business as well.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:15):**  So while we don't have any vision of cutting this program off in the near future, in fact,  
**[0:18:20-0:18:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:20):**  we don't have an end date for this project, the success of this project will depend on  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:25):**  these practices being incorporated into a farmer's business to make it a profitable  
**[0:18:29-0:18:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:29):**  business.  
**[0:18:30-0:18:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:30):**  And do you see that continuing long term, like they're seeing the kind of co-benefits  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:34):**  or private benefits as well of some of these practices and so the expectation is they'll  
**[0:18:37-0:18:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:37):**  keep doing it long term without government intervention?  
**[0:18:41-0:18:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:41):**  Well, that's the feedback we're getting from the growers.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:44):**  The growers, I guess they're a little bit sceptical because they want proof that these  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:50):**  practices work.  
**[0:18:51-0:18:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:51):**  And to be honest, we're four years into this project, we've only got four data sets over  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:55):**  four different crops.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:18:56):**  So we're still early getting this data as well.  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:00):**  But the overwhelming feeling from growers is we want the proof so we can pick this up  
**[0:19:05-0:19:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:05):**  and run with it long term.  
**[0:19:07-0:19:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:07):**  Rob, you're nodding.  
**[0:19:09-0:19:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:09):**  What do you think?  
**[0:19:10-0:19:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:10):**  No, look, I totally agree.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:12):**  And I think the other point that Paul was raising there in particular is around this  
**[0:19:15-0:19:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:15):**  custodianship and soil health and actually increasing productivity.  
**[0:19:19-0:19:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:19):**  I think to me, this is it's such an obvious thing that is why you're making most of these  
**[0:19:24-0:19:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:24):**  practices.  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:25):**  Soil carbon is a really important aspect.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:27):**  It may be entering into a new market that may be useful.  
**[0:19:30-0:19:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:30):**  But realistically, if you can get more production by doing these practices, then that's probably  
**[0:19:34-0:19:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:34):**  where the vast majority of your profits actually going to come from.  
**[0:19:37-0:19:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:37):**  It's going to be better quality and higher yield crops.  
**[0:19:41-0:19:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:41):**  And the soils is a bit of a benefit.  
**[0:19:43-0:19:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:43):**  And of course, we want to gain all the benefits as much as possible.  
**[0:19:45-0:19:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:45):**  And increasing farm income for sustainability is very important.  
**[0:19:49-0:19:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:49):**  But we need to keep our focus on the main game.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:52):**  Richard, you're nodding there on some of the points around metrics and measuring.  
**[0:19:56-0:20:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:19:56):**  But that's a pretty tough nut to crack still in terms of actually getting metrics that  
**[0:20:00-0:20:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:00):**  people agree on.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:01):**  Do you want to talk a little bit about how we can kind of make progress in that space?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:06):**  I'm reasonably confident it's going to happen only because of the very high level global  
**[0:20:14-0:20:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:14):**  pressures and initiatives now that influence the global finance system from top down that  
**[0:20:21-0:20:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:21):**  require common metrics and require common reporting systems.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:25):**  So it's in a state of rapid maturing of all of that, which is why it's confusing at the  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:32):**  moment, why it seems like that there's lots of different metrics and lots of different  
**[0:20:36-0:20:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:36):**  systems that are being talked about.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:38):**  But it will coalesce over time.  
**[0:20:41-0:20:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:41):**  It's just the way that markets work.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:43):**  How we get there more quickly and how we do it in a way that makes sense for farmers and  
**[0:20:48-0:20:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:48):**  farm businesses to participate equitably, that's the challenge.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:52):**  And that's why I'm glad that there's these industry initiatives that are trying to sort  
**[0:20:56-0:20:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:56):**  of guide that and steer that.  
**[0:20:58-0:21:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:20:58):**  Yeah, it's interesting.  
**[0:21:00-0:21:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:00):**  There's a lot of talk of it will consolidate and there will be clarity.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:04):**  But I think right now it feels super confusing whether you're a farmer looking at all these  
**[0:21:07-0:21:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:07):**  tools and industry standards.  
**[0:21:09-0:21:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:09):**  You've got beef sustainability frameworks, sector specific.  
**[0:21:12-0:21:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:12):**  You've got industry wide.  
**[0:21:13-0:21:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:13):**  You've got no, no, we need government to manage it.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:15):**  No, no, it's private sector.  
**[0:21:17-0:21:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:17):**  And then on the investor side, we get pitch decks from dozens of companies every month  
**[0:21:22-0:21:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:22):**  that are solving different pieces of this problem.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:25):**  So it feels a little bit like that's true in the future.  
**[0:21:28-0:21:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:28):**  But for anyone kind of trying to make decisions now, not feeling very true.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:32):**  I know, Rob, you've been in this space a while.  
**[0:21:34-0:21:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:34):**  Does it feel different now than it has in the past?  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:36):**  And what gives you hope that we're going to solve this problem in the near term here?  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:41):**  It feels different in that in some ways it's even more confusing because you said everyone's  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:44):**  coming up with a solution at the moment.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:46):**  You know, if I was to be blunt, when we're dealing with a lot of companies who produce  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:49):**  remote sensing data, we'll partner with a lot of them.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:52):**  A lot of them have just sort of spun out of university with an algorithm.  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:56):**  And it's a problem to then actually come back and say, well, that's a great algorithm, but  
**[0:21:58-0:21:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:58):**  it's only a small part.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:21:59):**  And actually, there's other groups doing that.  
**[0:22:02-0:22:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:02):**  And so it creates confusion in the space.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:04):**  There's no question.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:05):**  Even on simple metrics, though, even if you were just to say a metric of soil carbon sequestration  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:09):**  is difficult to do, because what's your how you're baselining that and you're assessing  
**[0:22:13-0:22:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:13):**  whether it's against a BAU or just an increase in even those metrics get really tough when  
**[0:22:18-0:22:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:18):**  you look at them, even though they start very simple, you've got exactly the same numbers,  
**[0:22:22-0:22:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:22):**  you can create different metrics from them.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:24):**  But having said that, I think there are in particular in the startup community, some  
**[0:22:28-0:22:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:28):**  really great companies coming through that have figured out how to take tech and move  
**[0:22:33-0:22:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:33):**  it to scale and move it to scale reliably.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:36):**  And Australia, interestingly, has actually been better than that than a lot of others,  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:39):**  to be frank.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:40):**  I think we've got some really big skills around the country.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:43):**  You know, you've plugged into lots of companies, be it SIBO labs with some of their fantastic  
**[0:22:48-0:22:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:48):**  stuff they're spitting out on by pasture biomass and mapping through the sort of forest stuff  
**[0:22:53-0:22:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:53):**  that we're doing and the moving into the agricultural space on the carbon.  
**[0:22:57-0:23:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:22:57):**  It's that scaling problem, I think that we're actually solving now more than the science  
**[0:23:01-0:23:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:01):**  problem.  
**[0:23:02-0:23:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:02):**  Now, some may argue there's a role for government here in creating incentives and helping scale  
**[0:23:06-0:23:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:06):**  markets.  
**[0:23:07-0:23:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:07):**  So government, you know, it's unavoidable.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:10):**  They're going to have a huge impact on practices that are accepted as reducing emissions in  
**[0:23:17-0:23:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:17):**  agriculture.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:19):**  Beyond that, you know, the international sort of government influence and policy and the  
**[0:23:24-0:23:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:24):**  way that starts to impact on ag.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:25):**  You know, obviously in Europe now we're talking about carbon border tariffs that are going  
**[0:23:30-0:23:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:30):**  to have potentially a significant impact on the requirement for things like industry sustainability  
**[0:23:37-0:23:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:37):**  frameworks and not just saying, yes, we're all great guys, we do a really good job, but  
**[0:23:42-0:23:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:42):**  actual reporting mechanisms against those frameworks that have an evidence base for  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:48):**  the carbon status of the industry so that we can continue to access those markets without  
**[0:23:54-0:23:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:54):**  incurring tariffs and so on.  
**[0:23:56-0:23:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:56):**  So government is going to have a role.  
**[0:23:58-0:23:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:58):**  It's unavoidable.  
**[0:23:59-0:24:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:23:59):**  Whether it's the right role, that's an individual philosophical thing that, you know, everyone's  
**[0:24:04-0:24:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:04):**  going to have a different opinion on that.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:07):**  Raghu, what do you think?  
**[0:24:09-0:24:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:09):**  I agree.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:10):**  I mean, there's always going to be a role of government in the policy and regulatory  
**[0:24:12-0:24:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:12):**  framework, just like any market, pretty much.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:14):**  And of course, you know, what targets governments decide to set in the future under any international  
**[0:24:18-0:24:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:18):**  agreement will then be largely setting what the potential emissions rates are and what  
**[0:24:24-0:24:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:24):**  can be traded.  
**[0:24:25-0:24:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:25):**  Decisions around whether units can move offshore or whether you can import.  
**[0:24:28-0:24:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:28):**  You know, simply they seem like simple decisions, but they have massive implications for, you  
**[0:24:32-0:24:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:32):**  know, arbitrage in price between countries and a whole lot of issues like that.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:36):**  I think the other interesting role for government that's going to be coming up is what's their  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:40):**  role in supporting the core data systems for doing this?  
**[0:24:44-0:24:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:44):**  A core data is historic weather data.  
**[0:24:47-0:24:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:47):**  A very good example.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:48):**  You know, that underpins the vast majority of these models and systems that we're all  
**[0:24:51-0:24:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:51):**  running.  
**[0:24:52-0:24:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:52):**  We need to know that those are going to keep being produced in a suitable manner.  
**[0:24:54-0:24:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:54):**  Is that an ongoing role for government?  
**[0:24:56-0:24:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:56):**  I would argue yes, but others may argue no.  
**[0:24:59-0:25:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:24:59):**  And in the US, that's a really interesting argument at the moment with NOAA, for example.  
**[0:25:02-0:25:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:02):**  Same with ongoing measurements.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:04):**  Whose job is it to create better and better models and systems and data and calibrated?  
**[0:25:09-0:25:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:09):**  And if we think back to it, the only reason that we've got most of these soil models and  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:12):**  data is from historic government funded research.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:15):**  It's not as if they've appeared overnight.  
**[0:25:17-0:25:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:17):**  It's 30 or 40 years of funding and high quality researchers working on this to deliver these  
**[0:25:22-0:25:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:22):**  systems.  
**[0:25:23-0:25:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:23):**  So I think the government is going to be heavily involved under any circumstance.  
**[0:25:27-0:25:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:27):**  It's just a matter of how do they make sure that the market itself is being pushed in  
**[0:25:31-0:25:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:31):**  the wrong way with poor policy.  
**[0:25:33-0:25:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:33):**  So we talked a little bit about how government is and can and maybe should get involved.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:37):**  You also mentioned the research sector.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:39):**  So algorithms spinning out and lots of people wanting to play in this space for really good  
**[0:25:44-0:25:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:44):**  reasons.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:45):**  What are the big research questions that still need to be answered here?  
**[0:25:48-0:25:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:48):**  Rob, I'll start with you.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:49):**  Look, I think there's still a lot of questions left and there's always improving accuracy  
**[0:25:53-0:25:54](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:53):**  in areas that we don't have.  
**[0:25:54-0:25:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:54):**  So soils, carbon is a very good one.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:25:56):**  You know, we've got reasonable tech for getting OK at soil carbon stocks.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:00):**  When you start trying to do change over shorter periods of time and doing change repeatedly,  
**[0:26:05-0:26:06](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:05):**  it's not as easy.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:06):**  And you need high quality measurements to calibrate those models as they're inherently  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:09):**  very expensive to do.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:11):**  So there are actually some really big roles there to set up those long term research trials,  
**[0:26:16-0:26:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:16):**  for example, that are very unlikely to be funded out of out of industry.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:20):**  So I think there are a number of I would argue if there was a big role, it would be setting  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:24):**  up a series of high quality sites that need ongoing measurement to actually help calibrate  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:29):**  and run the models that are needed to underpin these systems.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:32):**  It's then up to the private sector to take those data and scale them and use them in  
**[0:26:36-0:26:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:36):**  a sensible way to provide to industry.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:39):**  Richard.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:40):**  Not in an furious agreement with everything Rob's saying.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:42):**  The concept of reference sites, you know, at a granularity that enables a true understanding  
**[0:26:50-0:26:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:50):**  of baseline and relative improvement.  
**[0:26:53-0:26:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:53):**  I think that's another, you know, potentially we were talking about perverse outcomes before  
**[0:26:57-0:26:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:57):**  from outcome based payment systems.  
**[0:26:59-0:27:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:26:59):**  You know, if they're based on absolute improvement, that could be really unfair for a whole circumstance  
**[0:27:07-0:27:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:07):**  unless you've got that ability to look at relative improvement.  
**[0:27:11-0:27:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:11):**  We're going to jump in Paul.  
**[0:27:14-0:27:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:14):**  Yeah, absolutely.  
**[0:27:16-0:27:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:16):**  We haven't jumped into regulatory space yet, but if we go to an outcome, if we define an  
**[0:27:21-0:27:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:21):**  outcome before we fully understand all the data, it will lead to the wrong practice.  
**[0:27:25-0:27:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:25):**  We'll figure out ways to get to that outcome, which aren't in the true intent of what we're  
**[0:27:29-0:27:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:29):**  trying to achieve.  
**[0:27:30-0:27:37](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:30):**  So I can see the attention in this space being huge over the next five to 10 years.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:37):**  You mentioned before Rob accuracy.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:39):**  I want to come back to this point because I do think there's a bit of focus on accuracy  
**[0:27:44-0:27:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:44):**  in terms of, you know, we really need to understand exactly what is sequestered and we need better  
**[0:27:49-0:27:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:49):**  tools in tech to dig deeper cores and do that more efficiently and really understand what  
**[0:27:53-0:27:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:53):**  do you mean by accuracy isn't sort of the Holy Grail and why don't we need to focus  
**[0:27:57-0:27:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:57):**  on the accuracy?  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:27:58):**  So I'm not saying we want inaccurate data.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:00):**  I think that's a clear, clear, clear.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:02):**  I'm not saying if the answer is 42, I'm not going to throw that out there is the response.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:07):**  But I think the first thing is to actually focus on the accuracy and the measurements  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:10):**  of what we're trying to get to.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:12):**  Soil carbon again is a good example that forests are exactly the same.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:14):**  There's been so much focus on saying we need to get a stock number.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:18):**  We need to get the forest stock number, but we don't really care about that as much.  
**[0:28:21-0:28:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:21):**  Really what we need if we're doing emissions is we need change.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:23):**  That's a very, very, very different question.  
**[0:28:26-0:28:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:26):**  You have a really, really accurate stock map and another really, really accurate stock  
**[0:28:30-0:28:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:30):**  map a few years down the track and difference them and end up with a very inaccurate change  
**[0:28:33-0:28:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:33):**  map simply because the variation is huge in these landscapes.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:38):**  So the first thing is to focus on getting the accuracy and measuring what you actually  
**[0:28:42-0:28:43](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:42):**  need to measure.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:43):**  I think the other part though is there's no point in creating a really accurate map every  
**[0:28:47-0:28:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:47):**  five years, for example, if we're trying to track changes over shorter time periods.  
**[0:28:53-0:28:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:53):**  So I prefer to have less accurate maps every year.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:28:56):**  I would prefer to make sure that they're cost effective, that they're actually relevant  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:01):**  to the mitigation actions so that when you're actually taking measurements, you're actually  
**[0:29:04-0:29:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:04):**  saying the soil carbon's gone up and it's probably gone up because of this.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:13](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:08):**  So actually more researchy type plot establishments, not just stratifying an area to say how much  
**[0:29:13-0:29:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:13):**  is the carbon stock, putting research questions in place to say, why is this carbon stock  
**[0:29:17-0:29:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:17):**  different and why is it changing, for example.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:20):**  Now there's a huge number of measures that you need to consider when you're looking at  
**[0:29:24-0:29:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:24):**  doing any form of measurement and modeling and accuracy is simply one of those.  
**[0:29:29-0:29:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:29):**  It's not the one we should be focusing on 100%.  
**[0:29:33-0:29:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:33):**  Yep.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:35):**  And I think a challenge for the space as we evolve, especially as government's involved,  
**[0:29:39-0:29:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:39):**  if we think about the ERF in Australia, there's a big focus on accuracy and a big focus on  
**[0:29:44-0:29:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:44):**  specific ways of measuring, whereas we've also got voluntary markets and in setting  
**[0:29:50-0:29:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:50):**  and other ways that are evolving to create these incentives.  
**[0:29:53-0:29:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:53):**  Paul, longer term, what are you thinking about in terms of the incentives for farmers to  
**[0:29:58-0:29:59](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:58):**  do this?  
**[0:29:59-0:30:00](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:29:59):**  Is it premiums, market access?  
**[0:30:00-0:30:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:00):**  These are the things you talked about and how much are you going to care about accuracy  
**[0:30:04-0:30:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:04):**  or what actually is going to be moving the needle for you guys?  
**[0:30:07-0:30:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:07):**  In terms of direct incentives, it's a bit of a tricky one for us because we don't buy  
**[0:30:12-0:30:14](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:12):**  direct from growers, not at this stage anyway.  
**[0:30:14-0:30:17](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:14):**  So we buy through traders who are then accessed from growers.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:17):**  So there's no indication that the grain we're buying has actually gone through these farming  
**[0:30:21-0:30:22](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:21):**  systems.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:22):**  So it's a bit of an interesting one, but I think that's the way we need to be going ultimately.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:28):**  If we want true integrity in our supply chain and hand on heart, we can say that the product  
**[0:30:32-0:30:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:32):**  that we're supplying our consumers is from the lowest carbon farms in Australia, that's  
**[0:30:38-0:30:41](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:38):**  the net level we need to be going to.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:41):**  And that will create value for the growers as well.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:44):**  They know that they've got consistent supply, they've got long term relationships with Mars  
**[0:30:48-0:30:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:48):**  as well.  
**[0:30:49-0:30:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:49):**  So I think that's the space we need to get to.  
**[0:30:52-0:30:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:52):**  Initially in the short term, we just want to lower carbon.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:58](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:55):**  So we just want to put a program in place which lowers carbon and then we can work out  
**[0:30:58-0:31:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:30:58):**  getting direct credit for that later.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:01):**  We've been talking mostly about carbon, I would say.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:04):**  Does the work you're doing and the perspectives you've shared apply to other kinds of ecosystem  
**[0:31:09-0:31:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:09):**  services?  
**[0:31:10-0:31:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:10):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:31:11-0:31:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:11):**  And that's what I mean about broader, more holistic sustainability outcomes.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:20](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:16):**  Carbon is the currency that's developing more quickly than anything else.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:25](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:20):**  And even those broader objectives are getting tacked onto carbon as co-benefits, as a premium  
**[0:31:25-0:31:26](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:25):**  on the carbon price.  
**[0:31:26-0:31:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:26):**  A couple of initiatives that are going on at the moment that are working towards building  
**[0:31:30-0:31:35](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:30):**  that consistency and compatibility, the Australian Agriculture Sustainability Framework, which  
**[0:31:35-0:31:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:35):**  is a project that ourselves, the Australian Farm Institute, is involved with that is part  
**[0:31:40-0:31:45](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:40):**  of the Australian Government's Agricultural Stewardship Program.  
**[0:31:45-0:31:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:45):**  So that framework will be a set of national standards around sustainability that all other  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:51):**  industry frameworks can reference against so that we build this common brand around  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:56):**  sustainability.  
**[0:31:57-0:32:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:31:57):**  So when a particular industry or a supply chain or whoever is interested in developing  
**[0:32:02-0:32:08](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:02):**  a sustainability framework wants to talk about carbon, clean water, biodiversity, whatever  
**[0:32:08-0:32:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:08):**  the sustainability element is that they're describing, there is a set of national standards  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:12):**  that means everyone will be talking the same language and we build an Australian agriculture  
**[0:32:16-0:32:18](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:16):**  sustainability brand.  
**[0:32:18-0:32:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:18):**  And similar to that, the Natural Capital Investment Initiative, which is being led by Climaworks,  
**[0:32:23-0:32:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:23):**  and I think Sarah's group, Agthintic, is involved in that as well, is doing the same alignment  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:27):**  exercise around the way that natural capital is described and put together.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:33](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:32):**  Great.  
**[0:32:33-0:32:36](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:33):**  So I want to get one final comment from everyone before we wrap up here.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:36):**  You guys can pick which stakeholder you're talking to and offer them advice.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:44](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:40):**  So you can say, you know, if you're a farmer, if you're a researcher, if you're a startup  
**[0:32:44-0:32:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:44):**  or aspiring entrepreneur, or if you're an investor, what advice would you have for them  
**[0:32:50-0:32:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:50):**  in thinking about ecosystem services, markets and incentives?  
**[0:32:53-0:32:57](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:53):**  Rob, you're looking pensive, so I will start with you.  
**[0:32:57-0:33:02](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:32:57):**  It's because I was trying to think of who I'd attack.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:02):**  You can pick one of the one.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:10](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:05):**  Yeah, look, I'm going to I'm going to try to steal Richard's thunder here since I got  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:10):**  in first.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:11):**  Look, I think speaking of farmers, it would be exactly what you're talking about now,  
**[0:33:16-0:33:19](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:16):**  which is don't go chasing after the next big fad.  
**[0:33:19-0:33:24](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:19):**  Go just looking at your holistic farm practices and one where you can save money.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:27](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:24):**  Because a lot of the time saving money is going to save emissions.  
**[0:33:27-0:33:29](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:27):**  And secondly, look at how you're going to increase your productivity.  
**[0:33:29-0:33:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:29):**  Most of the time, that's also going to help.  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:32):**  And just keep an eye on the space.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:38](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:34):**  Don't go thinking that carbon is the be all and end all straight away for everyone.  
**[0:33:38-0:33:39](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:38):**  It's certainly a great market.  
**[0:33:39-0:33:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:39):**  It's certainly coming on.  
**[0:33:40-0:33:42](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:40):**  There's certainly huge opportunities there.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:46](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:42):**  But speaking to people like Paul, for example, that are working with farmers, I think is  
**[0:33:46-0:33:49](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:46):**  the really key part where you actually start to form these collaborative groups to figure  
**[0:33:49-0:33:51](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:49):**  out how you want to move forward next.  
**[0:33:51-0:33:52](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:51):**  Thanks, Rob.  
**[0:33:52-0:33:53](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:52):**  Paul?  
**[0:33:53-0:33:55](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:53):**  Yeah, I'll talk to the growers as well.  
**[0:33:55-0:34:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:33:55):**  So I think I've got to the last week is for the girls really educate yourself really deeply  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:01):**  understand the market that you're getting into.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:04](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:03):**  For a number of reasons.  
**[0:34:04-0:34:07](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:04):**  One, it's risk management.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:09](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:07):**  Every business needs to identify its risks and keep an eye out for it.  
**[0:34:09-0:34:12](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:09):**  But it's also a competitive advantage as well.  
**[0:34:12-0:34:16](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:12):**  And understand the leverage that you've got in this space as well.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:21](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:16):**  So if you're at the forefront of this, you can go into the industry and demand a premium  
**[0:34:21-0:34:23](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:21):**  because you're providing a premium product.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:23):**  So educate yourself, mitigate the risks, but really look for how you can leverage your  
**[0:34:28-0:34:30](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:28):**  business in this new world.  
**[0:34:30-0:34:31](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:30):**  Awesome.  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:31):**  Thanks, Paul and Richard.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:40](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:32):**  So I'm going to group bankers and politicians together, or the finance sector I should say  
**[0:34:40-0:34:47](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:40):**  rather than bankers, because both need or they try and look for simple outcomes and  
**[0:34:47-0:34:50](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:47):**  this is not going to be solved by a simple outcome.  
**[0:34:50-0:34:56](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:50):**  And that's what I really worry about, particularly with the finance sector in the way that some  
**[0:34:56-0:35:01](https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/4/6/whats-the-incentive#t=0:34:56):**  of the sector is looking at the way they assess things like natural capital, for instance,
