## 07: Seeds on film, secret sauces, woodchip composts, Care Farming plus cheeky outdoor winter salads  
**[0:00:00-0:00:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  FarmerMama7, thanks for joining us.  
**[0:00:07-0:00:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:07):**  From seeds on film to secret sources, this month we're journeying over Valleys and  
**[0:00:11-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:11):**  Vale to bring you interesting ideas and experiments in the smaller scale farming world.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:18):**  Ben's got some seed saving tips and tricks, Hala investigates care farms in her London  
**[0:00:22-0:00:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:22):**  stomping grounds, we hear the highs and lows of wood chip composts.  
**[0:00:27-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:27):**  And Abby, who's still in sunny acclimbs working with Chilean farmers, uncovers a delicious,  
**[0:00:33-0:00:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:33):**  versatile and enterprising, but little known secret sauce.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:40):**  Can we just clarify, you called it bear juice, okay, just to be clear, is it from bears?  
**[0:00:47-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:47):**  Well, we'll find out later.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:07):**  The art of seed saving is a great skill to have, but it's not always that easy to know  
**[0:01:11-0:01:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:11):**  exactly how to do it.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:13):**  Ben Raskin has been very excited by a series of short films about seeds in the life cycles  
**[0:01:18-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:18):**  of vegetables.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:20):**  32 kinds.  
**[0:01:22-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:22):**  The films explain all about the harvesting, extracting, sorting and storing of seeds.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:28):**  And here he is talking to Nick Bell, one of the team that made them.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:32):**  We are all part of an agricultural, a movement of agricultural collectives, I suppose you  
**[0:01:38-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:38):**  could call it, which exists in five different countries in Europe, which is called Langomai.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:44):**  We are in the south of France and have a large garden and have produced our own seeds for  
**[0:01:50-0:01:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:50):**  many years.  
**[0:01:53-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:53):**  But we have begun to realize more and more that the know-how about how to make seeds  
**[0:02:00-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:00):**  is disappearing fast, particularly of open pollinated heirloom varieties of vegetables  
**[0:02:05-0:02:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:05):**  and so on.  
**[0:02:06-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:06):**  We are also very much involved in a European-wide campaign against increasingly restrictive  
**[0:02:12-0:02:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:12):**  European legislation or national legislation on the seed question and of course against  
**[0:02:18-0:02:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:18):**  the increasing domination of a few large multinationals.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:24):**  And we see the making of seeds, producing of seeds by a maximum amount of people as  
**[0:02:32-0:02:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:32):**  probably the best way to react to that kind of increasing monopoly.  
**[0:02:38-0:02:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:38):**  In England we perhaps think of France as being still more connected to that rural skill and  
**[0:02:45-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:45):**  rural know-how than perhaps we are.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:48):**  Is that not the case?  
**[0:02:50-0:02:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:50):**  You certainly have a greater attachment maybe to small farmers, the paysans, the confération  
**[0:02:57-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:57):**  paysanne and all this.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:58):**  You also have a movement of I would say more sometimes urban people or also rural people  
**[0:03:06-0:03:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:06):**  but more amateurs who are doing a lot of their own vegetables and seed production.  
**[0:03:11-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:11):**  It is as you probably know officially illegal to sell varieties which have not been registered  
**[0:03:19-0:03:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:19):**  in the official catalog.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:21):**  When you make your own seeds in your vegetable plot you always have far too many seeds, much  
**[0:03:27-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:27):**  more than you need yourself.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:29):**  So we organise these seed swaps and in fact you quite quickly realise that a lot of people  
**[0:03:34-0:03:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:34):**  do not really necessarily have the knowledge to produce seeds or make seeds but they won't  
**[0:03:40-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:40):**  necessarily be pure.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:41):**  I mean there would be a lot of cross-pollination and so on.  
**[0:03:45-0:03:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  So we started having training programmes and then we began to more and more think that  
**[0:03:51-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:51):**  being able to visually see what seed saving means would be really, really useful and we  
**[0:03:59-0:04:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:59):**  realised that nobody had really done it.  
**[0:04:01-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:01):**  As well as that technical showing how to do it, it is also about inspiring and about making  
**[0:04:08-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:08):**  people want to and think that they can and believe that they can.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:12):**  Yes, because I think a lot of people somehow think that producing your own seeds is really,  
**[0:04:17-0:04:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:17):**  professionals have to do that.  
**[0:04:19-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:19):**  It is far too complicated and they just don't think they can do it.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:23):**  So really we want to show that it is absolutely possible to do it.  
**[0:04:27-0:04:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:27):**  It is not even that difficult and it is real pleasure actually.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:30):**  I mean it is just fantastic to make your own seeds and then plant them and get these amazing  
**[0:04:34-0:04:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:34):**  vegetables from them and continue actually also selecting the plants that you are particularly  
**[0:04:40-0:04:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:40):**  interested in and so on.  
**[0:04:41-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:41):**  I mean it is a very creative process and it is really possible.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:45):**  Nick Bell there with our own Ben Raskin.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:47):**  Nigel, do you save your seeds?  
**[0:04:50-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:50):**  No, not currently Joe.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:53):**  Why not?  
**[0:04:54-0:04:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:54):**  My dad does all the sort of arable side of things.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:57):**  I am more on the livestock but no I am planning to, I really want to grow some sort of heritage  
**[0:05:04-0:05:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:04):**  wheat so it is something that I will definitely be doing soon hopefully.  
**[0:05:08-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:08):**  Great and you can learn all about how to do it by buying the DVD set which you can get  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:15):**  at seedfilm.org so make sure you check that out.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:18):**  I definitely will.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:43):**  Health and farming naturally go hand in hand and last month we heard about plans for a  
**[0:05:48-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:48):**  CSA in the grounds of a hospital and this month Hannah chatted to Rachel Bragg.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:54):**  She is Development Coordinator at Care Farm UK and they provide support services for care  
**[0:05:59-0:06:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:59):**  farming and they also lobby to raise awareness of this approach.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:03):**  I mean I think care farming is something that some farmers have been doing for years and  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:08):**  years and years and not really ever called it care farming and I think in the last ten  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:12):**  years they have all sort of banded together under the care farming banner if you like.  
**[0:06:18-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:18):**  Other farms are starting off by thinking we would quite like to help some people in the  
**[0:06:23-0:06:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:23):**  local community so they have started doing farm visits or things like that and they have  
**[0:06:29-0:06:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:29):**  started dipping a toe in the water if you like and then they sort of moved on to develop  
**[0:06:35-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:35):**  actual programmes with structured facilitated activities for people who are not so fortunate  
**[0:06:40-0:06:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:40):**  in society or people that are recovering from drug and alcohol addiction or children on  
**[0:06:49-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:49):**  the autistic spectrum.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:52):**  All sorts of different client groups essentially can benefit from spending time outside in  
**[0:06:57-0:06:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:57):**  nature.  
**[0:06:58-0:07:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:58):**  I think you are right actually.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:01):**  Agriculture in the past would have kind of roles for so many different people and I remember  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:05):**  on our farm where I grew up it started off with like a team of ten men and then people  
**[0:07:10-0:07:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:10):**  from the community coming in to do paid jobs in picking in the summer and then things changed  
**[0:07:15-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:15):**  in like ten years and suddenly it was two men and a combine harvester doing the whole  
**[0:07:19-0:07:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:19):**  harvest in two weeks.  
**[0:07:21-0:07:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:21):**  So yeah a lot of people have lost sight of the benefits of that kind of physical work  
**[0:07:28-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:28):**  and obviously the physicality and the mental well-being have really really really joined  
**[0:07:33-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:33):**  up and perhaps we are coming to realise that again.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:37):**  Absolutely I think it's now people are starting to realise or to re-remember if you like the  
**[0:07:44-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:44):**  benefits of being outside in nature.  
**[0:07:46-0:07:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:46):**  I mean at the moment we are seeing a bit of a sort of a surgence really of what we call  
**[0:07:50-0:07:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:50):**  green care which is various different ways of using nature for health and well-being.  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:56):**  So you know it could be social and therapeutic horticulture or some environmental conservation  
**[0:08:01-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:01):**  programmes as an intervention, care farming of course there are all sorts of different  
**[0:08:08-0:08:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:08):**  types of activity you can do under the banner of green care.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:12):**  And I think the changing in agriculture is also it's forced especially smaller farmers  
**[0:08:18-0:08:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:18):**  or smaller farms, smaller farmers to sort of really think about how they can or having  
**[0:08:25-0:08:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:25):**  to think about all sorts of different ways of making their farm viable and doing sort  
**[0:08:30-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:30):**  of all sorts of different activities and having people on your farm and being able to set  
**[0:08:35-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:35):**  up a sort of care farming programme can offer another way of sort of keeping the farm viable  
**[0:08:42-0:08:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:42):**  as well.  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:43):**  I mean I always say that if farmers are interested in doing care farming it's usually most of  
**[0:08:48-0:08:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:48):**  them have started, their initial driver has been some sort of altruistic reason you know  
**[0:08:53-0:09:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:53):**  wanting to sort of help people and then obviously it's good for people, it's good for farming  
**[0:09:00-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:00):**  you know.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:01):**  The thing about care farming that makes it so different from having a B&B on your farm  
**[0:09:06-0:09:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:06):**  or something is that you're using the farming that you're doing to help people and to bring  
**[0:09:11-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:11):**  in another income stream as well.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:13):**  We say that the, and the research shows actually as well, that it's this mix of three things  
**[0:09:19-0:09:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:19):**  so it's the activities, the meaningful activities that people are doing and the skills that  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:25):**  they're learning in doing those, it's the farm surrounding so it's the sort of the nature  
**[0:09:32-0:09:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:32):**  side of it and it's also the people.  
**[0:09:34-0:09:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:34):**  When you come onto a farm you become part of a team and that's what people love and  
**[0:09:40-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:40):**  it's sort of about working together and it can have an amazing effect and a change on  
**[0:09:44-0:09:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:44):**  people's lives.  
**[0:09:45-0:09:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:45):**  I do really like that aspect with like a farm that's actually commercially producing food  
**[0:09:50-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:50):**  or working with livestock, it's not tokenistic work, it's work that really needs to be done  
**[0:09:56-0:10:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:56):**  and actually as a volunteer or if you're part of a traineeship or a programme to be doing  
**[0:10:01-0:10:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:01):**  something that needs to be done, that's like, it feels good I think.  
**[0:10:05-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:05):**  I feel like people are trying to connect now with clinical commissioning and you know,  
**[0:10:10-0:10:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:10):**  health directors to say actually this is a way of potentially saving you money and a  
**[0:10:17-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:17):**  better way to go about things.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:19):**  And I don't know it would be interesting to talk about the money side of things a little  
**[0:10:23-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:23):**  bit if possible but I've seen some reports that are showing you know, what would be paid  
**[0:10:29-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:29):**  in NHS services in medication and then potentially people being out of work is actually, it's  
**[0:10:38-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:38):**  high and if you're putting someone into a programme there are chances that they will  
**[0:10:42-0:10:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:42):**  need to be less dependent on these services.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:46):**  One of the main drivers in health and social care at the moment is, well obviously we've  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:50):**  had all the changes, we've got all the clinical commissioning groups in place now which are  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:54):**  theoretically supposed to deal with the health and the social care commissioning but also  
**[0:11:01-0:11:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:01):**  the real driver is for integrated health and social care and that's perfect, that's what  
**[0:11:07-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:07):**  happens on a care farm, it's integrated health and social care and yes it's very exciting  
**[0:11:12-0:11:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:12):**  potentially because it's an enjoyable option, it's one that people will, you know the adherence  
**[0:11:18-0:11:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:18):**  rates are quite high and people go back to it because they enjoy it and it doesn't feel  
**[0:11:23-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:23):**  like a clinical intervention and you also have other people who get as part of their  
**[0:11:29-0:11:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:29):**  commissioning they're on personal, what we call personal budgets where they get the money  
**[0:11:32-0:11:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:32):**  that they're going to spend on their health or their social care and they are allowed  
**[0:11:37-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:37):**  to choose where they spend it and they usually work with their carer or families to decide  
**[0:11:42-0:11:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:42):**  where they want to be cared for if you like and a lot of them decide that they want to  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:48):**  come to a farm and they can choose themselves what they want to do.  
**[0:11:52-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:52):**  Typically farmers get paid about £50 per session per client, again people who need  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:00):**  more care the costs might go up, they do vary but it's about £50 for a session, most care  
**[0:12:06-0:12:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:06):**  farms the session is a day and by a day I mean something like 10 till 3.30, 4 o'clock,  
**[0:12:12-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:12):**  something like that and so in terms of being cost effective as well you know it's not a  
**[0:12:19-0:12:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:19):**  really really expensive option but it's something that can as you say lead into people developing  
**[0:12:26-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:26):**  skills developing a sort of a work ethic sometimes as well and sometimes people who've been  
**[0:12:32-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:32):**  cared for all their lives you know being able to care for something else themselves is a  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:37):**  completely new experience and you know it's great.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:41):**  We're not suggesting that every farm becomes a care farm because some farmers don't want  
**[0:12:45-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:45):**  to do it, some farms it's just simply not appropriate but I think it's one of those  
**[0:12:52-0:12:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:52):**  things that farmers should be aware that through farming and the use of agricultural landscapes  
**[0:12:58-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:58):**  that thousands of people are feeling better, care farms I think we've worked out about  
**[0:13:03-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:03):**  seven or eight thousand people per week go for care farming services.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:11):**  Mainstream farming can do well really to remember that there are other farmers that are offering  
**[0:13:16-0:13:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:16):**  this service really putting something back into society, farming gets bad press a lot  
**[0:13:21-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:21):**  of the time there's always something and I think we should be, this is another thing  
**[0:13:26-0:13:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:26):**  we should be shouting about from the rooftops to say look this is what farming is doing,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:31):**  farming not you know we don't just look after the landscape and provide rural jobs, grow  
**[0:13:37-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:37):**  delicious food but we're also helping people you know we provide our farmed landscape,  
**[0:13:44-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:44):**  provide areas for leisure and recreation loads of people go walking across farmland, we're  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:49):**  providing all of these services and health and well-being services through care farming  
**[0:13:54-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:54):**  is yet another one of the uses of farming really and I think we can we do well to remember  
**[0:14:00-0:14:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:00):**  that.  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:01):**  Hannah Schlotter speaking to Rachel Bragg.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:04):**  I think care farming is really exciting and it obviously brings joy to a lot of people's  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:08):**  lives but I can understand that some farmers may see it as just a little odd, it could  
**[0:14:15-0:14:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:15):**  sound a bit like farming people when you consider care farming to be your farm's main income  
**[0:14:21-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:21):**  but as Hannah pointed out in a way this service is just another form of health and well-being  
**[0:14:28-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:28):**  support essentially farmers can see themselves as providing health services and in truth  
**[0:14:34-0:14:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:34):**  this framing works quite well because essentially that is what people who grow our food are  
**[0:14:39-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:39):**  anyways this may be a long shot but if we think about how much we pay for our health  
**[0:14:45-0:14:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:45):**  services then this could be quite a beneficial shift in perspective that meant people would  
**[0:14:51-0:15:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:51):**  be willing to pay more for farming services.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:11):**  One farmer who's inspired many in the UK organics world is Ian Tolhurst.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:18):**  His farm played host to one of the initial innovative farmers experiments about the uses  
**[0:15:22-0:15:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:22):**  of wood chip compost and we talked to him about this and asked him what it's all about  
**[0:15:26-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:26):**  starting with what's it used for?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:29):**  Primarily for supporting fertility in horticultural system it's fed to the soil so it's a soil  
**[0:15:36-0:15:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:36):**  feeder it's to improve soil quality, soil texture, there's a little bit of nutrient  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:42):**  available but we're not really looking at nutrients really more about adding organic  
**[0:15:46-0:15:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:46):**  matter to soil and particularly important is adding a range a whole diverse range of  
**[0:15:52-0:15:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:52):**  biological activity particularly soil fauna and fungi which soil responds to very positively.  
**[0:15:58-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:58):**  It's a process which takes about a year or a year and a quarter it doesn't rely on any  
**[0:16:02-0:16:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:02):**  external inputs at all it's run primarily on the sugars and proteins of fresh wood chip  
**[0:16:08-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:08):**  this is trees that have been chipped up mostly going to waste and the process is dependent  
**[0:16:14-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:14):**  primarily on wood fungi and bacterial action so there's no inputs from outside and the  
**[0:16:21-0:16:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:21):**  end result is a product which can be spread very safely onto farmland it can be used in  
**[0:16:26-0:16:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:26):**  horticulture and it can be used for making a range of propagation compost.  
**[0:16:32-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:32):**  The temperature remains quite constant so it doesn't go very very hot and then rapidly  
**[0:16:37-0:16:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:37):**  cool because what happens in a normal compost where you have a large amount of green material  
**[0:16:42-0:16:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:42):**  is that you get very rapid heating up and then because it becomes so hot it kills all  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:46):**  the micrology so the microbiology tends to die off because of high heat temperatures.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:52):**  In the wood chip system you don't get the same effect you get quite high temperature  
**[0:16:55-0:17:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:55):**  rise but you get a very low temperature gradient going down I'm not sure why that is but it's  
**[0:17:02-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:02):**  more because we're dependent on soil fungi rather than nitrogen to rot the material down.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:08):**  Nitrogen is the driver in conventional compost making you need lots of nitrogen to rot down  
**[0:17:13-0:17:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:13):**  the carbon.  
**[0:17:14-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:14):**  In a wood chip system you're not relying on nitrogen at all because there's none effectively  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:19):**  it's carbon and carbon only there's almost no nitrogen so you're relying on wood fungi  
**[0:17:24-0:17:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:24):**  and soil bacteria which behave in a completely different way.  
**[0:17:28-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:28):**  It can be done on virtually any scale so the minimum size really would be around 5 cubic  
**[0:17:33-0:17:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:33):**  meters and there is no upper maximum size other than the constraints of your site.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:39):**  And what about getting wood chip because I know you said you get it from a local tree  
**[0:17:43-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:43):**  specialist and I know wood chippers are really really expensive.  
**[0:17:46-0:17:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:46):**  A lot of tree surgeons have to pay quite a large amount of money to take their material  
**[0:17:51-0:17:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:51):**  to either composting sites, municipal composting sites or to landfill sites so they have to  
**[0:17:57-0:18:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:57):**  pay a fee to deposit so they're looking for places where maybe not such a high fee or  
**[0:18:04-0:18:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:04):**  no fee at all and places which are very local to them.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:08):**  Because they're generally going to municipal composting sites they often have to travel  
**[0:18:12-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:12):**  quite a long way and for them that's usually the problem more than the actual cost it's  
**[0:18:16-0:18:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:16):**  the travel so it's time so they're looking for somewhere which is on their way home on  
**[0:18:21-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:21):**  a daily basis we receive material almost daily during the winter.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:26):**  So it's convenient to them, convenience is really more important than the cost of leaving  
**[0:18:30-0:18:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:30):**  the material behind.  
**[0:18:31-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:31):**  And can you talk a little bit about your experiment growing things on top of the compost heap?  
**[0:18:36-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:36):**  Yeah that was kind of an off the cuff experiment really to try and see if we could maximize  
**[0:18:42-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:42):**  some of the heat that was coming from the compost during the winter because it gives  
**[0:18:45-0:18:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:45):**  off enormous amounts of heat.  
**[0:18:46-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:46):**  So during a very cold winter 2012 it was we did some trials with growing some sallys in  
**[0:18:53-0:18:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:53):**  December which you wouldn't normally do on top of the compost heap outside with nothing  
**[0:18:58-0:19:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:58):**  more than a very thin plastic cover to keep the snow off and we had some really interesting  
**[0:19:02-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:02):**  results in that we were able to grow right away through the winter with no supplementary  
**[0:19:07-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:07):**  inputs whatsoever using wood chip compost as a growing medium in modules and taking  
**[0:19:14-0:19:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:14):**  the heat from the residual heat from the heap itself in order to keep the plants growing  
**[0:19:19-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:19):**  with the higher increased temperature is very successful.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:22):**  The only difficulty is in this climate is providing enough light because things will  
**[0:19:26-0:19:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:26):**  grow with the heat but they get quite leggy but we did successfully manage to grow some  
**[0:19:31-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:31):**  quite good solid crops at the time of year which we wouldn't normally be doing it.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:36):**  It's interesting to learn about the different types of compost and chatting more with Ian  
**[0:19:40-0:19:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:40):**  we realised how little was understood about why the compost behaved as it did or about  
**[0:19:46-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:46):**  the different fungi and microbiology working away.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:50):**  We also love the idea of using the compost residual heat for other purposes like growing  
**[0:19:55-0:20:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:55):**  salad in winter.  
**[0:20:03-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:03):**  And now last but not least the secret sauce.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:07):**  Abby's family farm olives, vines, orchards and vegetable gardens organically in Chile.  
**[0:20:15-0:20:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:15):**  Everything's dry farmed except the veg so whilst the olives continue to grow slowly  
**[0:20:20-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:20):**  they started making natural wine from the very old vines on the land and then this happened.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:27):**  Bear juice did I hear that right?  
**[0:20:30-0:20:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:30):**  No, bear juice is a French term meaning green juice and in fact agras is the Spanish term  
**[0:20:42-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:42):**  of well the Spanish term meaning a bitter juice or bitter and here in Chile we call  
**[0:20:53-0:20:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:53):**  it agras.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:55):**  Okay so it's bear juice and just because you're speaking with a Spanish accent you say bear  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:01):**  juice.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:04):**  Si.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:08):**  One day I happened to be listening to a BBC food and farming podcast and they were talking  
**[0:21:17-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:17):**  about bear juice, bear juice being a juice that's harvested or made from grapes or crab  
**[0:21:30-0:21:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:30):**  apples or some sort of juice.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:36):**  That sounded really interesting it sounded like something we could give it make so we  
**[0:21:41-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:41):**  set out to have a go.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:46):**  One of the unique things about it is it comes from the time in the harvest or well before  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:55):**  the harvest early in the season when we're thinning the grapes.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:59):**  So normally those grapes would just be dropped on the ground and not used.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  So we took these grapes and produces agras.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:22:12):**  This very bitter, very sharp juice that has many many possibilities.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:22:27):**  We use it for salad dressings, we use it for tall drinks or cocktails or in cooking where  
**[0:22:36-0:22:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:22:36):**  you would use lemon juice or vinegar is commonly used and it's just a more subtle gentler acidity  
**[0:22:47-0:22:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:22:47):**  and doesn't overpower or dominate flavors.  
**[0:22:52-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:22:52):**  It allows the flavors to be brightened and sharpened without dominating them.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:00):**  There's a beetroot salad I particularly love that the agras really enhances.  
**[0:23:10-0:23:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:10):**  You use it as you would vinegar so it's not overpowering.  
**[0:23:16-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:16):**  So the same ratio, actually you can use a little bit more agras than you would vinegar  
**[0:23:20-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:20):**  or lemon juice because it is more subtle.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:23):**  It's a wine friendly condiment.  
**[0:23:27-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:27):**  That means if you're having a wine with the meal you don't want it to be overpowered with  
**[0:23:34-0:23:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:34):**  the acidity of lemon juice or the acidity of vinegars and agras is the perfect solution.  
**[0:23:44-0:23:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:44):**  We thin the grapes in order to focus the energy on the grapes that we want to make wine with.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:54):**  So by eliminating some of the grapes the energy of the plant or the vines goes into the grapes  
**[0:24:02-0:24:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:02):**  that are left and the ones that are removed are obviously removed.  
**[0:24:10-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:10):**  And so normally they're a byproduct or a waste product but you're actually using them to  
**[0:24:17-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:17):**  make a different type of juice, is that right?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:20):**  That's correct and that grape juice is very, very bitter, very green and quite firm and  
**[0:24:32-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:32):**  in the firmness it's one of the issues is how much juice is in those grapes early in  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:39):**  the season.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:41):**  So it's a little bit of a balance as to when to do that.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:45):**  But anyway we've gained some experience finding out when is the best time and now our agras  
**[0:24:53-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:53):**  is maturing in its both consistency but also quality.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:03):**  If someone else wanted to make agras kind of what do you think are the main learnings  
**[0:25:06-0:25:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:06):**  or what are the main things to think about?  
**[0:25:10-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:10):**  One of the things is what we were just talking about, the timing.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:15):**  Because if you wait too late the fermentation, the grape, the juice could possibly ferment.  
**[0:25:24-0:25:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:24):**  So I think very important is finding the right time to do it.  
**[0:25:29-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:29):**  Any tips for the actual making of it?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:31):**  Because I know that some people for example would just, in a similar way to wine, they  
**[0:25:37-0:25:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:37):**  put sulfates in at the end of the process to prevent fermentation.  
**[0:25:41-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:41):**  Are you doing that?  
**[0:25:43-0:25:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:43):**  No.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:44):**  We simply do what we would consider a very natural process of harvesting the grape, crushing  
**[0:25:54-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:54):**  the grape, pressing it, getting the juice and then simply taking that juice and bottling  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:03):**  it.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:07):**  You can and it may be necessary also to pasteurize some of it depending on what you're doing  
**[0:26:13-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:13):**  with it or where you're sending it or who wants it.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:20):**  It is amazing and surprisingly it's really nice on a fruit salad or with fresh fruit,  
**[0:26:30-0:26:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:30):**  chilled with a little bit of agras.  
**[0:26:35-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:35):**  Lovely.  
**[0:26:39-0:26:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:39):**  For me, basically the most exciting thing is that it's very simple to produce in many  
**[0:26:47-0:26:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:47):**  ways and yet it has real unique quality.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:57):**  It brings this kind of not just freshness but sharpness to a range of different foods  
**[0:27:05-0:27:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:27:05):**  and drinks that is just special.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:27:13):**  That was Tom and Christine or mum and dad as they're known to Abby talking about this  
**[0:27:18-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:27:18):**  very special condiment, verjuice or agras, the ultimate secret ingredient.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:27:27):**  It's really not that easy to find verjuice or agras in the UK but you can go to our website
