**[0:00:00-0:00:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  FarmerMama7, thanks for joining us.  From seeds on film to secret sources, this month we're journeying over Valleys and  Vale to bring you interesting ideas and experiments in the smaller scale farming world.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:18):**  Ben's got some seed saving tips and tricks, Hala investigates care farms in her London  stomping grounds, we hear the highs and lows of wood chip composts.  And Abby, who's still in sunny acclimbs working with Chilean farmers, uncovers a delicious,  
**[0:00:33-0:01:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:00:33):**  versatile and enterprising, but little known secret sauce.  Can we just clarify, you called it bear juice, okay, just to be clear, is it from bears?  Well, we'll find out later.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:07):**  The art of seed saving is a great skill to have, but it's not always that easy to know  exactly how to do it.  Ben Raskin has been very excited by a series of short films about seeds in the life cycles  
**[0:01:18-0:01:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:18):**  of vegetables.  32 kinds.  The films explain all about the harvesting, extracting, sorting and storing of seeds.  
**[0:01:28-0:01:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:28):**  And here he is talking to Nick Bell, one of the team that made them.  We are all part of an agricultural, a movement of agricultural collectives, I suppose you  could call it, which exists in five different countries in Europe, which is called Langomai.  
**[0:01:44-0:02:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:01:44):**  We are in the south of France and have a large garden and have produced our own seeds for  many years.  But we have begun to realize more and more that the know-how about how to make seeds  
**[0:02:00-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:00):**  is disappearing fast, particularly of open pollinated heirloom varieties of vegetables  and so on.  We are also very much involved in a European-wide campaign against increasingly restrictive  
**[0:02:12-0:02:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:12):**  European legislation or national legislation on the seed question and of course against  the increasing domination of a few large multinationals.  And we see the making of seeds, producing of seeds by a maximum amount of people as  
**[0:02:32-0:02:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:32):**  probably the best way to react to that kind of increasing monopoly.  In England we perhaps think of France as being still more connected to that rural skill and  rural know-how than perhaps we are.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:48):**  Is that not the case?  You certainly have a greater attachment maybe to small farmers, the paysans, the confération  paysanne and all this.  
**[0:02:58-0:03:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:02:58):**  You also have a movement of I would say more sometimes urban people or also rural people  but more amateurs who are doing a lot of their own vegetables and seed production.  It is as you probably know officially illegal to sell varieties which have not been registered  
**[0:03:19-0:03:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:19):**  in the official catalog.  When you make your own seeds in your vegetable plot you always have far too many seeds, much  more than you need yourself.  
**[0:03:29-0:03:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:29):**  So we organise these seed swaps and in fact you quite quickly realise that a lot of people  do not really necessarily have the knowledge to produce seeds or make seeds but they won't  necessarily be pure.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:41):**  I mean there would be a lot of cross-pollination and so on.  So we started having training programmes and then we began to more and more think that  being able to visually see what seed saving means would be really, really useful and we  
**[0:03:59-0:04:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:03:59):**  realised that nobody had really done it.  As well as that technical showing how to do it, it is also about inspiring and about making  people want to and think that they can and believe that they can.  
**[0:04:12-0:04:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:12):**  Yes, because I think a lot of people somehow think that producing your own seeds is really,  professionals have to do that.  It is far too complicated and they just don't think they can do it.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:23):**  So really we want to show that it is absolutely possible to do it.  It is not even that difficult and it is real pleasure actually.  I mean it is just fantastic to make your own seeds and then plant them and get these amazing  
**[0:04:34-0:04:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:34):**  vegetables from them and continue actually also selecting the plants that you are particularly  interested in and so on.  I mean it is a very creative process and it is really possible.  
**[0:04:45-0:04:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:45):**  Nick Bell there with our own Ben Raskin.  Nigel, do you save your seeds?  No, not currently Joe.  
**[0:04:53-0:05:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:04:53):**  Why not?  My dad does all the sort of arable side of things.  I am more on the livestock but no I am planning to, I really want to grow some sort of heritage  
**[0:05:04-0:05:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:04):**  wheat so it is something that I will definitely be doing soon hopefully.  Great and you can learn all about how to do it by buying the DVD set which you can get  at seedfilm.org so make sure you check that out.  
**[0:05:18-0:05:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:18):**  I definitely will.  Health and farming naturally go hand in hand and last month we heard about plans for a  CSA in the grounds of a hospital and this month Hannah chatted to Rachel Bragg.  
**[0:05:54-0:06:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:05:54):**  She is Development Coordinator at Care Farm UK and they provide support services for care  farming and they also lobby to raise awareness of this approach.  I mean I think care farming is something that some farmers have been doing for years and  
**[0:06:08-0:06:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:08):**  years and years and not really ever called it care farming and I think in the last ten  years they have all sort of banded together under the care farming banner if you like.  Other farms are starting off by thinking we would quite like to help some people in the  
**[0:06:23-0:06:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:23):**  local community so they have started doing farm visits or things like that and they have  started dipping a toe in the water if you like and then they sort of moved on to develop  actual programmes with structured facilitated activities for people who are not so fortunate  
**[0:06:40-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:40):**  in society or people that are recovering from drug and alcohol addiction or children on  the autistic spectrum.  All sorts of different client groups essentially can benefit from spending time outside in  
**[0:06:57-0:07:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:06:57):**  nature.  I think you are right actually.  Agriculture in the past would have kind of roles for so many different people and I remember  
**[0:07:05-0:07:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:05):**  on our farm where I grew up it started off with like a team of ten men and then people  from the community coming in to do paid jobs in picking in the summer and then things changed  in like ten years and suddenly it was two men and a combine harvester doing the whole  
**[0:07:19-0:07:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:19):**  harvest in two weeks.  So yeah a lot of people have lost sight of the benefits of that kind of physical work  and obviously the physicality and the mental well-being have really really really joined  
**[0:07:33-0:07:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:33):**  up and perhaps we are coming to realise that again.  Absolutely I think it's now people are starting to realise or to re-remember if you like the  benefits of being outside in nature.  
**[0:07:46-0:08:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:07:46):**  I mean at the moment we are seeing a bit of a sort of a surgence really of what we call  green care which is various different ways of using nature for health and well-being.  So you know it could be social and therapeutic horticulture or some environmental conservation  
**[0:08:01-0:08:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:01):**  programmes as an intervention, care farming of course there are all sorts of different  types of activity you can do under the banner of green care.  And I think the changing in agriculture is also it's forced especially smaller farmers  
**[0:08:18-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:18):**  or smaller farms, smaller farmers to sort of really think about how they can or having  to think about all sorts of different ways of making their farm viable and doing sort  of all sorts of different activities and having people on your farm and being able to set  
**[0:08:35-0:08:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:35):**  up a sort of care farming programme can offer another way of sort of keeping the farm viable  as well.  I mean I always say that if farmers are interested in doing care farming it's usually most of  
**[0:08:48-0:09:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:08:48):**  them have started, their initial driver has been some sort of altruistic reason you know  wanting to sort of help people and then obviously it's good for people, it's good for farming  you know.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:01):**  The thing about care farming that makes it so different from having a B&B on your farm  or something is that you're using the farming that you're doing to help people and to bring  in another income stream as well.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:13):**  We say that the, and the research shows actually as well, that it's this mix of three things  so it's the activities, the meaningful activities that people are doing and the skills that  they're learning in doing those, it's the farm surrounding so it's the sort of the nature  
**[0:09:32-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:32):**  side of it and it's also the people.  When you come onto a farm you become part of a team and that's what people love and  it's sort of about working together and it can have an amazing effect and a change on  
**[0:09:44-0:09:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:44):**  people's lives.  I do really like that aspect with like a farm that's actually commercially producing food  or working with livestock, it's not tokenistic work, it's work that really needs to be done  
**[0:09:56-0:10:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:09:56):**  and actually as a volunteer or if you're part of a traineeship or a programme to be doing  something that needs to be done, that's like, it feels good I think.  I feel like people are trying to connect now with clinical commissioning and you know,  
**[0:10:10-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:10):**  health directors to say actually this is a way of potentially saving you money and a  better way to go about things.  And I don't know it would be interesting to talk about the money side of things a little  
**[0:10:23-0:10:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:23):**  bit if possible but I've seen some reports that are showing you know, what would be paid  in NHS services in medication and then potentially people being out of work is actually, it's  high and if you're putting someone into a programme there are chances that they will  
**[0:10:42-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:42):**  need to be less dependent on these services.  One of the main drivers in health and social care at the moment is, well obviously we've  had all the changes, we've got all the clinical commissioning groups in place now which are  
**[0:10:54-0:11:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:10:54):**  theoretically supposed to deal with the health and the social care commissioning but also  the real driver is for integrated health and social care and that's perfect, that's what  happens on a care farm, it's integrated health and social care and yes it's very exciting  
**[0:11:12-0:11:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:12):**  potentially because it's an enjoyable option, it's one that people will, you know the adherence  rates are quite high and people go back to it because they enjoy it and it doesn't feel  like a clinical intervention and you also have other people who get as part of their  
**[0:11:29-0:11:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:29):**  commissioning they're on personal, what we call personal budgets where they get the money  that they're going to spend on their health or their social care and they are allowed  to choose where they spend it and they usually work with their carer or families to decide  
**[0:11:42-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:11:42):**  where they want to be cared for if you like and a lot of them decide that they want to  come to a farm and they can choose themselves what they want to do.  Typically farmers get paid about £50 per session per client, again people who need  
**[0:12:00-0:12:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:00):**  more care the costs might go up, they do vary but it's about £50 for a session, most care  farms the session is a day and by a day I mean something like 10 till 3.30, 4 o'clock,  something like that and so in terms of being cost effective as well you know it's not a  
**[0:12:19-0:12:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:19):**  really really expensive option but it's something that can as you say lead into people developing  skills developing a sort of a work ethic sometimes as well and sometimes people who've been  cared for all their lives you know being able to care for something else themselves is a  
**[0:12:37-0:12:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:37):**  completely new experience and you know it's great.  We're not suggesting that every farm becomes a care farm because some farmers don't want  to do it, some farms it's just simply not appropriate but I think it's one of those  
**[0:12:52-0:13:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:12:52):**  things that farmers should be aware that through farming and the use of agricultural landscapes  that thousands of people are feeling better, care farms I think we've worked out about  seven or eight thousand people per week go for care farming services.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:11):**  Mainstream farming can do well really to remember that there are other farmers that are offering  this service really putting something back into society, farming gets bad press a lot  of the time there's always something and I think we should be, this is another thing  
**[0:13:26-0:13:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:26):**  we should be shouting about from the rooftops to say look this is what farming is doing,  farming not you know we don't just look after the landscape and provide rural jobs, grow  delicious food but we're also helping people you know we provide our farmed landscape,  
**[0:13:44-0:14:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:13:44):**  provide areas for leisure and recreation loads of people go walking across farmland, we're  providing all of these services and health and well-being services through care farming  is yet another one of the uses of farming really and I think we can we do well to remember  
**[0:14:00-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:00):**  that.  Hannah Schlotter speaking to Rachel Bragg.  I think care farming is really exciting and it obviously brings joy to a lot of people's  
**[0:14:08-0:14:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:08):**  lives but I can understand that some farmers may see it as just a little odd, it could  sound a bit like farming people when you consider care farming to be your farm's main income  but as Hannah pointed out in a way this service is just another form of health and well-being  
**[0:14:28-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:28):**  support essentially farmers can see themselves as providing health services and in truth  this framing works quite well because essentially that is what people who grow our food are  anyways this may be a long shot but if we think about how much we pay for our health  
**[0:14:45-0:15:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:14:45):**  services then this could be quite a beneficial shift in perspective that meant people would  be willing to pay more for farming services.  One farmer who's inspired many in the UK organics world is Ian Tolhurst.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:18):**  His farm played host to one of the initial innovative farmers experiments about the uses  of wood chip compost and we talked to him about this and asked him what it's all about  starting with what's it used for?  
**[0:15:29-0:15:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:29):**  Primarily for supporting fertility in horticultural system it's fed to the soil so it's a soil  feeder it's to improve soil quality, soil texture, there's a little bit of nutrient  available but we're not really looking at nutrients really more about adding organic  
**[0:15:46-0:16:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:15:46):**  matter to soil and particularly important is adding a range a whole diverse range of  biological activity particularly soil fauna and fungi which soil responds to very positively.  It's a process which takes about a year or a year and a quarter it doesn't rely on any  
**[0:16:02-0:16:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:02):**  external inputs at all it's run primarily on the sugars and proteins of fresh wood chip  this is trees that have been chipped up mostly going to waste and the process is dependent  primarily on wood fungi and bacterial action so there's no inputs from outside and the  
**[0:16:21-0:16:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:21):**  end result is a product which can be spread very safely onto farmland it can be used in  horticulture and it can be used for making a range of propagation compost.  The temperature remains quite constant so it doesn't go very very hot and then rapidly  
**[0:16:37-0:16:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:37):**  cool because what happens in a normal compost where you have a large amount of green material  is that you get very rapid heating up and then because it becomes so hot it kills all  the micrology so the microbiology tends to die off because of high heat temperatures.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:16:52):**  In the wood chip system you don't get the same effect you get quite high temperature  rise but you get a very low temperature gradient going down I'm not sure why that is but it's  more because we're dependent on soil fungi rather than nitrogen to rot the material down.  
**[0:17:08-0:17:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:08):**  Nitrogen is the driver in conventional compost making you need lots of nitrogen to rot down  the carbon.  In a wood chip system you're not relying on nitrogen at all because there's none effectively  
**[0:17:19-0:17:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:19):**  it's carbon and carbon only there's almost no nitrogen so you're relying on wood fungi  and soil bacteria which behave in a completely different way.  It can be done on virtually any scale so the minimum size really would be around 5 cubic  
**[0:17:33-0:17:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:33):**  meters and there is no upper maximum size other than the constraints of your site.  And what about getting wood chip because I know you said you get it from a local tree  specialist and I know wood chippers are really really expensive.  
**[0:17:46-0:18:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:17:46):**  A lot of tree surgeons have to pay quite a large amount of money to take their material  to either composting sites, municipal composting sites or to landfill sites so they have to  pay a fee to deposit so they're looking for places where maybe not such a high fee or  
**[0:18:04-0:18:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:04):**  no fee at all and places which are very local to them.  Because they're generally going to municipal composting sites they often have to travel  quite a long way and for them that's usually the problem more than the actual cost it's  
**[0:18:16-0:18:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:16):**  the travel so it's time so they're looking for somewhere which is on their way home on  a daily basis we receive material almost daily during the winter.  So it's convenient to them, convenience is really more important than the cost of leaving  
**[0:18:30-0:18:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:30):**  the material behind.  And can you talk a little bit about your experiment growing things on top of the compost heap?  Yeah that was kind of an off the cuff experiment really to try and see if we could maximize  
**[0:18:42-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:42):**  some of the heat that was coming from the compost during the winter because it gives  off enormous amounts of heat.  So during a very cold winter 2012 it was we did some trials with growing some sallys in  
**[0:18:53-0:19:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:18:53):**  December which you wouldn't normally do on top of the compost heap outside with nothing  more than a very thin plastic cover to keep the snow off and we had some really interesting  results in that we were able to grow right away through the winter with no supplementary  
**[0:19:07-0:19:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:07):**  inputs whatsoever using wood chip compost as a growing medium in modules and taking  the heat from the residual heat from the heap itself in order to keep the plants growing  with the higher increased temperature is very successful.  
**[0:19:22-0:19:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:22):**  The only difficulty is in this climate is providing enough light because things will  grow with the heat but they get quite leggy but we did successfully manage to grow some  quite good solid crops at the time of year which we wouldn't normally be doing it.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:36):**  It's interesting to learn about the different types of compost and chatting more with Ian  we realised how little was understood about why the compost behaved as it did or about  the different fungi and microbiology working away.  
**[0:19:50-0:20:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:19:50):**  We also love the idea of using the compost residual heat for other purposes like growing  salad in winter.  And now last but not least the secret sauce.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:07):**  Abby's family farm olives, vines, orchards and vegetable gardens organically in Chile.  Everything's dry farmed except the veg so whilst the olives continue to grow slowly  they started making natural wine from the very old vines on the land and then this happened.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:27):**  Bear juice did I hear that right?  No, bear juice is a French term meaning green juice and in fact agras is the Spanish term  of well the Spanish term meaning a bitter juice or bitter and here in Chile we call  
**[0:20:53-0:21:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:20:53):**  it agras.  Okay so it's bear juice and just because you're speaking with a Spanish accent you say bear  juice.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:04):**  Si.  One day I happened to be listening to a BBC food and farming podcast and they were talking  about bear juice, bear juice being a juice that's harvested or made from grapes or crab  
**[0:21:30-0:21:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:30):**  apples or some sort of juice.  That sounded really interesting it sounded like something we could give it make so we  set out to have a go.  
**[0:21:46-0:22:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:21:46):**  One of the unique things about it is it comes from the time in the harvest or well before  the harvest early in the season when we're thinning the grapes.  So normally those grapes would just be dropped on the ground and not used.  
**[0:22:05-0:22:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:22:05):**  So we took these grapes and produces agras.  This very bitter, very sharp juice that has many many possibilities.  We use it for salad dressings, we use it for tall drinks or cocktails or in cooking where  
**[0:22:36-0:23:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:22:36):**  you would use lemon juice or vinegar is commonly used and it's just a more subtle gentler acidity  and doesn't overpower or dominate flavors.  It allows the flavors to be brightened and sharpened without dominating them.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:00):**  There's a beetroot salad I particularly love that the agras really enhances.  You use it as you would vinegar so it's not overpowering.  So the same ratio, actually you can use a little bit more agras than you would vinegar  
**[0:23:20-0:23:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:20):**  or lemon juice because it is more subtle.  It's a wine friendly condiment.  That means if you're having a wine with the meal you don't want it to be overpowered with  
**[0:23:34-0:24:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:23:34):**  the acidity of lemon juice or the acidity of vinegars and agras is the perfect solution.  We thin the grapes in order to focus the energy on the grapes that we want to make wine with.  So by eliminating some of the grapes the energy of the plant or the vines goes into the grapes  
**[0:24:02-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:02):**  that are left and the ones that are removed are obviously removed.  And so normally they're a byproduct or a waste product but you're actually using them to  make a different type of juice, is that right?  
**[0:24:20-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:20):**  That's correct and that grape juice is very, very bitter, very green and quite firm and  in the firmness it's one of the issues is how much juice is in those grapes early in  the season.  
**[0:24:41-0:25:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:24:41):**  So it's a little bit of a balance as to when to do that.  But anyway we've gained some experience finding out when is the best time and now our agras  is maturing in its both consistency but also quality.  
**[0:25:03-0:25:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:03):**  If someone else wanted to make agras kind of what do you think are the main learnings  or what are the main things to think about?  One of the things is what we were just talking about, the timing.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:15):**  Because if you wait too late the fermentation, the grape, the juice could possibly ferment.  So I think very important is finding the right time to do it.  Any tips for the actual making of it?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:31):**  Because I know that some people for example would just, in a similar way to wine, they  put sulfates in at the end of the process to prevent fermentation.  Are you doing that?  
**[0:25:43-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:25:43):**  No.  We simply do what we would consider a very natural process of harvesting the grape, crushing  the grape, pressing it, getting the juice and then simply taking that juice and bottling  
**[0:26:03-0:26:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:03):**  it.  You can and it may be necessary also to pasteurize some of it depending on what you're doing  with it or where you're sending it or who wants it.  
**[0:26:20-0:26:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:20):**  It is amazing and surprisingly it's really nice on a fruit salad or with fresh fruit,  chilled with a little bit of agras.  Lovely.  
**[0:26:39-0:27:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:26:39):**  For me, basically the most exciting thing is that it's very simple to produce in many  ways and yet it has real unique quality.  It brings this kind of not just freshness but sharpness to a range of different foods  
**[0:27:05-0:27:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:27:05):**  and drinks that is just special.  That was Tom and Christine or mum and dad as they're known to Abby talking about this  very special condiment, verjuice or agras, the ultimate secret ingredient.  
**[0:27:27-0:27:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/07-farmerama#t=0:27:27):**  It's really not that easy to find verjuice or agras in the UK but you can go to our website  www.vdecycle.com to find out more or try making some yourself with some unripe grapes or crab  apples.
