### Farmerama  (Sat, 11 Mar 2017 09:13:05)
**[0:00:00-0:00:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:00):**  Hello and welcome to Farmerama!  
**[0:00:04-0:00:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:04):**  This episode is slightly different to usual.  
**[0:00:06-0:00:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:06):**  We're recording at Silo in Brighton, with today's co-host,  
**[0:00:10-0:00:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:10):**  EcoChef Doug McMaster.  
**[0:00:12-0:00:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:12):**  He's going to be talking to us about his zero waste philosophy  
**[0:00:16-0:00:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:16):**  and how this transforms what it means to serve food.  
**[0:00:20-0:00:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:20):**  Doug and his suppliers Emil and Miriam will be with us  
**[0:00:23-0:00:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:23):**  as we also hear from Joel Salatin  
**[0:00:25-0:00:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:25):**  as he tells us his tips for respecting the pigness of the pig  
**[0:00:29-0:00:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:29):**  and Abi goes on a walk to learn about the craft of managing ancient woodland  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:33):**  sustainably and profitably, now and for many generations to come.  
**[0:00:43-0:00:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:43):**  You know Abi and I and...  
**[0:00:44-0:00:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:44):**  Nigel, I'm here.  
**[0:00:46-0:00:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:46):**  And I'm Doug, I'm the chef and owner of Silo.  
**[0:00:50-0:00:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:50):**  And I'm Emil and I keep large black pigs, small hauling in Sussex.  
**[0:00:55-0:01:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:00:55):**  My name is Miriam and I'm Emil's partner and I'm co-managing the pigs.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:14):**  So Silo began as a zero waste restaurant.  
**[0:01:16-0:01:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:16):**  Actually, it began as a zero waste café in Melbourne in 2012.  
**[0:01:20-0:01:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:20):**  We successfully didn't have a bin for a year before I needed to come home.  
**[0:01:26-0:01:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:26):**  I came home to the UK and set up Silo in Brighton.  
**[0:01:30-0:01:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:30):**  Everything that comes into Silo doesn't have any packaging.  
**[0:01:34-0:01:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:34):**  If it is packaged, then it's natural packaging.  
**[0:01:37-0:01:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:37):**  So biodegradable materials etc.  
**[0:01:39-0:01:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:39):**  And then everything that isn't eaten by us, by our customers  
**[0:01:45-0:01:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:45):**  is then eaten by the compost machine.  
**[0:01:48-0:01:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:48):**  100% or 99.9% of every material that comes in only leaves as compost.  
**[0:01:55-0:02:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:01:55):**  But to achieve that system, we had to start milling flour and churning butter  
**[0:02:02-0:02:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:02):**  and making our own yoghurt and fermenting food and butchering whole animals  
**[0:02:05-0:02:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:05):**  rather than processed animals.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:07):**  So we kind of created what we lovingly describe as caveman cooking.  
**[0:02:12-0:02:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:12):**  Doing everything from scratch.  
**[0:02:15-0:02:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:15):**  And then realised that our end product was a very unique end product.  
**[0:02:20-0:02:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:20):**  It looked different and it certainly tasted different.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:23):**  And we don't have any sort of data but we are sure that our food is incredibly healthy  
**[0:02:29-0:02:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:29):**  because of the way in which we are producing the food.  
**[0:02:33-0:02:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:33):**  Wheat or any grain as soon as it is broken, cracked open, it starts to die.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:40):**  72 hours as they say loses 80% of its natural quality.  
**[0:02:44-0:02:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:44):**  We are principally milling flour for that reason now.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:49):**  It began with zero waste but now it is to, because this is the way flour or wheat should be  
**[0:02:56-0:03:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:02:56):**  digested into our bodies and the same for all different grains we use.  
**[0:03:00-0:03:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:00):**  In lots of when you describe what it is you do, you use the word respect quite a lot.  
**[0:03:04-0:03:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:04):**  So your respect in the food chain almost.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:07):**  Can you talk a little bit about what that means to you and how that relates to how you deal with  
**[0:03:13-0:03:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:13):**  your suppliers?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:15):**  I think in terms of how I respect the source of food is the simple knowing that the most  
**[0:03:23-0:03:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:23):**  sustainable nutrient dense food from the best environment is the most delicious food.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:32):**  So if the most sustainable food is the most delicious food, there is this beautiful synergy.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:37):**  So Emil approached me and Silo about five months ago and for the last two or three months we have  
**[0:03:45-0:03:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:45):**  been using his large black pork.  
**[0:03:47-0:03:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:47):**  For me the first time I ate this pork it changed everything.  
**[0:03:53-0:04:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:03:53):**  It changed my perspective on how good this sort of protein, this pig, this meat could be and it  
**[0:04:02-0:04:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:02):**  changed the way I want to serve that meat.  
**[0:04:04-0:04:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:04):**  I am very specific about the meat we use at Silo.  
**[0:04:08-0:04:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:08):**  It is certainly a very small percentage of the product we serve and then when we do serve it,  
**[0:04:13-0:04:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:13):**  it has to be almost religious how important the preparation and how important that produce has  
**[0:04:22-0:04:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:22):**  been reared and handled from birth even.  
**[0:04:26-0:04:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:26):**  The expression you eat, I believe in that for everything.  
**[0:04:34-0:04:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:34):**  If a gem lettuce is grown hydroponically, it is never going to taste as good as it is if it is  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:39):**  grown in amazing nutrient soil.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:42):**  It is sort of appreciation of source.  
**[0:04:46-0:04:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:46):**  Well, I am very excited that my meat got to this restaurant straight away because I have only  
**[0:04:51-0:04:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:51):**  started keeping this large black one year ago almost now, so I did my research a little bit and  
**[0:04:56-0:05:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:04:56):**  I found out that large black was supposed to have very good meat.  
**[0:05:01-0:05:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:01):**  So for me it was just, okay, I am going to try this out and see if it is true.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:06):**  Well, a bit like Doug said, it was amazing.  
**[0:05:09-0:05:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:09):**  It was such a wonderful flavor, especially the fats.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:12):**  They were so concentrated, the sweetness, it is just amazing.  
**[0:05:15-0:05:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:15):**  And I started thinking, why is that?  
**[0:05:17-0:05:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:17):**  The thing is I also work in organic orchard, so I am getting a lot of waste fruit, apples,  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:22):**  plums and pears, all sorts of things.  
**[0:05:24-0:05:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:24):**  And I am also working at a plough hatch farm, which is a biodynamic dairy farm also in Sussex.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:30):**  And sometimes I take some waste milk from there and I feed all that to my pigs.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:35):**  And they have got a lot of space.  
**[0:05:37-0:05:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:37):**  So they are grazing and rooting on quite a large field and I feed them organic pellets myself.  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:44):**  So their diet is very varied.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:46):**  So the sort of zero waste philosophy of your own growing the restaurant is also your own growing that in your...  
**[0:05:51-0:05:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:51):**  Absolutely. That is what I actually want to do.  
**[0:05:53-0:05:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:53):**  So anything that I can reuse from other farms, that is basically how pigs used to be reared as well.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:05:58):**  They were a byproduct of, for example, the beer industry.  
**[0:06:02-0:06:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:02):**  They would eat the barley that was used for making beer.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:07):**  Or they were reared on whey, which is a byproduct of cheese making.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:12):**  So it just makes complete sense to do that.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:15):**  But at the moment it is quite difficult now in the UK to feed kitchen wasted pigs.  
**[0:06:20-0:06:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:20):**  I think it is not even allowed.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:22):**  But I can definitely feed them a bit of apple and a bit of leftover milk.  
**[0:06:25-0:06:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:25):**  So you are supplying a couple of large black pigs a month to Sido.  
**[0:06:31-0:06:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:31):**  And you are supplying the whole, so you bring the whole carcass, you take it to the abattoir, get it sorted.  
**[0:06:37-0:06:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:37):**  That is right.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:38):**  And then drop it here and Douglas takes care of it essentially.  
**[0:06:42-0:06:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:42):**  And obviously Doug, I guess you are very happy to pay a premium.  
**[0:06:46-0:06:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:46):**  You are not paying the global supply and demand price for pork, right?  
**[0:06:50-0:06:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:50):**  I mean this is a premium product.  
**[0:06:52-0:06:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:52):**  Absolutely.  
**[0:06:53-0:06:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:53):**  Me and Emil talked this through as we do.  
**[0:06:57-0:07:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:06:57):**  And it did not take a lot of negotiation to find a price that made his end of the bargain streamlined.  
**[0:07:06-0:07:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:06):**  I.e. not having to prep anything.  
**[0:07:08-0:07:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:08):**  And for us, we knew what we were getting, this quality, this sort of superior flavour.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:14):**  And knowing obviously that it is from a great source.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:17):**  We have lots of interesting ways to manage whole preparation.  
**[0:07:23-0:07:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:23):**  So there is a reason why restaurants do not prep their own food anymore.  
**[0:07:30-0:07:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:30):**  There is part of this industrial model where everything is pre-produced.  
**[0:07:34-0:07:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:34):**  And then it is just sort of served in restaurants these days.  
**[0:07:37-0:07:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:37):**  Even Michelin star restaurants.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:39):**  They just buy in done items and finish them.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:42):**  Put them on a plate and win a Michelin star.  
**[0:07:44-0:07:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:44):**  Now we are totally the other end of the spectrum where we do everything from scratch.  
**[0:07:49-0:07:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:49):**  And it has taken two years and we are still learning.  
**[0:07:52-0:08:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:07:52):**  But we found ways to make whole animal butchery and milling flour feasible for a restaurant.  
**[0:08:00-0:08:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:00):**  We have simplified the end product.  
**[0:08:02-0:08:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:02):**  Which is also beneficial gastronomically when you eat something so good.  
**[0:08:08-0:08:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:08):**  It is almost better to serve less.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:11):**  Because your palate can focus on the superior items.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:16):**  So it is a sort of win-win.  
**[0:08:19-0:08:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:19):**  Because we are doing less prep which means we can do more prep.  
**[0:08:23-0:08:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:23):**  I.e. milling flour, churning butter, rolling oats, fermenting food, butchering whole animals.  
**[0:08:28-0:08:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:28):**  And the end product is better for it.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:35](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:31):**  Well, because I get a very fair price for my product.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:35):**  It actually gives me a lot of freedom.  
**[0:08:37-0:08:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:37):**  That means that I can start growing my business.  
**[0:08:40-0:08:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:40):**  Because I am very small at the moment.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:42):**  That actually has benefits as well.  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:44):**  Because now I can cater to what you guys need.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:46):**  So zero waste.  
**[0:08:47-0:08:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:47):**  That is why I got these industrial large crates.  
**[0:08:50-0:08:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:50):**  That I bring the pigs in.  
**[0:08:52-0:08:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:52):**  And I take them home, wash them and I can reuse them again.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:54):**  So there is indeed no waste.  
**[0:08:56-0:08:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:56):**  Which is completely in line with what I believe in anyway.  
**[0:08:59-0:09:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:08:59):**  So this cooperation for me is fantastic.  
**[0:09:02-0:09:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:02):**  Because this is what I want as well.  
**[0:09:13-0:09:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:13):**  A few weeks ago, Abbie and Nigel met Joel Salatin at a Sustainable Food Trust event.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:18):**  Discussing the future of livestock.  
**[0:09:20-0:09:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:20):**  Joel is a world renowned alternative thinking mixed livestock farmer from Virginia.  
**[0:09:26-0:09:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:26):**  Over the next few episodes we are going to hear a few stories from him.  
**[0:09:30-0:09:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:30):**  Pigs don't like electric fences.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:32):**  And so Joel cleverly encloses temporary paddocks with electric fences and temporary wooden gates.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:38):**  So the pigs are happy to move on and do their rooty work in the next field.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:43):**  The pigs are real smart.  
**[0:09:44-0:09:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:44):**  Pigs are I think the smartest animal really.  
**[0:09:47-0:09:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:47):**  They don't trust you with that electric fence gate like cows do.  
**[0:09:53-0:09:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:53):**  As easily.  
**[0:09:54-0:09:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:54):**  They will eventually but they are pretty difficult starting off.  
**[0:09:58-0:10:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:09:58):**  The cows, when you open an electric fence gate and call the group routinely,  
**[0:10:03-0:10:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:03):**  they just run through the electric fence gate and you close it and it's done.  
**[0:10:06-0:10:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:06):**  Pigs aren't like that.  
**[0:10:07-0:10:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:07):**  They say, no there is an electric fence there, I can't see it but I know it's been there and I'm not going to cross it.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:13):**  So we make sure that all the pig paddocks have a wooden gate, a space where you can put a wooden gate in.  
**[0:10:19-0:10:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:19):**  It doesn't have to be two meters, it's plenty.  
**[0:10:23-0:10:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:23):**  It's just a wooden gate.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:24):**  The pigs are used to rubbing up on it.  
**[0:10:26-0:10:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:26):**  They can see it.  
**[0:10:27-0:10:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:27):**  Suddenly you remove it to move them in.  
**[0:10:29-0:10:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:29):**  Well they then run right in to the next paddock where you wouldn't be able to get them in for a day with an electric fence gate.  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:38):**  And then you just take that gate and beat the pigs to the end of the paddock and set it up at the far end.  
**[0:10:45-0:10:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:45):**  And then once the pigs move in, you take the old back gate, you move it in as the back gate.  
**[0:10:50-0:10:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:50):**  And so you're just moving these gates, a paddock forward.  
**[0:10:54-0:11:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:10:54):**  So you can have ten paddocks with two gates simply rotating the gates through just with the pigs.  
**[0:11:05-0:11:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:05):**  That makes me laugh a bit, because of course I keep pigs as well.  
**[0:11:08-0:11:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:08):**  And it's true about the electric fence.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:10):**  They know very well where the electric fence line is.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:13):**  There are several solutions to this.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:15):**  First of all I tried moving them at feeding time.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:19):**  So I got my bucket of food, removed the fence, and then I found that half of them followed the food.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:26):**  The other half thought, no no, there's an electric fence there, I'm not going across that line.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:31):**  And of course the first ones are already tentative.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:33):**  But the moment they cross the line, then they're like, okay, we're out, it's fine, there's no electric fence, off we go.  
**[0:11:38-0:11:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:38):**  You have to find a solution, because they didn't want to leave them in an empty field.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:41):**  So what I came up with in the end was actually get my trailer there and then open the lid over the electric fence line.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:51):**  And then have food in the trailer.  
**[0:11:53-0:12:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:11:53):**  So they walked on the trailer, because they didn't mind crossing the line while walking on wood for some reason.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:00):**  Which is an interesting pig psychology thing.  
**[0:12:02-0:12:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:02):**  So they went on the trailer eventually, it took a while.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:05):**  And that's the thing with livestock handling, especially with pigs.  
**[0:12:09-0:12:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:09):**  Patience is key. You cannot rush them.  
**[0:12:13-0:12:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:13):**  Pigs are definitely curious.  
**[0:12:15-0:12:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:15):**  So you can kind of handle them by kindling that curiosity.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:22):**  But you can also create a really individual relationship with them.  
**[0:12:27-0:12:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:27):**  Which, I don't know exactly, but with pigs or, sorry, with sheep that's slightly different.  
**[0:12:32-0:12:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:32):**  You can get the odd character and stuff like that.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:34):**  But yeah, I think perhaps pigs probably are more intelligent as Joel suggested.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:40):**  They're very individual characters.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:42):**  The two sows that I've got, they're very different.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:45):**  And that's actually for me also a pleasure of working with pigs.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:51):**  Is that curiosity that Maryann was talking about.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:12:57):**  Teddy Brunn owns and cares for a few thousand acres of ancient woodland in Norfolk, which is in the UK.  
**[0:13:03-0:13:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:03):**  Abby visited recently and was overwhelmed by what looked like a wild wonderland to the naked eye.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:09):**  But this long-standing, self-sustaining business is far from wild.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:13):**  Here's Teddy and his son Freddy to talk us through their careful single-selection woodland management techniques,  
**[0:13:20-0:13:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:20):**  which underpin this carefully crafted landscape.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:38):**  These beech all planted at the same time.  
**[0:13:42-0:13:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:42):**  You can see how differently they've grown.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:46):**  Yeah, wow, it's double the size.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:49):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:13:51-0:13:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:51):**  Because they haven't had the same opportunities this tree has.  
**[0:13:54-0:14:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:13:54):**  These beech are doing these trees a lot of good in that they're keeping their trunks in darkness so they're not producing shoots.  
**[0:14:04-0:14:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:04):**  You don't want lots of little branches growing out of them.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:08):**  They're called epicormic shoots.  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:11):**  So that's really all those beech trees are doing.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:15):**  They're not being grown for any particular value and they're never going to make valuable trees, ever.  
**[0:14:23-0:14:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:23):**  If you were going to do a thinning now in this woodland where these trees are 80 years old.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:29):**  Teddy?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:31):**  Well, they're 70 years old.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:34):**  They're 60 years old.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:36):**  I thought they were planted in 1954.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:40):**  No, 51.  
**[0:14:41-0:14:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:41):**  51, so they're 70.  
**[0:14:43-0:14:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:43):**  What would you market them?  
**[0:14:45-0:14:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:45):**  How would you sell them?  
**[0:14:47-0:14:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:47):**  You'd cut them down?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:48):**  Well, if you were cutting a tree like this down.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:53):**  To make a knife for a better one.  
**[0:14:56-0:14:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:56):**  Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be cutting that one down.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:14:59):**  If you were cutting it down, then up to that first branch, I think one would, because of the quality of it,  
**[0:15:08-0:15:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:08):**  you'd probably get them at Rideside and get somebody to come bid for them.  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:14):**  We would probably process it and sell it to a firewood merchant.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:19):**  Or cut it up into sizeable lengths and sell it to a firewood merchant.  
**[0:15:24-0:15:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:24):**  Depending on what the price and demand for firewood is.  
**[0:15:28-0:15:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:28):**  Like anything, if you're going to buy a product, you can really see and understand its quality.  
**[0:15:33-0:15:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:33):**  And that, I think, is where a lot of people go wrong. They'll leave a huge heap of sticks for a firewood merchant.  
**[0:15:41-0:15:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:41):**  But if you lay those sticks out in a nice pile, so he can measure the volume of it easily,  
**[0:15:47-0:15:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:47):**  he can pay you.  
**[0:15:49-0:15:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:49):**  Because firewood merchants don't pay you for each individual log in a heap.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:15:54):**  You might sell a firewood merchant logs at two metres long.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:04):**  In here, you can see these larch are nice trees, they're nice and straight, and they're growing tall.  
**[0:16:14-0:16:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:14):**  This is from 1988. This small area here blew down in a big hurricane in 1987.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:24):**  I heard about that hurricane. It crossed the whole UK, didn't it?  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:27):**  Yeah, some parts very badly.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:30):**  It was just after I was born.  
**[0:16:33-0:16:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:33):**  That dates you.  
**[0:16:36-0:16:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:36):**  Oh dear.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:38):**  So here, I like this situation here. That'll never make a tree, but there's quite a lot of regeneration going on here.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:48):**  So that when you remove the overstory, they can carry on growing.  
**[0:16:53-0:16:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:53):**  You didn't plant those as such, they just developed. Is that right? The understory?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:16:59):**  The understory has developed on its own, yeah.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:05):**  All the trees in the wood, there's hundreds of seed-bearing trees in the wood.  
**[0:17:12-0:17:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:12):**  And so those trees, that understory, are basically enabling you to continue drawing a profitable income.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:30](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:25):**  As you fell the larger trees, you have a tree ready to replace it,  
**[0:17:30-0:17:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:30):**  which is a system that seems to have a more sustainable income than if you were clear-felling and restocking,  
**[0:17:37-0:17:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:37):**  because then you've got to wait for a longer period of time before you can draw money from the next crop.  
**[0:17:42-0:17:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:42):**  Is that fair?  
**[0:17:44-0:17:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:44):**  Yes, let me do it.  
**[0:17:48-0:17:55](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:48):**  So that is, in essence, the model of single selection.  
**[0:17:55-0:17:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:55):**  You can take out an income much more regularly.  
**[0:17:58-0:18:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:17:58):**  You get a regular income, whereas with clear-cutting, you get a huge build-up in capital value on the site,  
**[0:18:11-0:18:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:11):**  and then you cut it down and then you start at naught again.  
**[0:18:15-0:18:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:15):**  If you make major interventions in a wood by clear-cutting, then you let the wind in,  
**[0:18:26-0:18:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:26):**  and you can have associated problems with that in terms of catastrophic storm damage and so on.  
**[0:18:36-0:18:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:36):**  You may have to protect them against rabbits and deer and that sort of thing.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:41):**  You can see the deer damage, you can see where there's strips of wood in the tree,  
**[0:18:45-0:18:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:45):**  and that has a major impact on the growth of the tree.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:48):**  So how do you prevent that?  
**[0:18:50-0:18:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:50):**  Bang, bang!  
**[0:18:51-0:18:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:51):**  It's a really underdone thing.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:53):**  There's no natural predators and it takes a real commitment.  
**[0:18:56-0:18:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:56):**  The Forestry Commission are very proactive.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:18:59):**  They encourage people to be very proactive so you can receive grants for controlling deer.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:04):**  It's something that we probably don't do quite enough of at the moment, but people will pay money to do.  
**[0:19:10-0:19:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:10):**  Obviously venison has a value, although it's undervalued by the UK.  
**[0:19:14-0:19:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:14):**  Sure.  
**[0:19:15-0:19:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:15):**  Because people don't like to eat it, strangely enough.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:18):**  It's so healthy and delicious.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:20):**  It's very important that certain species that you get good problems,  
**[0:19:26-0:19:29](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:26):**  that means they come from good parents.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:29):**  Because on average they will throw better offspring than parents that are no good.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:42):**  But sometimes even if you've got good parents they will still throw bad offspring.  
**[0:19:50-0:20:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:19:50):**  But generally speaking with oak, the less oak you grow on an area,  
**[0:20:01-0:20:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:01):**  the less chance you have of establishing a really good stand of trees of good quality.  
**[0:20:10-0:20:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:10):**  Therefore, if you can get trees of the best provenance you can find,  
**[0:20:17-0:20:22](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:17):**  then you stand a better chance and you can plant a few less.  
**[0:20:22-0:20:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:22):**  You really have to spend money in order to see your money come back.  
**[0:20:27-0:20:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:27):**  The idea of planting 5,000 trees in a hectare to many people would seem like such a huge sum of money.  
**[0:20:33-0:20:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:33):**  They would never imagine that that would be worth their while.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:37):**  But of course, by doing that you enable yourself in the end to reach how many trees per hectare, the final crop?  
**[0:20:45-0:20:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:45):**  85.  
**[0:20:48-0:20:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:48):**  And that means that by the time the final stand is ready to be cut down,  
**[0:20:54-0:21:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:20:54):**  over the course of the 120 years you've taken out everything but the 85 of the oak that are standing, give or take.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:06](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:21:02):**  And does the oak that you take out in the medium term have any value?  
**[0:21:06-0:21:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:21:06):**  Yes, obviously as they get bigger the more valuable they become, but the less frequent you can do it.  
**[0:21:14-0:21:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:21:14):**  So as soon as you start thinning you're producing something in terms of low grade wood, firewood for example.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:21:25):**  But as the trees get bigger then the value of what you cut out of them increases.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:21:37):**  Right, we'll move on now.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:21:41):**  We make some money out of old and it's by working on them, you know.  
**[0:21:53-0:21:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:21:53):**  You're not going to make any money out of wood unless you sell something from it.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:21:58):**  And that's what we're doing all the time.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:22:01):**  There's some oak there, you see.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:22:04):**  They're planted in a pure situation there and they're competing with each other quite vigorously.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:22:15):**  And I can tell you that's going to be a very fine stand of oak.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:27](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:22:20):**  We had a group of oak here, you see there's one left there.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:22:27):**  Unfortunately there was only six oak or eight oak in each group and that was not enough to produce a decent quality tree.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:22:42):**  And they were planted with a conifer crop that was growing far too fast for them.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:22:48):**  So most of them didn't make it.  
**[0:22:51-0:23:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:22:51):**  So instead of turning out to be a final crop of oak in here we ended up with a mixture of conifers.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:12](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:01):**  My father at the time, silly old bugger that he wasn't, said you must plant Christmas trees in between the Corsican pine  
**[0:23:12-0:23:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:12):**  because then you can harvest the Christmas trees and sell them at Christmas time.  
**[0:23:19-0:23:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:19):**  So we did that and we sold thousands of Christmas trees out of here.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:23):**  The Christmas tree is a Norway spruce.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:26):**  Well, it was in those days.  
**[0:23:28-0:23:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:28):**  Now they have more exotic species.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:40](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:32):**  When do you think, if you were to start a forest now, when do you think you would first start seeing any income from it?  
**[0:23:40-0:23:43](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:40):**  If you bought a wood and planted one from scratch.  
**[0:23:43-0:23:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:43):**  If you planted one from scratch.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:45):**  Not until it was 20 years old.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:47):**  20 years old.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:48):**  Yeah.  
**[0:23:49-0:23:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:49):**  Okay.  
**[0:23:52-0:23:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:52):**  Nothing but expense.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:53):**  Have you ever had to fell a tree that you really didn't want to fell?  
**[0:23:56-0:23:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:56):**  No.  
**[0:23:57-0:23:58](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:57):**  Yes.  
**[0:23:58-0:24:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:23:58):**  I've had trees fell that I didn't want felled.  
**[0:24:00-0:24:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:00):**  But you don't become attached to a tree then?  
**[0:24:03-0:24:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:03):**  Do I hug trees?  
**[0:24:05-0:24:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:05):**  No, I said do you become attached to them?  
**[0:24:07-0:24:11](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:07):**  I thought you said did I don't chat to them?  
**[0:24:11-0:24:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:11):**  Do you?  
**[0:24:13-0:24:14](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:13):**  Not really.  
**[0:24:14-0:24:15](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:14):**  No?  
**[0:24:15-0:24:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:15):**  I'm not a tree hugger as such.  
**[0:24:17-0:24:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:17):**  I love them instead.  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:19):**  Oh good.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:23](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:20):**  You're a tree lover.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:34](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:23):**  So you never have had the situation where you're like, because someone really wants that tree I'm going to fell it but I don't want it.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:39](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:34):**  Somebody would pay me £20,000 to cut that tree down and I'd cut it down tomorrow.  
**[0:24:39-0:24:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:39):**  Okay, great.  
**[0:24:41-0:24:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:41):**  But no one would pay me that.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:44):**  No one would pay me anything for that.  
**[0:24:53-0:25:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:24:53):**  Getting back to the car.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:25:08):**  They're wonderfully managed.  
**[0:25:09-0:25:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:25:09):**  Tree by tree he goes around, he carefully looks and says okay that oak is 140 years old, it's now ready to be sold and they'll cut it down.  
**[0:25:18-0:25:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:25:18):**  But then in another area he's planting oaks and he sees that very much as like in 120 years time someone will be harvesting those.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:25:26):**  Such long term thinking, it totally blew my mind and that he, you know, it just was part of the business.  
**[0:25:32-0:25:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:25:32):**  And that he did care for the trees and he did see each tree almost individually.  
**[0:25:36-0:25:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:25:36):**  And for me what's inspiring is that for a lot of people out there who, you know, maybe are more conventional thinking or, you know, like what's the bottom line on this?  
**[0:25:45-0:25:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:25:45):**  This is a model of something that actually does have a sustainable bottom line and is helpful in so many ways to the environment.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:25:52):**  He has so much knowledge stored up in his head and it was amazing to walk around the forest with him and have him see everything, every layer that was going on.  
**[0:26:00-0:26:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:26:00):**  Oh well that in 10 years will be gone and that in 100 years will be gone.  
**[0:26:03-0:26:07](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:26:03):**  It was like wow, years and layers and it was insane.  
**[0:26:07-0:26:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:26:07):**  I mean this is kind of good for everybody, it's good for the world and I think it's going to be, there's going to be more opportunities for grants and funding and subsidies for people doing this sort of.  
**[0:26:19-0:26:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:26:19):**  Yeah, I was at a forestry event in Suffolk not too long ago and they were saying how part of the COP20 agreement in Paris, sorry COP20?  
**[0:26:31-0:26:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:26:31):**  Part of that agreement was that forestry or planting woodland became an official way of sequestering carbon.  
**[0:26:38-0:26:53](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:26:38):**  People were thinking that there would be new grants and schemes from the government coming in very shortly that would encourage people to plant more woodland because in 20 years time that woodland will be taking in quite a bit of carbon and that's when the goals need to be met.  
**[0:26:53-0:27:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:26:53):**  So that's an interesting perspective for farmers who may have a bit of land where they could plant some trees, there may be help from the government to kind of see out that 20 years when you're not necessarily getting any income as such.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:27:09):**  And the other exciting thing about it is going back to Joel Salatin, he keeps all of his pigs on the forest floor around him, sometimes on paddock and sometimes in forests.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:27:19):**  And so there's a huge potential for farmers in the UK to have that be kind of another mixed farming set up.  
**[0:27:26-0:27:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:27:26):**  Absolutely, I've seen it in a couple of places where the first few months after you've had pigs in the forest floor it looks quite damaged but actually what it does is it rejuvenates.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:45](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:27:37):**  So maybe the year after that you've got all sorts of plants that the seeds were hidden in the soil that couldn't push through the brambles and all the other stuff that was there.  
**[0:27:45-0:27:51](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:27:45):**  And suddenly you have highest things coming up or whatever, very interesting plants. So it actually really rejuvenates.  
**[0:27:51-0:28:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:27:51):**  Well on the 40 acres that I'm farming on half of it is sort of woodlands and interestingly enough I had a walk around and planning out what we're going to do with our fields yesterday.  
**[0:28:02-0:28:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:02):**  And we were talking about, okay this bit we're going to leave that to nature and we're going to plant a few trees there and that's just it.  
**[0:28:09-0:28:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:09):**  We're not even going to top it or maybe have a sheep in there now and then, that's it, we're just going to leave that.  
**[0:28:13-0:28:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:13):**  And this bit, okay yeah what's those, there's tree lines coming into the fields, those few young trees we're going to leave.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:19):**  So there's a lot of space for nature and the funny thing is I think the most important thing you can do to simplify it is actually to give room to diversity and complexity.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:31):**  That's it. If you do that, hopefully nature balances itself out a little bit.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:38):**  Because nutrients will be available, certain insects will be attracted to certain things that you never thought was going to grow in the woods and they bring a certain thing to your land.  
**[0:28:47-0:28:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:47):**  It's too much to actually really comprehend unless you make a real study of it per plot of land.  
**[0:28:52-0:28:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:52):**  It's a very natural but also very managed process. So it's very zero waste.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:28:57):**  At one point he was talking about the aim being enormous oak trees.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:29:01):**  There's all these different levels where you're taking things out and you're turning that essentially waste product into another kind of product.  
**[0:29:09-0:29:17](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:29:09):**  So there would be firewood or it would be chipped or it would be turned into mulch or a Christmas tree or exactly.  
**[0:29:17-0:29:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:29:17):**  I didn't actually say earlier but my inspiration behind Zero Waste and having a zero waste restaurant was the book One Straw Revolution.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:29:26):**  I think I've told you before this, Nigel, that reading this book he describes nature.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:29:32):**  I think you've got the same sort of lingo as Asanobu Fukuaka.  
**[0:29:36-0:29:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:29:36):**  He's a Japanese farmer philosopher. He's properly deep and hardcore philosophy that he's created on his own and uses nature as an example for his thoughts.  
**[0:29:50-0:30:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:29:50):**  He describes nature as this amazing symphony and then in it he describes in nature there is no waste.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:08](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:30:00):**  I always remember that sticking out and thinking this idea of zero waste is far more than this literal practice of not having a bin.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:30:08):**  You're almost respecting nature in being zero waste because nature is zero waste.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:21](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:30:13):**  So that has always been in my mind as just this beautiful simple idea that waste is like where we've gone wrong a bit.  
**[0:30:21-0:30:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:30:21):**  We've evolved and turned our backs on nature and then waste has occurred.  
**[0:30:28-0:30:31](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:30:28):**  I like the analogy with the symphony. I used to be a classical musician.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:30:31):**  Oh really?  
**[0:30:33-0:30:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:30:33):**  Interestingly enough I think if you have to manage a piece of land you're sort of a conductor because you have all these instruments at your disposal and you're trying to create something very beautiful.  
**[0:30:42-0:31:00](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:30:42):**  I think if you're aiming for something beautiful which sounds a bit wishy-washy but I think if you try that with all these different instruments as well as aspects whether it be trees or micro-risal activity in the soil or livestock that you're keeping or all these things balancing out together creating something very nice.  
**[0:31:00-0:31:09](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:31:00):**  Beautiful craft. I think the more we can see farming as a craft the more respect people will have for it and the more understanding.  
**[0:31:09-0:31:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:31:09):**  That was one thing that came up at the livestock event was Joel said it's farmers as craftsmen as opposed to farmers as commodity.  
**[0:31:20-0:31:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:31:20):**  Yeah crafty versus commodity sort of factory farming versus artisan farming.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:37](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:31:28):**  One of the problems for me with artisan is that that's so associated with an elite specialised market nowadays that word artisan.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:52](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:31:37):**  I think really the reason I like crafty or craft is because that's not got such associations it's just much more like acknowledging that a lot goes into it and that doesn't necessarily mean that what comes out is not available to everyone.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:31:52):**  I like that.  
**[0:31:54-0:32:01](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:31:54):**  Is that something that Sino has almost wrestled with slightly? How to describe a, is it post-industrial restaurant?  
**[0:32:01-0:32:03](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:32:01):**  Pre-post-industrial.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:32:03):**  Change of mind everyone.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:25](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:32:05):**  No absolutely. So my business plan has always been to kind of shift the focus on a subject which hasn't been until now a very enticing, attractive and certainly delicious subject.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:32](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:32:25):**  You know sustainability. You put the word sustainability into a sentence with food you're not hungry or you don't want to.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:42](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:32:32):**  If I say this restaurant down the road is sustainable this sustainable that sustainable the other and then describe another restaurant with this beautifully caramelised da da da you want to go to this one.  
**[0:32:42-0:32:48](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:32:42):**  So I've always been very conscious of making what this model is attractive.  
**[0:32:48-0:33:02](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:32:48):**  You know if you're really interested go on our social media or go on our website but you don't come in and get touted with all this sort of how to change the world in scripture.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:33:02):**  You just have a nice time hopefully.  
**[0:33:05-0:33:18](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:33:05):**  I have my, it's a bit of a joke but like the dirty words of Silo like don't say vegan don't say sustainable. I don't actually say that to my staff but it's we can all get it.  
**[0:33:18-0:33:24](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:33:18):**  I'll always use the word plant food not vegan food on our social media for instance or our plant menu even.  
**[0:33:24-0:33:47](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:33:24):**  Yeah we're very conscious of how and which the sort of message comes across.  
**[0:33:47-0:33:50](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:33:47):**  From a chef's perspective what do you see as the future of farming?  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:33:50):**  I just want to see like I want to connect.  
**[0:33:54-0:34:05](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:33:54):**  I think that you know we all know that there's this disconnect but knowing what's going on on the farm you know there's beautiful ideas of technology.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:20](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:34:05):**  You know I have an amazing organic vegetable farmer called Toose and every time I go to her farm Lane's Organics I see 20 things that aren't on her list.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:28](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:34:20):**  I'm like Toose I will buy this from you I will use this and you know essentially this is extra profit for you like just tell me it's here.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:38](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:34:28):**  And she just she she writes me this list like on a pen and paper on the back of a scrap piece of paper but like we knew what was going on on that farm.  
**[0:34:38-0:34:44](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:34:38):**  You know so much would be different so it's kind of like knowing it's that connecting to the farm.  
**[0:34:44-0:34:56](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:34:44):**  I'm not necessarily saying we do it through technology but that is quite a nice illuminating idea that we can see what's going on on the farm and just having a connection to it.  
**[0:34:56-0:35:10](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:34:56):**  And now once more to Joel Salatin with another idea which sees the future of farming tied to a deeper understanding of what's happening on the land almost live.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:19](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:35:10):**  This was in response to Nigel speculatively asking him about technology he was looking forward to seeing being introduced into farming in the years and decades to come.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:36](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:35:19):**  I think there are some really cool pieces of infrastructure that would be neat and one would be some sort of video surveillance of especially water tanks water troughs for the herds of cows on rental land on our land.  
**[0:35:36-0:35:49](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:35:36):**  Some of them are you know 10 12 miles away. You got a herd of 400 cows 12 miles away. Boy it'd really be great to see real time video coverage of the water the water trough especially.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:57](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:35:49):**  Yeah. That it's up the water's full. You know it's all they haven't dumped it over the pump didn't stop you know those kinds of things.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:13](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:35:57):**  So I think that that video that cheap accessible video surveillance we've actually played around with it a lot. Right now we still don't have enough completely ubiquitous phone cell phone service to be able to all work on cell phone towers.  
**[0:36:13-0:36:26](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:36:13):**  Yeah. So that's one that I'm looking for. I think that will come to where we can go down in the morning and part of chores that go down in the morning and I punch punch the computer monitors and I can bring up every water trough.  
**[0:36:26-0:36:41](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:36:26):**  Involved with the system and yep that one's working that one's working that one's working that would that would really help my day be stress free.  
**[0:36:41-0:36:46](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:36:41):**  It's Christmas Day.  
**[0:36:46-0:36:59](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:36:46):**  You got some nice presents. That's all from Farmerama for this month and this year. And we look forward to continuing the journey with all of you in the New Year. So thanks so much from all of us.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:16](https://soundcloud.com/farmerama-radio/17-farmerama#t=0:36:59):**  Thanks from all of us and well, what do you say goodbye? I'll see you at the silo and goodbye from Doug. Bye from Abby. Goodbye from Nigel. Goodbye from Emile. And Miriam as well.
