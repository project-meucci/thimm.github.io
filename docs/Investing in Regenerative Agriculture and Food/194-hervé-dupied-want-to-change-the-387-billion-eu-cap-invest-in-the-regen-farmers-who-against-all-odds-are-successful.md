### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (2022-11-22)  
### Author(s): Koen van Seijen  

**[0:00:00-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:00:00):**  Do you want to learn more on how to put money to work in regenerative food and agriculture?  Follow our video course via investinginregenerativeagriculture.com or in the links below.  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:00:14):**  Today we talk about policies.  But don't worry, it won't be boring at all.  What is needed to change one of the largest farming subsidy schemes in the world, the  
**[0:00:22-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:00:22):**  CAP or the Common Agriculture Policy, here in Europe?  Mind you, this is over 400 billion every 7 years in Europe and most of it goes towards  not regenerative practices.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:00:33):**  And thus, most of the agriculture system in Europe is in a very, very bad shape.  So what is needed to change this and what pathways and successful examples do we have  of European policy change?  
**[0:00:44-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:00:44):**  This is a much more optimistic and practical interview than you might imagine.  It's about how to gather the pioneers in the regen and agroecology movement who, against  all odds and honestly against all subsidies, have built very successful food and agriculture  
**[0:00:58-0:01:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:00:58):**  companies.  Not enormous, but they employ people, produce a lot of food and keep their ecosystem in  a very healthy shape.  
**[0:01:04-0:01:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:01:04):**  How do we empower them to replicate their success?  What's the role of investments here?  And how do we create a strong enough voice in Brussels to change the rules of the game?  
**[0:01:16-0:01:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:01:16):**  This is the Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food podcast, Investing as if the planet  mattered, where we talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:33-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:01:33):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  Why my focus on soil and regeneration?  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:44-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:01:44):**  our land and our sea, grow our food, what we eat, wear and consume.  And it's time that we as investors, big and small and consumers, start paying much more  attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:01:56):**  To make it easy for fans to support our work, we launched our membership community and so  many of you have joined us as a member.  Thank you.

Welcome to another episode today with a former Patagonia worker who spent five years with  the EMEA headquarters in Amsterdam working on agriculture and energy and then went back  
**[0:02:35-0:02:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:02:35):**  to his village in France to reopen the cafe of his ancestors and work on the farm and  of course work on a university actually of farmers.  But most importantly, and as we'll spend most of the time here on the podcast, we'll be  
**[0:02:45-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:02:45):**  talking about policy and why we have to change the cup in Europe, which spends most of the  European budget on farms and on farming, let's say not in a very regenerative way.  And so unless we change that, regenerative farming will always be some playing in the  
**[0:03:01-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:03:01):**  margin as they say, I think in Dutch.  So welcome Herve, I'm very much looking forward to this conversation, which has been a few  years in the making.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:03:08):**  And I'm looking forward to unpack so much with you this morning.  Hi Koon, hi everyone.  Happy to be here.  
**[0:03:15-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:03:15):**  And let's start with the obvious question.  I mean, you grew up in a small village in France.  What ended up your journey because you could have stayed in Amsterdam working in Patagonia  
**[0:03:27-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:03:27):**  or somewhere else.  I mean, in terms of corporate career, that's probably as high as you get.  Like what made you come back to the land?  
**[0:03:35-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:03:35):**  What made you come back to agriculture and food and switch quite drastically a career  from in the city of Amsterdam back to opening or reopening a cafe in Northern France?  Yeah, well, reopening the cafes is I think one project among many others.  
**[0:03:54-0:04:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:03:54):**  Like many entrepreneurs, I guess.  I think, you know, Patagonia was for me, a tremendous and beautiful university in a way.  I had the chance to do a job that put me in touch with all the pioneers across Europe  
**[0:04:11-0:04:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:04:11):**  when it comes to the forefront of how our society could look like by 2050.  So I really talked with amazing personalities.  And yet, I think the world of crises we live now, it needs people to do.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:04:30):**  It does not need people to only talk.  I think both are important.  And I guess I talked today, but I also tried to do and it felt for me very important to  
**[0:04:38-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:04:38):**  go back to my roots where I belong in.  I would call it underprivileged region in France and really apply everything I've learned,  everything I've seen.  
**[0:04:49-0:04:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:04:49):**  And I had the perfect soil for that.  You know, I had a house, I had a history in that village.  I have a place to create wherever I want.  
**[0:04:57-0:05:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:04:57):**  And I felt like, you know, to make the true decisions in your life, you need to leave the problems.  And if you don't leave the problem and you live in a bubble, because Amsterdam is just  an amazing city, everything is beautiful, everything is easy.  
**[0:05:11-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:05:11):**  And I was winning quite a lot of money.  So you didn't have any problems.  So the decisions you make are not so radical or are not so, you know, close to the ground,  
**[0:05:20-0:05:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:05:20):**  let's say.  And I really needed to feel that to make sure that I was not out of track.  Looking at what if most people are actually living in Europe, you know, like, Amsterdam  
**[0:05:32-0:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:05:32):**  life is not really the life of 99% of European citizens,  The default.  No.  
**[0:05:40-0:05:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:05:40):**  And when do you remember when you noticed for the first time or really saw like the  immensity of the policy, I would say issue or challenge or opportunity as well like that  gigantic elephant in a room that we avoid talking about mostly on this podcast, because  
**[0:05:57-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:05:57):**  I never see clear pathways of change.  And that's why I'm so happy to have you here.  But do you remember when you saw like, whoa, this, like, this is the elephant and the one  
**[0:06:08-0:06:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:06:08):**  we have to tackle.  Otherwise, everything else seems sort of irrelevant.  And just just a joke.  
**[0:06:14-0:06:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:06:14):**  Yeah.  Well, before joining Patagonia, I walked an entire year through Latin America with a friend  of mine, we walked.  
**[0:06:23-0:06:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:06:23):**  So 7500 kilometres, which is about 5000 miles.  So we truly walked through mostly indigenous indigenous lands, starting from Mexico and  going down to Chile, Argentina and Toulouse-Oya.  
**[0:06:36-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:06:36):**  And while walking on those indigenous lands, you actually see, you know, the backyard of  globalization.  And for me, that was kind of the analogy or the metaphor of cap system, you know, like,  
**[0:06:48-0:07:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:06:48):**  we heavily destroy ecosystems, social ecosystems and natural ecosystems, wherever we subsidies.  And then I was back, I started to work with Patagonia, starting understanding, you know,  the deep roots of what's happening.  
**[0:07:03-0:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:07:03):**  And then I came back in my village for vacation.  And I just, you know, you just take your car and you go through the landscape.  And I was like, well, that landscape is fundamentally wrong.  
**[0:07:13-0:07:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:07:13):**  You know, like, I see, I and I saw energy and agriculture at the same time.  So you only see those arable farming fields.  You don't see a tree anymore over dozens and dozens of kilometres.  
**[0:07:26-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:07:26):**  And then you see those big wind turbines in the middle of those fields, because that system,  agricultural system does not make sense anymore for farmers.  They also build or they receive a lot of subsidies to build those gigantic wind turbines.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:07:39):**  So and I was like, holy shit, that that that whole fucking thing is crooked.  There's no tree, just a big tube.  I'm sorry.  
**[0:07:47-0:07:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:07:47):**  There's, there's no tree, just a big steel wind turbine.  The forest we're creating is a forest of wind turbines.  And in the middle you have our villages and then, and then you start accumulating social  
**[0:07:58-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:07:58):**  problems that you see that those villages, they're kind of dead, socially dead and stuff.  And I was like, it doesn't make sense anymore.  Like, and, and, and because I worked in the, at Patagonia, I was also very much aware of  
**[0:08:10-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:08:10):**  all the indicators around biodiversity, climate change, and the fact that our water cycles  are totally disrupted.  And I was like, well, this is it.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:08:18):**  This is, this is happening live in front of me.  And it's not like it's been driven by those farmers, but it's been imposed by the system  to those farmers since the second world war, you know, like, and I was like, yeah, it's,  
**[0:08:30-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:08:30):**  it's really wrong.  It's, it's not working.  And, and, and my land where I come from, the social and economical value is just drying  
**[0:08:38-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:08:38):**  out.  It's just pumped by huge corporations that hold most of the added value.  They extracted from that land.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:08:46):**  It's really, you know, extractivism, they extract it and they bring it to, to their  huge company and you never see it back into our, our land and our regions.  And this is really where it started from that walk where I opened my eyes.  
**[0:08:58-0:09:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:08:58):**  I needed to go out of my system, my normal system to see it.  Then I came back, re-educated myself at Patagonia.  And when I was back in my, in my region, I was like, that's, that's just probably wrong.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:09:10):**  It doesn't, it's not going well.  And from seeing that to acting, I mean, you say we need more acting than, than talking  like what what was your pathway there?  
**[0:09:24-0:09:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:09:24):**  Like what led you to, okay, this is something, or maybe even going from total despair, like  it's, it's so wrong, but we've been doing it since the second world war.  So it's been, let's say that the tracks have been laid and it's quite a deep track.  
**[0:09:35-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:09:35):**  Like it's quite difficult to get out.  If you, if we take the Amsterdam analogy, like if you're on your bike and you're stuck  in the tram track, you're going to follow the tram for a while, unless you fall or stop  
**[0:09:46-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:09:46):**  and get out like there's, there's ended because that track is going to follow your, your tire  is going to follow that track for quite a while.  And in this case, we've been following this track for quite a bit.  
**[0:09:55-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:09:55):**  What gave you hope?  What gave you like a sense of actually something this, this is not an impossible task?  Yeah.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:10:03):**  Yeah.  A very good question.  So I think there is one example that I worked on a lot that gave me, you know, okay, this  
**[0:10:13-0:10:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:10:13):**  is what we need to do.  So, you know, Patagonia is very well known for its grassroots activism.  So, you know, bottom of approach and, and, and of course this is important, but now we  
**[0:10:23-0:10:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:10:23):**  are just running out of time in front of all the social and environmental crisis.  Like we don't have time anymore.  We need to tackle every level.  
**[0:10:32-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:10:32):**  And there is one entity that is tackling every level, which is within energy community.  So in Europe now we have a Federation called RESCU, which is for renewable energy sources  cooperatives.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:10:46):**  So and it's a different type of cooperative than, than what we have in agriculture, right?  It's citizens across Europe.  They have decided to produce their own energy and they do that by creating so-called renewable  
**[0:10:59-0:11:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:10:59):**  energy communities.  So it is a spread out all across Europe and heavily decentralized system.  And yet what those thousands of communities have done, they said, Hey, we need to federate.  
**[0:11:13-0:11:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:11:13):**  So very big difference between federating and centralizing.  They did not centralize themselves.  They still, they stay very agile, very much in their community because they produce their  
**[0:11:23-0:11:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:11:23):**  local energy.  So very small companies of couple of employees, most of them, but they said, we're going to  federate because we do the same thing all across Europe.  
**[0:11:34-0:11:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:11:34):**  They federated themselves at the European level.  They are well identifiable.  They have created a storytelling.  
**[0:11:41-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:11:41):**  We are renewable energy communities.  We produce local social economical environmental services, but we want to be recognized by  the European union.  
**[0:11:51-0:12:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:11:51):**  So they created that Federation and they basically added the numbers and they saw, they saw very  quickly that, Hey, we represent such a powerful player on the market because we service more  than a million citizens for their daily energy.  
**[0:12:07-0:12:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:12:07):**  So you see that's the perfect Alliance of heavily decentralized model, which is not  focusing money and therefore not focusing power, but it's distributing money and power  within the territories.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:12:19):**  And at the same time, they are able to represent themselves at the European level.  This is exactly the model we need for agriculture.  Right?  
**[0:12:29-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:12:29):**  So just to unpack a bit, these are groups of citizens, which could be hundreds or thousands,  depending on where you are, that then ended up building these wind turbines or building  solar parks and building local energy sources, but owning them.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:12:40):**  And instead of that extractive model, you just explained like, okay, somebody comes  in and pays a lot of subsidy or pays a lot of money to a farmer puts a huge wind turbine,  but that's it like all the local, the energy, first of all, of course is used locally, but  
**[0:12:52-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:12:52):**  isn't sold locally, meaning that everybody locally pays the enormous price.  Now we see it in this winter in Europe and we get to that in a second, but also like  if you own that wind turbine, or if you own as a community, suddenly very different things  
**[0:13:06-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:13:06):**  become possible because you first put it there and all the money and all the added value  stays there.  For sure.  
**[0:13:11-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:13:11):**  You hired a local company to do most of the work for sure.  You make sure that some of the profit goes to the local school to get buses.  I mean, all of these, these are endless stories of local communities getting together and  
**[0:13:23-0:13:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:13:23):**  own their, their energy source, which I think in this time of crisis is an absolute, like  before it was already very relevant.  And this time of crisis, it's an absolute must.  
**[0:13:32-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:13:32):**  And they got together and said, okay, actually we, we are quite a force.  We are 1 million customers where, and we should go to Brussels, which is the headquarters  of Europe and let this voice be known.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:13:43):**  And then they, did they start changing because like, was there, was there legislation change  needed and was that voice needed for something instead of just saying, Hey, look, we're here.  We serve a lot of people don't listen only to the big fossil fuel energy companies.  
**[0:13:55-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:13:55):**  Like there's actually an alternative or was there a goal of going to Brussels and change  something?  Yeah, it's exactly what they did.  
**[0:14:03-0:14:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:14:03):**  Like maybe a bit in a naive way, but they were like, well, we do represent a competitor  on the European market.  Let's not forget that European union is based on the free market.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:14:16):**  You know, European union always talk about consumers, never really citizens.  They talk about consumers.  So once you do represent a concrete, a solid competitor on the European market, you must,  
**[0:14:31-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:14:31):**  you are entitled to have a place on the market.  You are entitled to be recognized by the market and by European union.  So that's what they did.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:14:39):**  Very nightly, they said, well, we are a competitor on the European market.  We want our share from the policies you basically build right now only for mostly giants.  And what I want to say is that they are not against the giants.  
**[0:14:53-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:14:53):**  They do understand that they also have a role to play.  It's just, they really want to rebalance the, where the money goes, you know, like from  owning 99% by the giants, they say, Hey, we want our share.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:15:05):**  Like whether it's 30%, 40, 50%, they do understand they have a role to play, especially in research  and development in, in backing up when it needs, you know, when you need to make a big  investments, they have, you know, they have like the, the, the solidity to, to back up  
**[0:15:20-0:15:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:15:20):**  those investments and work together.  And you see that happening.  Of course, if you let only the giants, the giants, they always want more market shares.  
**[0:15:29-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:15:29):**  But if you have a political entity that is able to balance because they see a complimentary  system represented by citizens gathering, making something solid with good business  models, then the political, they're going to say, Hey, now the giants, you're going  
**[0:15:44-0:15:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:15:44):**  to work with those, those, those citizens that have well structured themselves that  have built more added value in their territories that are not so concentrated as you are.  And so you balance, you know, the effect of capitalism, because if you let capitalism  
**[0:15:58-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:15:58):**  go by itself, it will always focus money on one part of the system.  If you take food system, that's what's happening.  If you take energy system, that's what has happened as well.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:16:08):**  And it's just about the fighting, the normal tendency and the natural tendency of capitalism  to always focus money and therefore power.  So that's what that model of energy has done because they tend to produce local energy.  
**[0:16:24-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:16:24):**  So they create small companies and they are spread out all over our European territories.  And that's very healthy because it brings back people, it brings back jobs.  And of course it brings back social links within our communities.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:16:38):**  And so what has happened this year, like what we're in a very challenging time in terms  of energy markets and prices and, and because of the war, obviously, and gas prices have  gone through the roof and does electricity prices.  
**[0:16:52-0:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:16:52):**  And some people like suddenly energy is a thing in Europe, like with these, do you have  a sense what has happened with these energy communities?  Like if I would be a customer of an energy or a customer and a co-owner and a participant  
**[0:17:04-0:17:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:17:04):**  or whatever, maybe even investor, because in many cases they finance things through  the crowd as well.  Like what would I have noticed the difference of being a participant there compared to being  
**[0:17:14-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:17:14):**  a client or customer of one of the giants?  Well, exactly.  Well, to give you a good example, in my village, we are starting with the farmer and the mayor.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:17:27):**  We have a small group, we are starting what we call a collective auto consumption.  So we are starting to consume among each other's our own energy.  And that's a direct cuts in your energy bill because from being shaken by the inflation  
**[0:17:48-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:17:48):**  and everything, what's happening on the markets and be dependent on your energy bill from  those giants.  Well, you start consuming the energy you produce and therefore the energy is just, if you linearize  
**[0:17:59-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:17:59):**  it over a long period of time, like a couple of decades, then it's very cheap.  And so you are out of the inflation bubble because your local authorities, like for example,  the village, I decided to invest into a collective auto consumption.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:18:16):**  So you are protecting at the local level from what's happening on the market.  Just to give a bit of background for anybody listening outside Europe or depending on where  you are in Europe, but there are places where I've seen gas bills going from the same month  
**[0:18:30-0:18:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:18:30):**  last year in 2021, this year, seven times.  So this is not 5% here or 10% there, which is already a lot and could push companies  over the edge.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:18:39):**  But this is five times, seven times.  It's really an unprecedented speculation, unprecedented money making machine for some  places and unprecedented shock for many others, if you have an energy intensive company or  
**[0:18:53-0:19:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:18:53):**  household, this is a very, very, there are people that are choosing now in the UK between  eating and heating.  And that's something we've never imagined.  
**[0:19:02-0:19:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:19:02):**  Of course it was way too cheap energy until now.  And the real price, true costs, et cetera, was never part of it.  But a shock like this, I don't think anybody predicted or people predicted it, but not  
**[0:19:12-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:19:12):**  this clear.  And now suddenly energy is no longer a commodity.  It's even scarce.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:19:17):**  It's really, so these, these communities and cutting yourself mostly off or shielding yourself  from these forces that are completely out of your control are fundamental energy, but  we've seen that, I mean, now to make the bridge to, to food, it's exactly the same.  
**[0:19:32-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:19:32):**  Just what I want to say, Koen, to end up on that is this auto, this collective auto consumption  has been possible because of the work of that Federation.  The policies were not there.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:19:44):**  They implemented the policies so that we can start taking our energy future at hand.  So this is before this was illegal.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:19:53-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:19:53):**  This is concrete work they have done at the European level for every European citizen.  Of course, we don't know it because it comes from Europe and most of what's happening there.  We don't know.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:20:01):**  We don't know where it comes from, but this is a concrete example of what they have been  able to achieve to start scaling up.  And we see that now in almost every villages around me, like whether you are an ecologist  
**[0:20:13-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:20:13):**  or not, no one really cares.  Everyone understand that, Hey, I want to balance socially with my neighbors.  I want to do something that makes sense for me.  
**[0:20:24-0:20:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:20:24):**  And I want to reestablish, I want to take my future at hand.  So concrete example of what they have been able to achieve in change of policies.  And sorry, I now I'll let you go for food.  
**[0:20:34-0:20:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:20:34):**  I mean, that's an amazing example of quote unquote, very boring work that people did  in Brussels, which for sure wasn't easy and for sure wasn't fast.  And so what did you, I mean, it's a very concrete living example you're going through now, but  
**[0:20:49-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:20:49):**  so what can, what can we, the, the, the, the Royal we in, in food and ag learn from that?  First of all, that change is possible.  I think that's a, but also we see inflation prices now, input prices exploding.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:21:02):**  Like we see very similar things happening in the food space.  And so it feels like the moment is there.  What, what do we need to do?  
**[0:21:10-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:21:10):**  What are pathways on now let's start first.  Like how, how is the food system organized?  You see in France, obviously, but also in Europe and why is that such an issue and why  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:21:21):**  do we need some power rebalancing there?  And then we're going to get to pathways.  Yeah.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:21:25):**  Well, I'll give you a concrete example.  So sorry guys, but the French example as I'm back to France and I've started to really  digging into the one concrete example.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:21:33):**  So in France you have 436,000 farmers.  So let's say about a half a million farmers and everything they produce goes in an hourglass  process sold by 304 companies, basically 300 companies that are from the agro industry  
**[0:21:54-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:21:54):**  that transform and four distributors that are selling.  So from 500,000, you go to 300 and then you go to a market of 67 million people.  So it's kind of an hourglass, right?  
**[0:22:05-0:22:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:22:05):**  But it's extremely, like, it's like just imagine 400,000 because it's always difficult to seed  it like 400,000, 450,000 or five, a half a million, let's say going through 300 companies.  So we already missed three zeros there and then going for only going through it.  
**[0:22:21-0:22:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:22:21):**  That's a thousand X just for everybody listening.  And I, we should all take a pen and paper and just write that down.  So 400,000 hourglass, 400,000 on top of 440,000, 50,000, then 300 companies and then four,  
**[0:22:37-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:22:37):**  only four.  So that's a hundred thousand times reduction distributors.  And then it goes back to an even bigger part on the bottom, which is 67 million plus some  
**[0:22:47-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:22:47):**  export of course, 67 million.  So that's six zeros consumers that are just consuming and not participating.  So that's an extremely narrow hourglass, basically.  
**[0:23:00-0:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:23:00):**  It's very, you will never build it this way because it would break in half a second.  And it is breaking now, actually, it's a very nice, like pun intended, obviously.  So that's the situation in France.  
**[0:23:11-0:23:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:23:11):**  And I'm guessing it's not very different across, if you would do the European, it might differ  a bit, but not a lot.  Like it's always very concentrated around those 300 processors and four or five, six  
**[0:23:24-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:23:24):**  or two, even in many cases distributors.  We are back to a system, a capitalistic system.  We've let the natural tendency, and I'm not criticising capitalism.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:23:36):**  I think we'll come to it that I think it has a lot of efficient ways of being useful for  good.  It's just I'm saying that natural tendency is at one point in the chain, on the overall  
**[0:23:48-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:23:48):**  chain, it has focused money and therefore it has focused power because capitalism creates  huge things and those huge things then they have kind of, you know, they have the DNA  to keep on living.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:24:01):**  And so they always want to acquire more.  That's totally normal.  You know, that's a surviving mode.  
**[0:24:07-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:24:07):**  And we've let that happen just out of being precise, those four distributors that I was  talking about, they represent 92% of the market and the 300 transformers, like processing  companies, they represent 85% of the market.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:24:23):**  So what's left is nothing, you know, like the big pie, the big pie is hold by that thin  part of the hourglass.  And if we wait a few more decades, they're going to be even less because the tendency  
**[0:24:36-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:24:36):**  is 300, there will be 150 and from those four, there will be two, one, not one, probably  not because then we say competition, competition, let's keep two, just for fate.  Now imagine that at the European level, okay, you're in your offices and you need to decide,  
**[0:24:53-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:24:53):**  okay, how am I going to feed 500 million European citizens?  Well, of course you're going to go for the one that tells you, Hey, look, we are very  highly recognizable.  
**[0:25:04-0:25:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:25:04):**  We are 300 companies and you know what?  We can take care of the 500 million.  Like you know, like they have a very, we employ a lot of people.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:25:14):**  We feed, we are very efficient, you know, we're spread out all over Europe.  We can ensure you here are all the KPIs until then you don't have a complimentary system  that tells you, Hey, look, I am also able to address the European markets.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:25:34):**  I am easily identifiable.  This is the way I do until you don't have that.  Of course, politicians, they're going to go for food security.  
**[0:25:42-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:25:42):**  They're going to secure the fact that they can feed 500 million European citizens.  That's totally logic.  Just put one second yourself in their shoes.  
**[0:25:52-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:25:52):**  This is totally normal.  And back to the energy, that's what energy did.  They said, Hey, look, we are a complimentary model.  
**[0:26:01-0:26:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:26:01):**  We produce green energy.  We service right now about a million citizens across Europe.  Yes, we are decentralized.  
**[0:26:08-0:26:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:26:08):**  And so what?  We are federated.  We are well represented at European level, give us share of the market, give us policies  
**[0:26:15-0:26:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:26:15):**  that allow us to thrive.  Basically, that's what they've achieved.  But that does not exist in agriculture right now.  
**[0:26:25-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:26:25):**  I mean, I'm not going to say agriculture, I'm going to say food systems because tomorrow,  a farm that is able to, I would say, and then I think it's going to be part of the conversation  that is able to base everything organic and go beyond organic into a regenerative organic  
**[0:26:39-0:26:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:26:39):**  way.  And that is able to say, I am a profitable company that employs a couple of people or  10, 10 people, 15 people.  
**[0:26:49-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:26:49):**  And I'm processing and I'm selling at least 50% and I'm servicing, I don't know, a couple  of thousands of customers.  And imagine that type of farm times 200,000 or even 500,000 and playing the same rule  
**[0:27:04-0:27:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:27:04):**  book and being federated at the European level, suddenly hiring the same lobbyists.  Suddenly you represent a force that is credible that I can rely on because it's trustworthy,  it's efficient, it's servicing literally millions of customers.  
**[0:27:22-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:27:22):**  And I can touch it.  And so the question is, but the question is because the Federation on the energy side  served quite a lot of people had very concrete examples.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:27:32):**  And I think in region ag or region agriculture people are like, yeah, but first of all, is  it profitable?  And is it producing a lot of food?  
**[0:27:40-0:27:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:27:40):**  Like, do we have, and I know we have, but I'm asking the question to you, do we have  like enough of those strong examples that can be federated that have a track record  of feeding people employing 10, 20, 30 or five or whatever the number is, but more than  
**[0:27:54-0:28:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:27:54):**  one person and that are processing quite a bit themselves and are mostly off chemical  inputs or completely off outside inputs and are feeding a lot of people like do we have  like, is there, let's say the substrate of Federation?  
**[0:28:09-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:28:09):**  Are we are we do we have those examples?  And you're going to say yes, of course, because we did a pre call and we know each other.  But like, just for people to hear like there are enough successful examples to not just  
**[0:28:20-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:28:20):**  point at all, there's a rare exception or something.  No, this is a movement that against all odds and against all incentives have created successful  models.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:28:28):**  So yes, good.  And that's, we're done.  Like, that's been the base of my work.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:28:35):**  Together with so Université Domaine du Posib, so if we would try to do a literate translation,  it's the University of the Fields of Possible, which is a university and a farm.  And so we are a core group of this university and this farm and a couple of other farms.  
**[0:28:56-0:29:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:28:56):**  And we created, we start creating an embryo of what we want to be a European network to  federate all those pioneers.  Those pioneers, they are Superman, Batman, Catwoman, whatever you want to call them,  
**[0:29:11-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:29:11):**  because they have been just they've been it's incredible what they've achieved, because  they've put everything at stake to go against the current against the tide.  And in that model, that in that agricultural model, where the cap is pushing you towards  
**[0:29:25-0:29:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:29:25):**  one model, it's just amazing what they have succeeded at doing.  But so we want to federate those pioneers across Europe.  We want to show that whatever the number, it's not important.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:29:37):**  We want to show that it's possible.  And once this is that we have that gathering, so we've done it in France, and we keep on  doing it.  
**[0:29:46-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:29:46):**  We want to create a rule book, quite a simple one, you know, like, hey, so what are the  and then let's take a visual tour to one of the examples or one of the farms just for  people or one of the food companies because the end they are a food company exactly just  
**[0:30:00-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:30:00):**  to describe what you would see Dutch view compared to the very sad fields you described  before.  So I'll give you an example of a farm, which is part of our core group.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:30:13):**  It's called a farm, a Biot de T. It's written T H E Y.  So it's it's in France, 200 hectares, they have about 10 enterprises on the farm.  So they have guest houses, they have I don't know how many type of life.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:30:33):**  So they have livestock, they have chicken, they have market garden, they have about 50  hectares of crops that are feeding, of course, all the livestock they have on the farm.  It's an amazing model, like any external any output is an input for the other enterprise.  
**[0:30:53-0:31:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:30:53):**  And it really works as a, you know, a mix of quite a few people.  Yeah, they have a lot.  They have 12 full time employees on the farm.  
**[0:31:03-0:31:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:31:03):**  They have how do you say that in English?  They have a shop on the farm where they sell.  So remember, 200 hectare farm, they sell more than three quarters of the entire thing they  
**[0:31:15-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:31:15):**  produce meats, crops, cereals, everything they produce more than three quarter is sold  on that farm.  And the farm is in the suburb of a pretty large scale, like a couple of I think it's  
**[0:31:30-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:31:30):**  100,000 people, which is called Bezanson.  But it's a perfect example of a farm that works as an ecosystem that goes beyond organic,  that is able to process and sell most of what they produce on their farm.  
**[0:31:50-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:31:50):**  And they attract so many customers that basically are not becoming customer anymore.  You know, they educate themselves, they come on the farm, they see how it works.  They regain a link with their countryside.  
**[0:32:02-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:32:02):**  And it's fundamental.  And, and the price, by the way, the price by which they sell, because they control their  value, they control their price, like, it's not really more and I don't have a study.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:32:16):**  So I'm going to be a bit vague, but it's not more than what you find right now in supermarket.  Which is very interesting in these times, like I read an article, Pete Overly, I think  we're going to link it below on the prices of local farms like this should be the time  
**[0:32:31-0:32:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:32:31):**  with crazy inflation and crazy energy prices, obviously, like we discussed below that farms  that are mostly running on their own inputs are mostly running on not outside inputs,  and are selling direct, they like most of the raises in prices and the cost raises are  
**[0:32:47-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:32:47):**  happening outside the farm or in transport are in heating, etc, etc.  So this should be the moment and you see that with many of these farms that are their prices  are not going up as much or not even at all.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:32:58):**  And they should be out competing everybody else actually on price, of course, they have  computer quality and on all the other benefits, but even just on price, yeah, because they  don't have all the multiples of the distribution and these processing companies that use an  
**[0:33:09-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:33:09):**  incredible amount of energy and does feel this gas prices and other prices a lot and  the fertilizers.  So this is an interesting moment as well, like if they were already okay with prices  
**[0:33:20-0:33:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:33:20):**  now, of course, quality is out of the window is out of the through the roof.  Imagine now as all the other prices are just keep going up like this winter is going to  be really interesting for that.  
**[0:33:30-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:33:30):**  Another example comes to mind is La Viala, we interviewed them, of course, before over  2000 hectares, quite a lot cultivated, everything sold directly to the end consumer almost by  chance.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:33:41):**  In Tuscany, they sell most of it abroad, but all of that margin, all of that energy comes  back to the farm comes back there and employs, I think over 200 people now.  And there are these examples.  
**[0:33:53-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:33:53):**  The problem is, yeah, what you said they don't have a voice, they don't have a united they're  very busy, obviously, it's not that they have a ton of time to go to Rome or to Brussels  or to Paris to start arguing because they they literally built let's not forget, they  
**[0:34:07-0:34:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:34:07):**  build a system that shouldn't be possible.  If you look at the incentives, like it doesn't make any sense.  If you look at the current trend rails is pointed towards clearly towards one goal,  
**[0:34:18-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:34:18):**  and they went completely the other direction and build a very successful example.  But we cannot expect others to easily follow unless we change those trend tracks.  So how do we bring those individual examples?  
**[0:34:28-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:34:28):**  It is always easy to say, Oh, this is just an exception.  This is just they were lucky or they had the land and they had the money and they had the  history and blah, blah, blah, which in most cases is not true.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:34:36):**  But let's say they had it even like, how do we translate that into like a strong voice  that changes some of those incentives and some of those even take some of the bad ones  away because most of these things are being hindered by bad incentives, not even by the  
**[0:34:52-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:34:52):**  lack of good ones, but are just hindered by bad subsidies that don't make any sense.  Yeah.  So first step, you gather all those pioneers.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:35:00):**  Second step, immensely important.  When you go to European Union at the level of Europe, words are really important because  policies are written with words and each word counts.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:35:15):**  The problem within food systems is that in French, we say the fish is drowned.  I just read another report of the IUCN around sustainable agricultural, agriculture, sorry,  an approaches to sustainable agriculture.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:35:31):**  And you have more than 15 names for the different type of sustainable agriculture.  So to create a federating movement, easily recognizable to federate millions of customers  around hundreds of thousands of farm, everyone needs a way to do agriculture that is easily  
**[0:35:50-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:35:50):**  identifiable.  But if we start fighting...  So how do you do that?  
**[0:35:54-0:35:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:35:54):**  Because that's like...  Exactly.  They're going to go like, no, but it should be that.  
**[0:35:57-0:36:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:35:57):**  No, it should be included.  Exactly.  That's the key point.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:36:00):**  So how did you do it in France?  Because you have gathered this group of people, which for sure are very strong voices because  otherwise you don't build these things.  
**[0:36:08-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:36:08):**  And so how did you get them first of all, in one room?  Because they might not always like each other.  Maybe they do.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:36:12):**  But how do you get that?  Because you mentioned before, and we didn't get back to that yet, this simple rule book,  like how do you make sure it's not a 50 page with 16,000 exceptions and all of that?  
**[0:36:23-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:36:23):**  What did you do in France to gather and select the group?  Because it's a bit of a selection of, okay, you're in, you're out, or you're not there  yet, or we want a minimum, at least we want a bar, we want some kind of minimum.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:36:35):**  So first of all, I think there are two movements that need to start talking to one another.  On the one hand, you have the regenerative movement.  On the other hand, you have the agroecology movement.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:36:45):**  And those two movements, I see that they start, I would not say it's split, but they don't  really talk to one another.  And I think that's the first major thing we need to solve is that agroecology is basically  
**[0:36:59-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:36:59):**  the fact that you think about the overall food systems.  You think about what your farming practices, but you also think about the fact that you  want to keep the added value within your farm.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:37:08):**  So you process and you sell.  And then regenerative movement I see is much more focused on the practices in the farm,  like the farming practices.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:37:17):**  So those two things should talk to one another because they are complimentary and they go  very well together.  They fit under the same, I mean, regen practices, I think the umbrella is agroecology with a  
**[0:37:28-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:37:28):**  lot of added questions and answers around social, around added value, around economy,  around democracy, et cetera.  But, and then the regen practices fit perfectly underneath.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:37:40):**  Like I don't see any, and there's a lot more published actually, if you search on agroecology,  especially in France, but also in Spanish, there's a lot more than regen ag, which is  much more Americanized or Englishized.  
**[0:37:50-0:37:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:37:50):**  And then those two movements.  So we need to reconcile them and bring them together.  Then the second thing is that we need to protect them.  
**[0:37:58-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:37:58):**  Again, at the European level, you can use the word, those words, agroecology, regenerative,  it means nothing.  It literally means nothing like for you as a practitioner, as a farmer, it means a lot  
**[0:38:10-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:38:10):**  because you really believe in it.  But at the European level, it means nothing like tomorrow I can be a company and I say,  I'm a regenerative company.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:38:18):**  Who's going to check?  There's no nothing to check it.  So I was, well, we were together on a, on a Dutch farm and the farmer said, yeah, I  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:38:27):**  don't want a label.  Like no more labels.  Like there is too many labels.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:38:32):**  That's definitely true.  That's I fully understand that.  Like the problem is that at the European level, again, when you're a politician and you make  
**[0:38:39-0:38:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:38:39):**  decisions over billions of euros, you need a label.  You need to have a matrix of decisions that clearly identify you.  Sorry, it's like this.  
**[0:38:49-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:38:49):**  And if we want to build a movement, we need a couple of labels that will identify us as  a, again, heavily decentralized because we are profitable small companies represented  into the farm.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:39:01):**  The farm is the small company and we need to be federated.  So we need, we need a couple of labels.  And we do believe in our network that we start gathering in France.  
**[0:39:10-0:39:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:39:10):**  We do believe that that label should be basing everything on organic.  And I know some people will jump on that, but I can explain, I think it can, it can,  it can be for 30 minutes.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:39:22):**  We can talk about that based on organic.  And we, we then go beyond organic in a regenerative movement.  So in a regenerative spirit.  
**[0:39:32-0:39:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:39:32):**  So you base everything on something that is protecting protected, which is the AB certification.  You know, the organic certified thing in Europe, which is, which is pretty strong, but it's  just the beginning of, of, of the regeneration process.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:39:46):**  It has, it has a lot of holes.  It's far from being perfect.  And yet it has the, the, the, the good thing to exist and to be protected.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:39:54):**  And then we go towards regeneration and then regeneration is maybe, I don't know, 50 practices  for regeneration, you know, a rule book with 50 practices or a hundred, I don't care, but  it's, everything is based on organic.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:40:09):**  And then we go beyond and we do regenerative organic.  And so suddenly you have something that is protecting easily identifiable with a rule  book.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:40:17):**  And then you play within agroecology because what, what does agroecology basically mean?  It basically means that you want to take back the control over your added value and you  want to have the benefits of that added value, the economical benefit, the social and environmental  
**[0:40:33-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:40:33):**  benefits.  And what's based on organic, isn't that already, sorry to interrupt, like protected enough  in and has a voice in Europe.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:40:42):**  Like there must be an organic lobby in Brussels, or there must be an organic lobby in Paris.  Like what is needed because it hasn't changed anything.  It seems it has not changed anything because I talked with a deputy at the European level  
**[0:40:57-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:40:57):**  and he basically says the whole game of, I will call it the other part, wherever it means  is always to put you as a niche, as something for privileged, rich people.  So basically something that is never addressing the big market, the 500 million European citizens.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:41:12):**  We need to counter that.  And how do we counter that by again, back to the energy analogy, basically say that  we service more than we service a market of multiple millions of customers every day.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:41:27):**  Is there like an interesting one in the one in France, you've gathered some of the data,  some of the company and the food company and farm you just mentioned, like in terms of,  is there an argument to make like, look, these on average, first of all, employ more people,  
**[0:41:42-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:41:42):**  per hectare or per and second feed more people, or there's more food being producer.  Is that something we can say?  Because then suddenly the argument of, Oh, if we go to these niche people, we will all  
**[0:41:52-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:41:52):**  starve because that's sort of the underlying, like there was a research coming out of Aachening  and university obviously heavily sponsored by input companies.  If we go organic, we all starve.  
**[0:42:01-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:42:01):**  Basically it was the headline more or less.  Like, is there an argument to make because you say 20 enterprises on top of the same  200 hectares.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:42:08):**  There must be an amount of food created there and process and of all the added value and  amount of jobs, like 12 people full time, well paid for sure is way more than the average  farmer with 200 hectares or the average four farms with 50 hectares.  
**[0:42:23-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:42:23):**  Those are arguments like the jobs, the food, and of course the health part, but it will  get to at some point.  Is that something we can start arguing, like saying, like, actually, actually we produce  
**[0:42:34-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:42:34):**  more food in this way, or actually we employ a lot more people.  Is that something you've seen like with this group now of the pioneers in France that you've  been gathering that have a certain size, because it's important to mention as well, of course,  
**[0:42:45-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:42:45):**  the one hectare market gardens that feed quite a few people and are small, but you're talking  actually about a certain dimension and a certain acreage and a certain scale to make that voice  known.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:42:58):**  Like, have you seen things there or is that, are we too premature, let's say to start talking  about calories per hectare or food per hectare?  No, so we start gathering the data and we start by the two important things that politicians  
**[0:43:11-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:43:11):**  want to hear.  Of course, let's talk about two things that politicians want to hear because otherwise  we can talk about our economy.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:43:16):**  Green economy and jobs in my territories.  And that's what those farms they produce, like they produce green economy.  One thing very important, and I'll go back to your question, Kouna, I think it's part  
**[0:43:30-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:43:30):**  of the answer, is that because you go beyond organic, so you don't put any input, let's  say like I make a bit the perfect world, you don't put anything, no inputs at all.  What is your economical success based on?  
**[0:43:47-0:44:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:43:47):**  Well, it's based on the health of your ecosystem.  Like if you have a bad health ecosystem, you won't produce, you won't have results.  So you need a very good, healthy ecosystem or let's call it agro ecosystem to produce  
**[0:44:00-0:44:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:44:00):**  a lot.  So how much of a regenerative economy is that?  You know, it's amazing.  
**[0:44:07-0:44:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:44:07):**  It's incredible because your economical success, they depend on your ecosystem success.  So this is the best way to recreate a regenerative economy.  Like cutting inputs.  
**[0:44:19-0:44:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:44:19):**  This is amazing.  And when you look at those farms, well, 200 hectares, 12 full-time employees producing  and servicing.  
**[0:44:27-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:44:27):**  I don't know how many customers in that shop they have on the farm.  I could ask Michelle and Evelyn, they are the creator of that amazing, I would not even  call it a farm.  
**[0:44:37-0:44:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:44:37):**  I would call it a company or whatever you want to call it.  System.  Yeah.  
**[0:44:42-0:44:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:44:42):**  So it would be super interesting for politicians to come in that farm so that they can see  what it can represent.  And again, we want to start gathering all of those.  
**[0:44:52-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:44:52):**  So you're saying green economy and jobs.  And if you start telling those politicians at again, at a scalable level, because 500  million citizens to be fed, remember that you start seeing that, Hey, look, we are right  
**[0:45:07-0:45:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:45:07):**  now, maybe in Europe, we are 10,000 farms.  Tomorrow, if you give us X percent of the cap and at the same time, if the investors,  they give us a billion Euro, then we can be surely a farm needs about seven years, seven  
**[0:45:23-0:45:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:45:23):**  to 10 years to really transform itself up, which basically right now is impossible.  You need to be a Maverick and the Maverick we gather them right now.  But let's say then within 10 years, we have 200,000 farms like this, or 500,000 farms.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:45:36):**  And we ensure that they are going to service 20 million customers.  Which is massive.  Just like as a transition plan.  
**[0:45:44-0:46:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:45:44):**  Green economy and jobs, because remember as well that European union is proudly advertising  for the green new deal, but those are just objectives.  They're not binded within policies right now because they don't have a stakeholder that  
**[0:46:01-0:46:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:46:01):**  is able to answer that.  But remember what I just told you.  Those are the questions being asked by the European commission, European movement.  
**[0:46:08-0:46:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:46:08):**  And basically it's a question to this movement.  Like, okay, we have these, the green new deal, but we need answers.  We don't have answers unless we put an answer on the table there or multiple answers.  
**[0:46:19-0:46:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:46:19):**  The answers will come from quote unquote, this is at the other side, which is going  to push for heavily input dependent, slightly more efficient, slightly cleaner climate smart,  blah, blah, blah, precision ag, all this nonsense.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:46:32):**  And so we need to put an answer on the right table at the right table.  It needs to be a solid answer.  And the answer is I am a farm, which economical success, which is proven because I exist because  
**[0:46:43-0:46:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:46:43):**  I have 12 employees.  I have 200 hectares.  I have paid my bills and everything.  
**[0:46:48-0:47:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:46:48):**  And I paid the bills of my employees.  The answer is that farm, because it goes beyond organic, it needs a very livable, vivid ecosystem.  Suddenly the prosperity of that farm is linked to the prosperity of its natural ecosystem.  
**[0:47:04-0:47:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:47:04):**  You answer green new deal.  That's it.  You don't enter green new deal.  
**[0:47:08-0:47:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:47:08):**  And I just want one key number is that 75% of overall degradation of biodiversity is  linked to our food system.  So if you start and it's one of the major green new deal objective is to really reduce  
**[0:47:23-0:47:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:47:23):**  that pressure on biodiversity.  And for that, there is no other option that transform heavily our food system and therefore  transform our farms.  
**[0:47:32-0:47:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:47:32):**  So let's give those pioneers a way to convert other farms.  And that's the whole thing about our network right now is that our network is gathering  the pioneers.  
**[0:47:43-0:47:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:47:43):**  And as pioneers, I say we, because I'm part, I'm not a farmer myself, but I'm part of the  building of that network.  We go to each farm that has a willingness and we, those pioneers that they've gone through  
**[0:47:54-0:48:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:47:54):**  so much shit, so much problems, so much things that did not go right and have corrected and  they keep on going.  And we just coach, we coach every farmer that has a willingness to change.  
**[0:48:06-0:48:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:48:06):**  And that's the key thing, right?  Right.  Like you have a coaching team that are farmers, so peer to peer, and that is coaching a farmer  
**[0:48:16-0:48:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:48:16):**  on the long run over seven years.  And now we need the money because the money does not exist.  And it's, it's, it's just like 0.5 or 1% of the farmers that because of their strong values,  
**[0:48:27-0:48:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:48:27):**  they will go through the whole tide against the tide to convert their farm.  But imagine tomorrow you have a longterm support from the markets, investors and the cap.  Then those pioneers that will be able to, to, to coach all those farmers to transform  
**[0:48:43-0:48:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:48:43):**  the system.  So basically saying, let's say this farmer we mentioned before, Michel and I forgot the  other name, but the 200 Hector is the perfect example.  
**[0:48:52-0:49:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:48:52):**  One of these examples, like the question is, how do we enable them to coach and work with  10 others around them?  Another 200 Hector, one or 2000 Hector's and another one.  
**[0:49:01-0:49:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:49:01):**  And how do we make sure they are, of course, the farm needs to keep running, but they have  unique knowledge and unique skills that are quote unquote, a waste only on their farm  because it's limiting their potential of impact.  
**[0:49:15-0:49:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:49:15):**  And what you're saying, we want to enable a system around them, a support system and  an enabler that they can enable all their neighbors to transition or the landscape or  as many neighbors as they want to, because they are able to do it.  
**[0:49:27-0:49:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:49:27):**  We've seen it.  It's, it's repeatable.  We've seen it in Labiala actually in Tuscany that their neighbors of course always called  
**[0:49:32-0:49:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:49:32):**  them crazy.  And now they're helping them transition and potentially partly selling through their platform,  not always, but helping also just curating more buffers around them and making sure their  
**[0:49:41-0:49:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:49:41):**  neighbors are not spraying.  It's also interesting for, for your ecosystem, which are completely, as you mentioned a couple  of times, depend on when you grow in this way.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:49:48):**  So there's this, but how do you enable them?  And you saying money, of course, the cup has to change.  So we need to federalize.  
**[0:49:55-0:50:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:49:55):**  You're finding enough examples here in France, you're saying 10,000 farmers, is that like  a number you came up with?  Or that's a reasonable guess in Europe, you say there are around 10,000 of these serious  
**[0:50:07-0:50:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:50:07):**  farms or it's a number you just mentioned, like are there because that's a, that's a  big number.  I tend to be, I tend to be optimistic.  
**[0:50:16-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:50:16):**  But I think it is, it is happening.  It is happening.  It's just that right now, again, the fish is drowned in too many names, like, like,  
**[0:50:26-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:50:26):**  just in my region, because I scanned in my local region, I see at least 10 farms like  this.  It's just, they don't use the name.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:50:34):**  They don't use those couple of labels that are necessary so that we can federate and  go there, but they do exist.  And the interesting thing is that you have the one Hector Maccadarden and most of the  
**[0:50:44-0:50:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:50:44):**  time they cooperate with a bigger farm.  And so together they start creating more added value.  And that's basically agroecology on a territory.  
**[0:50:52-0:51:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:50:52):**  You have multiple farms that one input of a farm is an output of another and they collaborate  with one another and you could consider them as only one system.  And have you like brought together this group in France and have you already interacted  
**[0:51:06-0:51:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:51:06):**  with policy or with politicians, let's say in regions or in Paris, like has there been  any kind of conversation and if so, not yet.  Okay.  
**[0:51:16-0:51:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:51:16):**  We have to come back to this because I'm fascinated about the response to people when they see,  look, these are, this is serious.  We want to be a peer to peer farming experience.  
**[0:51:27-0:51:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:51:27):**  But the thing that we start seeing is that the cap right now is not going to change quickly  enough.  It's a too tight system.  
**[0:51:36-0:51:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:51:36):**  And we need the help of the market because the market to invest in a farm, like let's  say it invests just in a farm because this farm is now a food company, right?  I think it's an important processing.  
**[0:51:48-0:52:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:51:48):**  It's selling is much more than a farm.  So I invest in a food company, which is actually a farm, but you need to trust the farmer.  Like, you know, any VC fund, they don't really invest in the ID of the team.  
**[0:52:01-0:52:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:52:01):**  They invest in the team themselves itself.  Right.  And you trust the team because the team has been doing Harvard or Stanford or whatever  
**[0:52:10-0:52:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:52:10):**  polytechnic in France, whatever, you know, and we need that same entrepreneurial thing  within farming, but who's going to vet for the quality of the education.  Let's call it like this of the farmer.  
**[0:52:22-0:52:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:52:22):**  What we think that our network can play that role because we've gathered the pioneer, which  are the experts.  I want those experts to be paid.  
**[0:52:30-0:52:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:52:30):**  That's the first thing farmers have been.  Again, we're back to we've extracted the value of the farmers.  So for many decades, but those farmers are the experts, you know, they've tested so many  
**[0:52:41-0:52:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:52:41):**  things that they've done underground experimentation that have worked.  They are the expert.  They need to be paid for that expertise.  
**[0:52:48-0:53:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:52:48):**  Right.  And if they are paid for that expertise and they can transmit the knowledge to all those  farmers, then we can put a vetting thing saying we've helped that farmer for two years and  
**[0:53:00-0:53:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:53:00):**  we are sure we've gathered and told him everything he needs to know to transform his farm.  He's a good entrepreneur that we can trust.  Hey, VC fund or whoever wants to give him money.  
**[0:53:16-0:53:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:53:16):**  We ensured that this is going to work.  Of course, there's still a risk.  There's VC funds.  
**[0:53:24-0:53:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:53:24):**  So your work now is okay, how do we make them quote unquote, almost not almost make them  investable, make these food companies, let's keep calling them food ecosystems and value  creation.  
**[0:53:40-0:53:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:53:40):**  It happened to be based on a farm because of course they have to.  But they're good businesses and they're investable businesses and they can grow and scale and  invest more in processing and does increase their margins, invest more in their shop,  
**[0:53:55-0:54:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:53:55):**  freezing, whatever, and invest in more hectares, in more acreage or start working with more  neighbors and it's a scalable business.  Maybe not Instagram scalable, but it's definitely a scalable business model.  
**[0:54:07-0:54:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:54:07):**  Exactly.  And the important thing is that also as a funder, you will have to change a bit your  matrix of decision, like the time, but also the fact that you're going to put less money  
**[0:54:18-0:54:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:54:18):**  but in more companies because those companies, again, you don't want to create the same problems  that have led us to so much social and environmental crisis by creating those monsters, right?  Those gigantic things.  
**[0:54:30-0:54:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:54:30):**  The thing is that if you want not only to make profitable companies and at the same  time do not ruin your social and environmental ecosystem, you need again, hundreds of thousands  of food companies spread out all over European territories.  
**[0:54:46-0:54:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:54:46):**  You will need to invest in maybe thousands of those farms.  So the way you will manage your investments is going to be more complex, but it's going  to be healthy and you will have return on investments, not only on your money, but also  
**[0:54:58-0:55:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:54:58):**  on social and environmental KPIs, which by the way, in funds and investments become also  predominant more and more.  So it's just, you will need to adapt your matrix of decisions.  
**[0:55:08-0:55:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:55:08):**  It's going to be more complex, but that's okay, right?  Like we have technology to manage complexity now.  And so you also need to change, like, it's not like I'm going to put in three startups  
**[0:55:20-0:55:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:55:20):**  that are going to grow to 500,000 people in five years.  No, I'm going to invest in a farm, which has 200 hectares.  And that number of hectares is also limiting, of course, the number of cows and everything,  
**[0:55:33-0:55:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:55:33):**  because it's based on only grasslands, but also the number of employees, right?  Like you won't build something that will be 300 employees.  1000 people.  
**[0:55:42-0:55:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:55:42):**  Yeah, no, it's going to be very healthy.  Like it's small entities, very agile, very resilient, that do not require external inputs.  So it's in a way it's very safe as well.  
**[0:55:54-0:56:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:55:54):**  Your investment is in safe hands.  Because also the counter question is there like in the energy movement you've been following  and studying and participating as well from Patagonia to like, is there a role for these  
**[0:56:10-0:56:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:56:10):**  larger outside investors, or because I've seen many of those actually tapping into the  crowd and tapping into because it's not that you need 500 million, it's not that you need  a lot of times 2 million, 5 million, 10 million, maybe, maybe 20.  
**[0:56:27-0:56:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:56:27):**  And there are especially these kind of farms you mentioned, especially ones with a history,  they have a very large network of people with money, maybe not people with 50 million, but  people with considerable wealth with a bit of wealth that are more than happy to put  
**[0:56:43-0:56:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:56:43):**  that to work for an interesting return locally in the food company they also buy from like,  is there or is there also a balancing act there, like we discussed before, like the  giants are the investors, and they would love to do stuff in the space.  
**[0:56:55-0:57:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:56:55):**  I mean, that's why hopefully many are listening to this this show and also are getting interested  in regeneration.  But at the same time, there's the consumer, which could become investor, which now only  
**[0:57:06-0:57:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:57:06):**  is limited to invest in renewable energy, which is great, not saying we shouldn't.  But I would love as a as a participant of the food system to also invest in way more  transitions of the food and I can't like what's the role of the crowd investing?  
**[0:57:18-0:57:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:57:18):**  I'm not saying crowdfunding, but specifically investing here.  Do you see many of these food companies actually just saying, yeah, of course, giant investor,  if you want to, you can play by these rules, but actually, we can get it funded ourselves  
**[0:57:29-0:57:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:57:29):**  if we want.  Yeah, exactly.  No, I think it's a it's a very important thing that you raise.  
**[0:57:34-0:57:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:57:34):**  And we start seeing a couple of initiatives here.  I speak in France, you see companies starting to I mean, companies like I would almost say  non for profit companies are very 21st century non-extractive companies type governance.  
**[0:57:49-0:58:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:57:49):**  They say like, I want to take the the resources of citizens they basically have in banks and  are doing nothing with it.  And I want to funnel it into the agricultural transformation that we need.  
**[0:58:01-0:58:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:58:01):**  And so that that that money is going to is going to be very important.  And I talked to one of that company.  And their key point is, well, you know, the only thing is that we need to trust the farmer  
**[0:58:11-0:58:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:58:11):**  that that that is going to is going to start a new farm.  It comes back to your point.  It's coming back to my part.  
**[0:58:17-0:58:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:58:17):**  It comes back to the point that right now to give expertise and training to those new  farmers from the pioneers, that system is not there is there is there is no money in  there.  
**[0:58:30-0:58:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:58:30):**  So the pioneer that needs to run his farm is not paid for that huge expertise is going  to bring to the farmers, but also to societies.  So you're building a business or a movement that will be sort of helping the investors  
**[0:58:47-0:58:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:58:47):**  and the platforms to funnel money there.  And by helping them, I'm putting words in your mouth.  So please correct.  
**[0:58:53-0:59:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:58:53):**  Yeah, like getting paid for that.  And with that money, you'll be able to pay the coaches, the pioneers willing to coach  others, but of course, don't have time to do that for free or nothing and run courses.  
**[0:59:04-0:59:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:59:04):**  And like, how do you and there's there's need for an enabler there to unlock this this huge  knowledge and to get paid for that knowledge, because that's the but there you say actually,  there's money for that because investors want to get into the space investors large and  
**[0:59:17-0:59:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:59:17):**  small want to get into it and need some kind of diligence fee and costs because they have  no clue if this farmer with a pretty spreadsheet is better than this other farmer with a pretty  spreadsheet or pretty presentation.  
**[0:59:28-0:59:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:59:28):**  Exactly.  And I'll give you an example.  Valentine Deganet, who is part of our core group in the network, she started agroecology  
**[0:59:39-0:59:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:59:39):**  school in Paris.  First we call it lissé agri-col in French with first school to be open for decades,  based fully on agroecology.  
**[0:59:51-1:00:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=0:59:51):**  She doesn't find any funds for that.  Like they're like, she's totally blocked and she needs she needs funds to train the new  generation of farmers to build farms, which is everything we just talked about, you know,  
**[1:00:03-1:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:00:03):**  so that then we can federate and go to European Union.  So there is a we needed to start investing in the farmers themselves.  And either we do it through new type of schools to train farmers.  
**[1:00:18-1:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:00:18):**  Or even better, because they are such entrepreneurs already, like we just create the peer to peer.  But this peer to peer needs to be the pioneers, they need to find economic sense because in  everything they do, there is economic sense.  
**[1:00:33-1:00:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:00:33):**  So they need to be paid for their expertise to transmit them to all the farmers that have  a willingness to transform.  And then of course, we will go find the funds for each farm to be transformed within seven  
**[1:00:42-1:00:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:00:42):**  to 10 years.  But the base is that the pioneers feel safe because I am paid for that I am paid for everything  I'm going to give to all the week I'm doing this and I'm paid well for it because I spent  
**[1:00:54-1:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:00:54):**  40 years of learning.  Yeah.  And that process ensures like risk management for the investors tomorrow when you will invest  
**[1:01:01-1:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:01:01):**  in the farmer that has been trained, because then suddenly the risk is just way lower because  that investor or politicians they know that the farmer is constantly helped by a network  of pioneers that that within a day is giving experience of maybe decades, you know.  
**[1:01:23-1:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:01:23):**  And that has a price.  I have already said it would be great.  It has a price and would be as an investor, you would sit next to Richard Perkins or Joel  
**[1:01:31-1:01:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:01:31):**  Salatin.  I'm not sure if they are most commercial success, but like successful agro-quality farmer and  just see who comes through the gates there, who works there and who goes out and start  
**[1:01:41-1:01:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:01:41):**  or who calls them and say, can you help?  But of course there's a missing piece there you have to fund and pay the successful one  to work with the others and to enable them to work with the others.  
**[1:01:53-1:02:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:01:53):**  And then actually, but it's a simple quote unquote due diligence cost that you would  normally pay anyway.  But just if he or she like the successful agro-quality farmer says, this one is real,  
**[1:02:02-1:02:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:02:02):**  this is a real deal.  Like I would love to work with XYZ and my distant neighbor because they really understand  they've done the groundwork.  
**[1:02:10-1:02:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:02:10):**  Then as an investor, that cost of paying the agro-quality expert to work with them is a  very small thing compared to the investment you're making anyway.  It's a proof of, the due diligence cost there are, if you do enough of them are absolutely  
**[1:02:26-1:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:02:26):**  negligible, but you have to trust the agro-quality expert and the one who has done the 40 years  of work to really know his or her work.  Obviously, I mean, you can see the example.  
**[1:02:37-1:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:02:37):**  It's a very interesting, different model for as an investor, but it makes a lot of sense.  And I think it, I mean, I don't know if you run the numbers, but as a model, it makes  absolute sense from an investor point of view.  
**[1:02:48-1:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:02:48):**  Yeah, I think it does.  I think it really does.  So what would you do with a billion euros?  
**[1:02:53-1:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:02:53):**  Let's say tomorrow or tonight we record this podcast goes live and you suddenly wake up  with almost unlimited money in your bank account to invest.  Let's get to it.  
**[1:03:04-1:03:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:03:04):**  So if you're investing in investment, you can put some of it to policy because I consider  that honestly an investment as well.  But what would you do if you had a billion euros with this inflation numbers might, we  
**[1:03:14-1:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:03:14):**  might have to add a few zeros, but let's say a billion years is still a lot of money when  this comes out.  What would you do with that if you had to put it to work?  
**[1:03:21-1:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:03:21):**  I think that the first thing I would do is that every pioneer we've gathered so far,  I'll make sure that their farm runs well.  So maybe they need to employ someone to manage the farm or whatever, you know, and then free  
**[1:03:32-1:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:03:32):**  some time from those pioneers because they are an, an infinite source of value for future  of food systems.  I gathered them and I tell them, no guys, with this billion, we're going to go farmer  
**[1:03:46-1:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:03:46):**  by farmer.  We're going to identify how they want to transform their model.  And you're going to give me the business case, like for each farm, seven to 10 years, what  
**[1:03:54-1:04:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:03:54):**  it takes for them to be under regenerative organic practices and sell at least 50%.  And we do that, we start by checking, just selling at least 50% locally, meaning from  the farm and not in global food systems.  
**[1:04:08-1:04:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:04:08):**  So that's, those are the two big ones for you.  Regen organic in X years and selling at least 50% directly, let's say.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:04:19-1:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:04:19):**  That's it.  Let's call it like this because again, because those two things will help you to transform  the cap also, you know, it's, it's about federating at the European level and we need to play  
**[1:04:28-1:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:04:28):**  among a rule book that is clearly identifiable.  But in any way, those pioneers, then I gathered them every hour they spend the counseling  and giving advices to the farmers.  
**[1:04:37-1:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:04:37):**  I pay them well, I pay them well.  And then we build business case, farm by farm, and we follow them over the course of their  overall transformation over seven years.  
**[1:04:49-1:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:04:49):**  And we start and we start like doing maybe, I don't know, like you give me a billion.  So I'd say in 10,000 farm, I invest a hundred thousand Euro or something like that.  And then we convert 10,000 farms.  
**[1:05:02-1:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:05:02):**  And then once we have that, then we have a Federation, we go to Europe and then we covered  the real big money.  Then we convert the cap, which is 400 billion over the course of seven years.  
**[1:05:14-1:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:05:14):**  Just to get, let's say again, 400 billion in seven years.  And I would say 99% goes to, or 95, whatever the number is way too much goes to non-ex,  so you say we have to build a movement, even the amount of pioneers we have now is not  
**[1:05:28-1:05:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:05:28):**  enough yet to be strong enough.  So we have to free up the time, pay the time of these pioneers.  So the best thing investors could do is pay the pioneers to work with others and to invest  
**[1:05:40-1:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:05:40):**  in the others to transition.  That's what they are basically saying.  Yeah, exactly.  
**[1:05:43-1:05:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:05:43):**  So the pioneers, let's say someone invest in those pioneers, really give them the time.  And then those pioneers, they identify the first hundred farms, they make the business  case, it works.  
**[1:05:53-1:06:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:05:53):**  And then the investors say, I'm fully interested, let's go for those hundred first.  And then they build something over the next seven, 10 years.  And then we make, you know, you have a percentage of 75% success or whatever, you know, we try  
**[1:06:09-1:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:06:09):**  managing risks.  And then we start like by iteration loops, we start having a very good rule book and  we start knowing like, there might be a process that we can a bit duplicate.  
**[1:06:21-1:06:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:06:21):**  And while you do that, you never go into the negative side of capitalism.  You never want to create a big machine.  You always want to create small, resilient food companies, which are farms, right?  
**[1:06:35-1:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:06:35):**  It is key because otherwise you keep on just building a new problem.  Like the solution is the decentralization of the money, like keeping the money within  the farm, which now are food companies, keeping the money in those farms, which act in their  
**[1:06:49-1:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:06:49):**  territories are able to, in a very agile way, adapt to their own context.  I was talking to a regenerative farmer right before us, and he was saying, you know, there  is always the problem.  
**[1:07:00-1:07:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:07:00):**  Once you start going regenerative and organic, like everything you apply on one farm is not  really always going to work on the other.  And this is where you need the help of pioneers because the pioneers are going to manage the  
**[1:07:13-1:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:07:13):**  risk of everything they have seen, everything they've built themselves.  They're going to say this, whatever the context might work.  And then because I'm super agile, I've been doing that for 40 years every day.  
**[1:07:25-1:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:07:25):**  Between science and consciousness, I've always worked between those two things.  I'm going to help you, you know, and this is the best risk management ever.  And just to be, to double click on small, like we're not meaning a mom and pop homestead  
**[1:07:42-1:07:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:07:42):**  farm that eats everything they produce.  Like small, I mean, 200 hectares might sound small, depending where you are.  If you're in Australia, small, this is very, very small, but these are actually medium  
**[1:07:53-1:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:07:53):**  sized businesses, medium sized food businesses that employ 10, 20, 50, 100, whatever the  number is, that process that have machines that this is a considerable company, but they're  not a unity.  
**[1:08:04-1:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:08:04):**  Like these are a medium sized or small to medium sized businesses that could employ  quite a few people.  And of course, we have to repeat it, but it's not a small, like one family runs everything  
**[1:08:13-1:08:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:08:13):**  and they're with two people and constantly, like these are companies, these are, we have  to treat them really as food companies in part of an ecosystem, which happens to be  a farm and thus they could be investable and could grow and scale and then repeat it and  
**[1:08:29-1:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:08:29):**  replicate it, et cetera.  But small is just to compare it to the Cargill's, you know, Leaver's and massive companies.  The new scalability is you investing in maybe thousands of food companies slash farms.  
**[1:08:46-1:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:08:46):**  I like the fact that you said that.  And stackability, I mean, if you say 20 enterprises on the same land, that's scale, but it's scale  up, not scale wide.  
**[1:08:55-1:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:08:55):**  And that's very counterintuitive, I think for many investors, until you see it, like  all these hidden efficiencies that are there when you run all of these enterprises on the  same land, which is still quite big, 200 hectares is not small at all.  
**[1:09:11-1:09:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:09:11):**  But there's space, there's still space for more enterprises on it.  And at some point, some of these enterprises start working with neighboring land as well  and it's spreading.  
**[1:09:19-1:09:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:09:19):**  So it's small, but it's definitely not small.  It's like, there's an interesting tension there you need to explore and get comfortable  with running it as a company.  
**[1:09:27-1:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:09:27):**  Like this is a company that pays bills, pays employees, pays pension costs.  Like this is not processed stuff, not in a kitchen, but in a professionally clean, certified  kitchen, staff processing units.  
**[1:09:38-1:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:09:38):**  This is real food and real business.  And you answer really the three pillars, social, environmental and economical.  So again, it is really that system that I took from energy and we try here to apply  
**[1:09:56-1:10:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:09:56):**  to agriculture, that system is smart because it really, again, I can only insist and emphasize  that it's not anymore 300 companies holding 95% of the value.  It is 300,000, a million or whatever food companies giving money in their territories  
**[1:10:16-1:10:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:10:16):**  to everyone.  So if you are really true to your social and environmental goals on top of having a healthy  economy or regenerative one, this is the way to go.  
**[1:10:27-1:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:10:27):**  There is no other way because we see it for the past 70 years.  Like the more you concentrate, the more you create problems and you need to rely on the  capacity of the farmer to act between science, consciousness, like his consciousness, his  
**[1:10:41-1:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:10:41):**  wiseness, science.  And again, the fundamental thing is that their prosperity is based on the prosperity of their  natural ecosystem.  
**[1:10:53-1:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:10:53):**  And I think that's why it's the best regenerative economy we can think of.  Like you work with the land, that land is, if you take care of it, you will take care  of us.  
**[1:11:06-1:11:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:11:06):**  Really it will.  So I really believe in that system, but it definitely changed, needs a switch in our  way to invest and trust the pioneers.  
**[1:11:18-1:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:11:18):**  That point on the pioneers, like how repeatable is it in a sense?  What if these pioneers of course, against all odds, super entrepreneurial, but are maybe  the 1% or the 1% exception that are, because they're most of all of it, like is this teachable  
**[1:11:35-1:11:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:11:35):**  and is this, can we expect that others will be not as entrepreneurial, but entrepreneurial  enough to start processing companies on their farms, start selling directly to a certain  extent.  
**[1:11:49-1:12:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:11:49):**  And there are a lot of trades that like in society in general, I think that the research  suggests 15%, one five is very entrepreneurial and will build businesses, et cetera.  Like, do we have enough entrepreneurial farmers that with the right coaching can make these  
**[1:12:05-1:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:12:05):**  big steps?  Because it's a massive thing going from very input, but also very recipe driven.  Like I'm selling to the same cooperative, I'm buying the seeds and the input and the  
**[1:12:14-1:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:12:14):**  pesticides and the herbicides and the agronomic advisor comes from the same cooperative as  well.  And that's what I'm doing.  
**[1:12:20-1:12:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:12:20):**  And I'm not making a lot of money.  I'm very stressed and I'm on my tractor, especially in the summer until midnight very often, but  at least I'm, I don't have to make so many decisions because maybe I don't want to or  
**[1:12:30-1:12:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:12:30):**  I'm not able.  Like, is there enough entrepreneurial capacity in the farmers to replicate this?  Yeah.  
**[1:12:39-1:12:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:12:39):**  Well, I don't have the numbers whatsoever.  But I can tell you that only just for example, the farmer in my village, the guy is conventional,  but he sees that anyway, his ecosystem is just dying.  
**[1:12:54-1:13:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:12:54):**  He tries to put a bit of nothing and doing a bit of different rotations and stuff, but  he sees that it's not enough.  So whether they want it or not, it's coming also to an end.  
**[1:13:04-1:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:13:04):**  And it's also coming to an end because synthetic fertilizers are just going to roof in terms  of prices and all the other things.  So I think that will be forced.  
**[1:13:15-1:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:13:15):**  But also I think that genuinely farmers, they just love what they do and they love their  lands and their terroir.  And therefore it's not that I want to, again, it's not that I want to convert anyone and  
**[1:13:30-1:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:13:30):**  nor am I fighting against something.  It's just, I'm like, I'm here and I say, I think there is quite a substantial percentage  of farmers that are interested in another model that can be very much complimentary  
**[1:13:43-1:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:13:43):**  to the model we have right now.  And over the course of the next 10 years, let's identify the one that actually answers  best all our problems.  
**[1:13:52-1:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:13:52):**  Like that's it.  I'm really not against anything.  I think like we can really work all together and it's really about, and I don't want to  
**[1:14:01-1:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:14:01):**  create an alternative model and be put in a niche.  I want to show that, Hey guys, I'm actually pretty massive.  It's just the way you understand massive is not the same way.  
**[1:14:11-1:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:14:11):**  Me and massive because I represent with our Federation at European level, we represent  500,000 farmers, each of them employing five to 15 people servicing each farm, 500 customers.  But if you start adding up the numbers, that's quite a lot.  
**[1:14:29-1:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:14:29):**  So it's just about reinventing what massification and scalability also means.  And I'm a hundred percent sure that many farmers are ready for that journey.  It's just, it's just like when one third of the total European budgets pushes you so much  
**[1:14:47-1:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:14:47):**  in the tide that that way it's impossible for you alone in your small farm with so many  problems already to transform.  Right?  
**[1:14:55-1:15:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:14:55):**  Like, of course you don't even have time to think whether you want to be an entrepreneur  or not.  Like it's impossible.  
**[1:15:00-1:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:15:00):**  You have so much thing to deal with.  And that's why the first thing is the pioneers will come and help.  Like you keep on running your business as you do, and we'll run the numbers, we'll run  
**[1:15:12-1:15:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:15:12):**  with our expertise, our pioneering, and we'll start showing you that there is a path forward.  And I think that's, that's what's needed.  But again, those pioneers, they also, they cannot do that just for free.  
**[1:15:26-1:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:15:26):**  Too long farmers have not been paid for their expertise.  They need, they are the first expert because they work on the ground and they need to be  recognized for that.  
**[1:15:35-1:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:15:35):**  No, absolutely.  I think it's a really good way to end this conversation.  But I want to ask one more question, which usually leads to more questions.  
**[1:15:45-1:15:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:15:45):**  So what if you had, it's the magic wand question.  If you had a magic wand and you could change one thing overnight in honestly the food and  agriculture system globally, it could be something else as well.  
**[1:15:56-1:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:15:56):**  We've been talking about Europe mostly the whole time, but maybe it's something completely  different.  If you could change one thing, but one thing only overnight, what would that be?  
**[1:16:06-1:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:16:06):**  I'm looking in the food system and I'm like, I think  I think it would be to make sure regenerative and agroecology are binding together and find  a way to protect their spirit.  
**[1:16:30-1:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:16:30):**  And by that I mean their practices.  That's not so ambitious.  It could, it could be more of a, it could be abolishing all subsidies or it could be  
**[1:16:35-1:16:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:16:35):**  better taste.  It could be very dreamy if you want to, but very concrete.  I like the answer because I think it's a fundamental one.  
**[1:16:43-1:17:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:16:43):**  I think the most important for me is to say that our farm tomorrow in our farm, I'd say  50% of citizens should be part of the production of their food because then they would understand  meaning of the shops of producing their food.  
**[1:17:04-1:17:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:17:04):**  Because then I think they would understand that would, they would link, they would link  back with the ecosystems and they would see how dramatically degraded they are.  And from there on that deep link would tell them that whatever the walls in front of us,  
**[1:17:21-1:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:17:21):**  we need to act because that deep connection with ecosystems is what we miss.  And once you have it and you feel like, okay, our ecosystems are suffering.  Then you act whatever the walls, and that's what those pioneers have done.  
**[1:17:35-1:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:17:35):**  Like really they've had, they have China walls in front of them, or do you say that they  call me right?  The Chinese wall, whatever in front of them.  
**[1:17:45-1:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:17:45):**  And they, they've just climbed them.  And I'm like, I keep on there like, how the fuck did you do it?  And it's because every time you talk to them is that they have a deep sense of being linked  
**[1:17:54-1:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:17:54):**  to social and their social and environmental ecosystems.  They see it suffering and they don't want to be part of that suffering.  They want to find answers to solve that.  
**[1:18:08-1:18:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:18:08):**  And it's that deep encourage that made them stand in front of a tide that was just washing  everything over, washing everything out.  I think it's dangerous now that, you see, it leads to another question, that the financial  
**[1:18:27-1:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:18:27):**  world, which predominantly has been extractive for the last decade, I mean, before, I mean,  there was always a role of money.  Of course, we try to explore that here in the podcast, a role of money to create and  
**[1:18:38-1:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:18:38):**  to build and of course, to colonize and extract and all of that.  But to especially last the financial sector has become mostly about the financial sector,  let's say like getting interested in food and agriculture and maybe visiting these pioneers  
**[1:18:53-1:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:18:53):**  and is that dangerous that we're going to put pressure on them for maybe returns or  certain conditions or you say, man, they've climbed these walls.  They have, let's say, fought tougher fights.  
**[1:19:06-1:19:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:19:06):**  They are more than able to keep the walls of Wall Street at bay.  Is that dangerous that we start to pay a lot of attention and start knocking on their door  with billions of dollars to invest and to change the countryside and to store carbon  
**[1:19:22-1:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:19:22):**  and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah?  Do you see a risk there?  Oh, yes, of course, always.  
**[1:19:27-1:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:19:27):**  But the thing is, that's why we build a peer to peer farmer network is that we don't want  any expert.  And I'm not a good example.  
**[1:19:36-1:19:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:19:36):**  Maybe I'm kind of an expert, but let's say I'm also trying to apply.  I'm trying to walk my dogs.  That's why I'm part of that core group that create that network.  
**[1:19:46-1:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:19:46):**  But you know, we are basically untouchable because all those farmers, they are economically  independent.  And once you are economically independent, they fuck your money as Nassim Taleb would  
**[1:19:57-1:20:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:19:57):**  say.  Yeah.  So you can really take pressure.  
**[1:20:00-1:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:20:00):**  So you welcome whoever you want and you reject whoever you want.  And that's how we want to work.  You cannot take pressure.  
**[1:20:07-1:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:20:07):**  You can't take pressure because right now your system works.  So you know, you want to extract something from me.  Yeah.  
**[1:20:14-1:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:20:14):**  Just fuck off.  You know, I don't need you.  I'm going to work with it.  
**[1:20:17-1:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:20:17):**  It's very interesting.  Yeah.  That's a good point.  
**[1:20:20-1:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:20:20):**  Because right now the farmers, there are no expert, like they're considered as no expert.  They're just considered as a, as a, as a bad piece and produce what I'm going to sell for  you.  
**[1:20:31-1:20:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:20:31):**  Like, no, no, no, no, no.  It's not how it should work.  No, look, I'm going to sell you whatever I want from my production.  
**[1:20:37-1:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:20:37):**  And you're going to pay me well for that because it's made with love, a lot of healthy environmental  social benefits.  So those famous ecosystem services, and you're going to pay me well for that.  
**[1:20:50-1:21:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:20:50):**  And we're going to start redistributing the cards.  Like I'm part of a Federation that is advocating at a European level.  And that Federation helps me standing my ground, keeping my added value, selling to whoever  
**[1:21:03-1:21:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:21:03):**  I want.  I'm not saying you're bad.  I'm just saying, let's be back at the, at the negotiation table.  
**[1:21:11-1:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:21:11):**  I think that's a perfect way to end this conversation.  I don't think it's the last time we talk about this.  This is a story to be followed.  
**[1:21:21-1:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:21:21):**  And I would love to keep doing that over time.  So thank you so much for your time.  Thank you so much for making time today.

**[1:22:46-1:22:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:22:46):**  how to put money to work in regenerating soils, and I've been following the space since 2011  and recording these podcasts since 2016, we thought it was time to share our lessons learned.  What have we seen in the space over the last years?  
**[1:22:58-1:23:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:22:58):**  How have we built our decision-making framework?  What to focus on with the podcast?  How have we picked interviewees and what questions should you ask?  
**[1:23:07-1:23:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:23:07):**  What is happening in the space?  What should you read?  What should you listen?  
**[1:23:11-1:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:23:11):**  What should you watch?  How to approach this space for whom is this course?  You the soil builders and investors in this space, the soil builders, people working in  
**[1:23:20-1:23:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:23:20):**  this space, entrepreneurial farmers, fund managers, vehicle builders, crowd investing,  platform builders, act tech companies, farm to gut food companies, permaculture, key line  designers, holistic management, consultants, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[1:23:33-1:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:23:33):**  People that are building soil at scale and the investors who are putting their own money  to work through their family office or as private individuals or people who are putting  other people's money to work through foundations, institutional capital, banks, insurance companies,  
**[1:23:47-1:23:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:23:47):**  et cetera.  Is this course free?  No.  
**[1:23:50-1:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:23:50):**  This is pay what you think it's worth.  Meaning I have no way of knowing what this course will be worth to you.  And I'm very aware that among the listeners of this podcast, we have people with very  
**[1:24:01-1:24:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:24:01):**  different means.  So I'm inviting you if this course is creating value to you.  And if you have the means to consider paying what you think it's worth, thank you.  
**[1:24:11-1:24:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:24:11):**  So what is this course?  It's currently a series of 17 videos, mostly ranging from 10 to 15 minutes plus PDF slides.  So you don't have to ride along.  
**[1:24:21-1:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:24:21):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[1:24:36-1:24:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:24:36):**  if you're a soil builder.  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.  
**[1:24:46-1:24:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:24:46):**  We're going to look at nutrient density, landscape design, and a lot more.  So what is it not?  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[1:24:54-1:25:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:24:54):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  It's also not investment advice.  
**[1:25:02-1:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/herve-dupied#t=1:25:02):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.
