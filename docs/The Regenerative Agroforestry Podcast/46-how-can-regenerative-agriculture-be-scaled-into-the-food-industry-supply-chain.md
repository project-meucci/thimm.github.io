### The Regenerative Agroforestry Podcast  (Mon, 26 Sep 2022 14:37:06)
**0:00:00-0:00:16:**  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  
**0:00:16-0:00:18:**  our soils and ecosystems?  
**0:00:18-0:00:23:**  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?  
**0:00:23-0:00:27:**  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  
**0:00:27-0:00:32:**  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  
**0:00:32-0:00:33:**  these challenges.  
**0:00:33-0:00:38:**  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  
**0:00:38-0:00:43:**  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  
**0:00:43-0:00:46:**  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.  
**0:00:46-0:00:51:**  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have a special episode for you.  
**0:00:51-0:00:55:**  Two weeks ago we attended the Regenerative Agriculture and Food Systems Summit organized  
**0:00:55-0:01:01:**  by Kiasco Research to catalyze a regenerative transition in the food industry.  
**0:01:01-0:01:05:**  The event was attended by large corporations such as Nestlé, Unilever and Yara as well  
**0:01:05-0:01:11:**  as numerous companies and organizations that work actively with Regen Ag on the ground.  
**0:01:11-0:01:15:**  We attended the conference as media partners as part of our mission to explore the different  
**0:01:15-0:01:22:**  dimensions of regenerative agriculture, producing many interviews with a variety of summit attendees.  
**0:01:22-0:01:26:**  The objective of this episode is to try and understand the value of the strategies being  
**0:01:26-0:01:30:**  implemented by large corporations as well as the way in which technical and specialized  
**0:01:30-0:01:33:**  companies are working to scale Regen Ag.  
**0:01:33-0:01:37:**  Whilst many of you who work actively in this space may not feel aligned with some of the  
**0:01:37-0:01:42:**  companies we have interviewed, we believe in the value of having open and objective  
**0:01:42-0:01:49:**  conversations with all players in the field in order for us to form our own opinions.  
**0:01:49-0:01:53:**  We believe that the food corporations, whether we like it or not, are hugely influential  
**0:01:53-0:02:00:**  in the food system today and must be considered if we are to rapidly scale regenerative agriculture.  
**0:02:00-0:02:04:**  So we had a fantastic time at the conference and we would like to thank everybody who took  
**0:02:04-0:02:07:**  time to talk to us and we really hope that you enjoy the episode.  
**0:02:07-0:02:12:**  Hello Anne-Sophie, thanks for talking to us today.  
**0:02:12-0:02:14:**  Maybe you could tell us a bit about what's Spreur Proger.  
**0:02:14-0:02:17:**  Yes, Spreur Proger is a big up.  
**0:02:17-0:02:23:**  We were founded in 2008 and we are a project developer involved in nature-based solution  
**0:02:23-0:02:30:**  projects, agroforestry, regenerative agriculture and we work directly with the farming communities  
**0:02:30-0:02:33:**  inside companies' supply chain.  
**0:02:33-0:02:41:**  And our main focus is to address key corporate commitments such as SBTI while delivering  
**0:02:41-0:02:48:**  a positive impact on the field regarding carbon, biodiversity, soil, water, but also human  
**0:02:48-0:02:52:**  life and how we produce the food we need.  
**0:02:52-0:02:55:**  Okay, amazing, that's really interesting.  
**0:02:55-0:03:00:**  And when we were talking earlier on in the hallway you were telling us a bit about how  
**0:03:00-0:03:04:**  Proproject is working with changing the supply chain of these companies and this is obviously  
**0:03:04-0:03:07:**  a big theme that we're hearing about in this conference.  
**0:03:07-0:03:10:**  So maybe you could tell us a bit more about how that works and how you're actually engaging  
**0:03:10-0:03:14:**  with the larger companies in the supply chain.  
**0:03:14-0:03:21:**  Yes, that's really the major focus for us, the supply chain and working with farmers.  
**0:03:21-0:03:23:**  So how does it start?  
**0:03:23-0:03:30:**  It's first making sure that the commitment taken by the company has a reality on the  
**0:03:30-0:03:34:**  field and meets the needs of the farming communities.  
**0:03:34-0:03:40:**  So we do feasibility study on the ground, work directly with cooperative, with the farmers  
**0:03:40-0:03:47:**  to seek the interest of the farming communities to understand which activities and interventions  
**0:03:47-0:03:48:**  can be implemented.  
**0:03:48-0:03:54:**  So agroforestry of course, but can be also training, creating tree nurseries, monitoring  
**0:03:54-0:04:05:**  the impact, do additional activities regarding social benefits or the economy and market  
**0:04:05-0:04:06:**  access.  
**0:04:06-0:04:14:**  All of that set of activities and interests from the farmer that we look during the feasibility  
**0:04:14-0:04:15:**  study.  
**0:04:15-0:04:21:**  And honestly, this is really a major point for success of a project is to take time to  
**0:04:21-0:04:29:**  understand the field and also draw some insights that you can then deliver to your client,  
**0:04:29-0:04:33:**  to the company who wants to change its supply chain.  
**0:04:33-0:04:39:**  And another key factor of success to change the supply chain is also meet the company's  
**0:04:39-0:04:46:**  strategy because those investments are also very risky for the company, very complex.  
**0:04:46-0:04:50:**  It takes time, money and resources, human people working on that.  
**0:04:50-0:04:55:**  So it's important that everything that has been put on a project has also value for the  
**0:04:55-0:04:56:**  company.  
**0:04:56-0:05:03:**  So meaning that the design of a project will meet, for instance, an SBTI strategy.  
**0:05:03-0:05:12:**  So we put into action also other expertise that we have internally, regenerative agriculture  
**0:05:12-0:05:20:**  expert that will work on soil testing, carbon monitoring, various set of monitoring activities  
**0:05:20-0:05:28:**  that are able to provide key PIs, measurable results over time.  
**0:05:28-0:05:34:**  And another value we bring to the company to secure their investment is to have people  
**0:05:34-0:05:35:**  on the field.  
**0:05:35-0:05:41:**  So on the field, we always have the methodology of the project as a team.  
**0:05:41-0:05:47:**  And also we train the cooperative technicians to build capacities on the field because of  
**0:05:47-0:05:55:**  course one day we will leave the area and what we want is that the project remains and  
**0:05:55-0:05:58:**  is taken over by the community.  
**0:05:58-0:06:01:**  So capacity building also is important.  
**0:06:01-0:06:03:**  That's very, very interesting stuff.  
**0:06:03-0:06:08:**  You're basically acting like middlemen as well, between, or middlemen, middlewomen between  
**0:06:08-0:06:12:**  the corporations of the larger companies and what's happening in the field.  
**0:06:12-0:06:21:**  So I'm curious as to what's the value that these companies are seeing in creating regenerative  
**0:06:21-0:06:22:**  projects.  
**0:06:22-0:06:24:**  So what's their motivation?  
**0:06:24-0:06:27:**  And you're telling me also when we're talking about your own, you're saying that you're  
**0:06:27-0:06:30:**  really trying to focus on this value, what's valuable to them.  
**0:06:30-0:06:35:**  So could you tell us a bit more about what is that for them?  
**0:06:35-0:06:42:**  What we see is that most of the companies, especially after COVID crisis, are aware of  
**0:06:42-0:06:48:**  the challenge and the need to grow food in a sustainable way, in particular a way that  
**0:06:48-0:06:50:**  regenerates ecosystem.  
**0:06:50-0:06:55:**  So I would say that the starting point of a company is the same than any of the people  
**0:06:55-0:06:58:**  working on that topic.  
**0:06:58-0:07:05:**  Even the special value a company is seeking is measurable impact for their claim, for  
**0:07:05-0:07:10:**  their carbon climate claim, but also all the type of claim that they do for the consumer.  
**0:07:10-0:07:18:**  So they also want to prove that their action is real and also that the action is aligned  
**0:07:18-0:07:22:**  with the stake we are facing, meaning it can be scalable.  
**0:07:22-0:07:27:**  It's not only a small impact, it can be a big project.  
**0:07:27-0:07:33:**  And I think that company wants to see the level of positive contribution they have on  
**0:07:33-0:07:34:**  the field.  
**0:07:34-0:07:45:**  So when I say see, it's a mix of reporting KPIs, but also photo field studies, interviews  
**0:07:45-0:07:46:**  with farmers.  
**0:07:46-0:07:52:**  So it can be very various set of proof that the company will seek.  
**0:07:52-0:07:58:**  And then ultimately, I think that most of the companies want to engage the whole supply  
**0:07:58-0:07:59:**  chain.  
**0:07:59-0:08:04:**  So they were the pioneer and they developed a pilot project.  
**0:08:04-0:08:10:**  But I think that especially in annual cropping system, the companies would like the other  
**0:08:10-0:08:13:**  to join and also have an impact.  
**0:08:13-0:08:21:**  It's complex, but I also see companies asking us, can you find other companies able to invest  
**0:08:21-0:08:28:**  with us and find a model that works for us and for our competitors or for other supply  
**0:08:28-0:08:29:**  chain actors.  
**0:08:29-0:08:33:**  So synergies is an important piece of the puzzle.  
**0:08:33-0:08:34:**  Okay, that's really interesting.  
**0:08:34-0:08:41:**  And one of the things that was discussed in the last talk here was about the economics  
**0:08:41-0:08:43:**  of creating regenerative projects.  
**0:08:43-0:08:49:**  And in your experience with the projects that you've been working on, do you see investing  
**0:08:49-0:08:55:**  in regenerative as being able to bring, for example, reducing costs or bringing more resilience  
**0:08:55-0:08:57:**  to the companies that you're working with?  
**0:08:57-0:09:03:**  Is there like an economic value beyond just communicating to customers and demonstrating  
**0:09:03-0:09:06:**  to the world that they are actually investing in regeneration?  
**0:09:06-0:09:12:**  Yes, so it's not an economic value as we are used to.  
**0:09:12-0:09:15:**  It's not a pure return on investment.  
**0:09:15-0:09:23:**  It's more like creating shared value for the supply chain, shared value for yourself as  
**0:09:23-0:09:30:**  a company because you will maybe reduce cost of managing your procurement, reduce risk  
**0:09:30-0:09:32:**  regarding volumes and quality.  
**0:09:32-0:09:36:**  So obviously, yes, there is a return on investment in there.  
**0:09:36-0:09:41:**  There is also the brand image and the corporate value to shareholder.  
**0:09:41-0:09:49:**  But in fact, what you will also bring to your supply chain is its value related.  
**0:09:49-0:09:55:**  For instance, let's say if you reduce fertilizer, you avoid cost on the field for the farmer.  
**0:09:55-0:10:03:**  By funding REJAG practices, you reduce the use of fertilizer, you reduce the use of water,  
**0:10:03-0:10:06:**  you will improve the quality.  
**0:10:06-0:10:14:**  Even it has been said in recent study that the agronomic quality of the product improves  
**0:10:14-0:10:15:**  through REJAG.  
**0:10:15-0:10:20:**  So you create multiple benefits and they have monetary value.  
**0:10:20-0:10:28:**  The only challenge today is that it's hard to put all of those shared value and net benefits  
**0:10:28-0:10:30:**  into a single number.  
**0:10:30-0:10:31:**  Very interesting.  
**0:10:31-0:10:32:**  Well, that's fascinating stuff.  
**0:10:32-0:10:36:**  Thank you so much for talking to us today and for taking the time to explain a bit more  
**0:10:36-0:10:38:**  about Proprojere.  
**0:10:38-0:10:42:**  And if anybody else wants to find out more, where can we find more information about you?  
**0:10:42-0:10:47:**  So you can definitely visit our website, but also if you are in Paris, come and say hi  
**0:10:47-0:10:48:**  at our office.  
**0:10:48-0:10:51:**  We are very keen in meeting people.  
**0:10:51-0:10:52:**  Fantastic.  
**0:10:52-0:10:54:**  Thank you so much.  
**0:10:54-0:10:59:**  Hello Roberto and thanks for coming on and talking to us today.  
**0:10:59-0:11:03:**  Maybe you can just give us a bit of an intro as to a very short one as to who you are and  
**0:11:03-0:11:07:**  then we'll understand a bit more about your work with regenerative agriculture.  
**0:11:07-0:11:08:**  My name is Roberto Vega.  
**0:11:08-0:11:13:**  I'm the head of Global Valley Chain for Sinhanta Group.  
**0:11:13-0:11:20:**  Basically my team supports companies, implementation of the sustainable sourcing programs.  
**0:11:20-0:11:25:**  We also work with academia and NGOs or other type of stakeholders, more on the thought  
**0:11:25-0:11:31:**  leadership piece, so trying to develop knowledge that then is the one that we transfer to our  
**0:11:31-0:11:34:**  farmers in order to improve their practices.  
**0:11:34-0:11:39:**  This is very well connected with the whole Reaching Act discussion.  
**0:11:39-0:11:44:**  I'm sitting in the steering committee of the Reaching Act program of Site Platform, for  
**0:11:44-0:11:50:**  example, where we're also supporting the organization to develop the knowledge, the narrative, the  
**0:11:50-0:11:56:**  KPIs that we're going to be using later to assess practices on the ground.  
**0:11:56-0:11:57:**  Fantastic.  
**0:11:57-0:12:02:**  Maybe you could tell us a bit more in detail as to how Sinhanta is engaging with Regen  
**0:12:02-0:12:07:**  Ag and what kind of strategy changes from previous activities or the previous strategies  
**0:12:07-0:12:11:**  Regen Ag is having on Sinhanta.  
**0:12:11-0:12:13:**  That's an interesting question.  
**0:12:13-0:12:17:**  It's an interesting question because I would say Sinhanta has been working on Regen Ag  
**0:12:17-0:12:19:**  for many, many years actually.  
**0:12:19-0:12:23:**  Just that we didn't call it that way at the time.  
**0:12:23-0:12:29:**  We have been putting a strong focus on soil and biodiversity, developing new solutions,  
**0:12:29-0:12:34:**  new technologies that are really in this direction.  
**0:12:34-0:12:39:**  We also are moving from an input provider company into a more holistic service input  
**0:12:39-0:12:44:**  provider company where we're really bringing this knowledge also to the farmers.  
**0:12:44-0:12:51:**  So not only the inputs as such and only the products, but also all the different elements  
**0:12:51-0:12:57:**  that need to complement those products in order for the products to be used safely and  
**0:12:57-0:12:59:**  to deliver the results that they need.  
**0:12:59-0:13:03:**  Of course, productivity is on the top of the agenda.  
**0:13:03-0:13:07:**  We want farmers to be successful.  
**0:13:07-0:13:09:**  That's ultimately the purpose.  
**0:13:09-0:13:14:**  But we also recognize that soil, as I said before, soil and biodiversity play a very  
**0:13:14-0:13:15:**  important role.  
**0:13:15-0:13:19:**  So for many years, Sinhanta has been working on these topics.  
**0:13:19-0:13:25:**  We launched the Good Growth Plan, which was a way to measure the sustainability impact  
**0:13:25-0:13:27:**  of our strategy on the ground.  
**0:13:27-0:13:29:**  We launched it in 2014.  
**0:13:29-0:13:33:**  Now we are revising our strategy, but the main pillars remain the same.  
**0:13:33-0:13:41:**  So biodiversity and soil will always be very important elements of our strategy.  
**0:13:41-0:13:46:**  In addition to that, to complement that strategy or support that strategy, we've been investing  
**0:13:46-0:13:52:**  a lot in different solutions that were not necessarily our core business in the past.  
**0:13:52-0:13:54:**  I'm talking here about digital agriculture.  
**0:13:54-0:13:59:**  I'm talking here about biological solutions that we are adding to the portfolio.  
**0:13:59-0:14:05:**  So we're really bringing a very diverse and very robust portfolio to farmers with new  
**0:14:05-0:14:12:**  genetics in our seeds, with new pesticides that are very well aligned with these topics  
**0:14:12-0:14:17:**  of soil health, biodiversity health, biodiversity friendly products.  
**0:14:17-0:14:21:**  And then in addition to that, digital tools to help farmers to take better decisions and  
**0:14:21-0:14:28:**  of course biological solutions that complement the whole portfolio with the possibility of  
**0:14:28-0:14:33:**  having much better, much sound integrated pest management systems that is also part  
**0:14:33-0:14:37:**  of what we're trying to do today and what we're trying to propose to the farmers.  
**0:14:37-0:14:43:**  That's very interesting to understand how Syngenta is evolving with Regen Agriculture.  
**0:14:43-0:14:49:**  And one of the questions that comes to mind is, how much does Regen Agriculture represent  
**0:14:49-0:14:50:**  for Syngenta?  
**0:14:50-0:14:55:**  Is it a marginal kind of side project going on at the moment or is it really a core part  
**0:14:55-0:14:59:**  of the business strategy and the evolution in the sense, just to understand a bit where  
**0:14:59-0:15:06:**  we stand with, how much has it integrated with Syngenta's strategy?  
**0:15:06-0:15:12:**  I would basically say it's not necessarily how much does it represent of Syngenta's strategy,  
**0:15:12-0:15:14:**  our strategy supporting farmers.  
**0:15:14-0:15:20:**  And what we recognize is that the farming community is evolving as well.  
**0:15:20-0:15:24:**  The situation that we're facing today when we see extreme weather conditions all around  
**0:15:24-0:15:32:**  the world, when we see what is happening with the depletion of soils or the loss of biodiversity,  
**0:15:32-0:15:37:**  this basically takes and requires an urgent response from the whole industry.  
**0:15:37-0:15:44:**  So if I turn it into different worlds, I would say this is the direction that we are taking  
**0:15:44-0:15:51:**  in the ag sector and that's what we believe will continue growing as a trend, not regenerative  
**0:15:51-0:15:52:**  agriculture.  
**0:15:52-0:15:57:**  For those who have been working in Sustainable Ag for some years, we see that the topics  
**0:15:57-0:16:01:**  are not necessarily different but what we are really making as a big difference is we  
**0:16:01-0:16:04:**  need to move from practices into outcomes.  
**0:16:04-0:16:10:**  So I think that the transformation has already started, it will take time to really get the  
**0:16:10-0:16:16:**  full adoption but we believe that the core business of the company will be basically  
**0:16:16-0:16:23:**  based on a new system where regenerative agriculture is going to be their rule and it's going to  
**0:16:23-0:16:28:**  be mainstream among farmers all around the world.  
**0:16:28-0:16:34:**  One of the topics in regenerative agriculture that's often discussed by regenerative farmers  
**0:16:34-0:16:36:**  is input reduction.  
**0:16:36-0:16:41:**  So how can we replace inputs with biological processes and etc.  
**0:16:41-0:16:48:**  This may challenge an input company in terms of the fact that it may mean less products  
**0:16:48-0:16:49:**  sold and etc.  
**0:16:49-0:16:53:**  I'm just wondering what's your take on this aspect of Regen Ag.  
**0:16:53-0:16:59:**  Absolutely, I completely agree with you and that's why it is important to revise our business  
**0:16:59-0:17:05:**  models and to revise the portfolio of solutions that we are offering to the farmers.  
**0:17:05-0:17:10:**  When we look at Regen Ag and when we look at the elements that compose Regen Ag, we  
**0:17:10-0:17:15:**  were talking about soy, we were talking about biodiversity, we recognize that the beauty  
**0:17:15-0:17:22:**  of the products relies on how the products are used and in many cases there have been  
**0:17:22-0:17:27:**  misused products, there has been abuse of products.  
**0:17:27-0:17:32:**  In other cases we may need to use more products depending on the situation and depending on  
**0:17:32-0:17:37:**  the conditions of the farms and basically what we're looking for is the right balance.  
**0:17:37-0:17:44:**  We are looking for a balance where we can continue producing given the situation that  
**0:17:44-0:17:49:**  we're facing today, we can continue producing for many years but continue producing in a  
**0:17:49-0:17:56:**  way that we reduce negative externalities on biodiversity or negative externalities  
**0:17:56-0:17:59:**  on soil.  
**0:17:59-0:18:04:**  Does this mean that we are going to be selling less conventional chemistry?  
**0:18:04-0:18:10:**  Absolutely yes and that's why it is important to diversify the portfolio, to look for other  
**0:18:10-0:18:16:**  solutions, to get into tools like digital ag solutions that are really bringing those  
**0:18:16-0:18:19:**  benefits and changing the ways of working and the business models of companies like  
**0:18:19-0:18:21:**  Syngenta.  
**0:18:21-0:18:26:**  One last question is more relating to farmers and your practical experience in the field.  
**0:18:26-0:18:31:**  What are you seeing are the benefits to farmers from your experience and the different trials,  
**0:18:31-0:18:36:**  experiments and what you've seen so far, what are the practical benefits that you're seeing  
**0:18:36-0:18:41:**  for farmers of adopting regenerative agriculture strategies and especially looking at economics,  
**0:18:41-0:18:44:**  what do you see as the economic impact on farmers?  
**0:18:44-0:18:48:**  Does it increase cost, reduce profitability or increase profitability?  
**0:18:48-0:18:49:**  What are you seeing in the field?  
**0:18:49-0:18:57:**  Yes and that's a very interesting question because the reality is every system is going  
**0:18:57-0:19:03:**  to be different and it's going to be affected or needs to be treated in a different way.  
**0:19:03-0:19:09:**  It's not the same talking about the spices farmers in India or talking about coffee farmers  
**0:19:09-0:19:10:**  in Colombia.  
**0:19:10-0:19:13:**  I mean they're going to have different challenges.  
**0:19:13-0:19:20:**  What we expect ultimately is that farmers are better off and better off means eventually  
**0:19:20-0:19:26:**  increasing their productivity, better off means accessing better markets, having better  
**0:19:26-0:19:31:**  conditions with the markets they are supplying to but also reducing the cost.  
**0:19:31-0:19:37:**  As you mentioned before there will probably be reduction of inputs in some cases and in  
**0:19:37-0:19:43:**  those cases farmers are going to be benefiting from lower cost.  
**0:19:43-0:19:48:**  At the same time there's something that we need to bear in mind which is ultimately this  
**0:19:48-0:19:53:**  is also an economical decision because if we don't do what we need to do now we will  
**0:19:53-0:19:55:**  not continue farming in the future.  
**0:19:55-0:20:03:**  So if we want continuity for the farmers and for the farms we need to take these actions.  
**0:20:03-0:20:08:**  So if we look at it from a financial point of view what we are basically doing is we  
**0:20:08-0:20:13:**  are ensuring that farmers will be able to continue farming for many years.  
**0:20:13-0:20:20:**  Otherwise if we don't take these actions basically we can assume that the farm will have a short  
**0:20:20-0:20:21:**  life term.  
**0:20:21-0:20:28:**  So this is as I said in the end a clear financial benefit for the farmers.  
**0:20:28-0:20:38:**  But yes reduction of course, better markets, better treatment of their soils and of course  
**0:20:38-0:20:47:**  productivity in the end is what we are looking for through these new practices and approaches.  
**0:20:47-0:20:51:**  Thank you so much Roberto for taking the time to talk to us and I hope you enjoy the rest  
**0:20:51-0:20:52:**  of the conference.  
**0:20:52-0:20:54:**  My pleasure, thank you very much.  
**0:20:54-0:20:58:**  Hi Andrew welcome and thanks a lot for talking to us.  
**0:20:58-0:20:59:**  Pleasure Dimitri.  
**0:20:59-0:21:04:**  Awesome, so I wanted to bounce off some of the things that we heard in your conference  
**0:21:04-0:21:10:**  in the talk that you gave a bit earlier on and around the economics of regenerative agriculture  
**0:21:10-0:21:15:**  and it's all capital, you've earned a lot of experience working with farmers and so  
**0:21:15-0:21:20:**  I wanted to know a bit more about what does regenerative agriculture cost for farmers,  
**0:21:20-0:21:24:**  what's the impact on profitability, what can we expect?  
**0:21:24-0:21:29:**  So what I was trying to explain this morning, you know, Soil Capital by background is an  
**0:21:29-0:21:35:**  agronomic advisory firm, we've worked with farmers all around the world on transitioning  
**0:21:35-0:21:42:**  from conventional systems to regenerative systems with a focus on improving farm profitability.  
**0:21:42-0:21:50:**  And now we work alongside farmers helping them to earn carbon payments, in our case  
**0:21:50-0:21:55:**  from the supply chain, from food and beverage companies that are also buying their crops.  
**0:21:55-0:22:02:**  And so it becomes really really important that we all build an understanding of what  
**0:22:02-0:22:10:**  are the implications, economic and practical implications of farmers making these transitions  
**0:22:10-0:22:14:**  from all different starting points, right, you've got farmers who are already experienced  
**0:22:14-0:22:19:**  in certain soil health building practices, you've got others who are not at all focused  
**0:22:19-0:22:20:**  on that in their system today.  
**0:22:20-0:22:27:**  And what I was trying to explain was that it's very common to understand that ultimately  
**0:22:27-0:22:34:**  once you've achieved a more regenerative system, you can expect lower production costs, at  
**0:22:34-0:22:40:**  least equal yields or better, and so better operating margins overall.  
**0:22:40-0:22:41:**  So that's the destination.  
**0:22:41-0:22:46:**  And the question is really, the more interesting question is, what does the journey look like  
**0:22:46-0:22:51:**  from from where a farmer is today, to get to that destination.  
**0:22:51-0:22:57:**  Now in our practical experience firsthand, as Soil Capital, we have seen what we describe  
**0:22:57-0:23:05:**  of as the node J curve transition, by which we mean, there doesn't need to be a dip in  
**0:23:05-0:23:09:**  either productivity or profitability on that journey from the very beginning.  
**0:23:09-0:23:14:**  And you can do that if you're designing that transition in a really knowledge intensive  
**0:23:14-0:23:18:**  way, right, you're looking at the input side of your farm system, you're maybe looking  
**0:23:18-0:23:24:**  at your fertiliser and your crop protection package, you're looking for areas where you  
**0:23:24-0:23:28:**  can optimise without taking unnecessary risk.  
**0:23:28-0:23:31:**  And you're making an instant cash saving when you do that.  
**0:23:31-0:23:36:**  And you can then reinvest that in a multi species cover crop, which unlocks opportunities  
**0:23:36-0:23:39:**  in the following season, for example.  
**0:23:39-0:23:44:**  So we've seen that it's possible to, with the right knowledge, and the right approach  
**0:23:44-0:23:50:**  to managing risk, make that transition smooth from a profitability point of view, improving  
**0:23:50-0:23:51:**  profitability.  
**0:23:51-0:23:56:**  But the message I was really trying to give today to the corporate audience here was,  
**0:23:56-0:24:00:**  like I've just said, that really depends on having access to the right knowledge, which  
**0:24:00-0:24:07:**  for many farmers is going to be tough, you know, the advice and the knowledge that they  
**0:24:07-0:24:14:**  have available is more often than not going to come from a conventional system, let's  
**0:24:14-0:24:15:**  say around them.  
**0:24:15-0:24:22:**  And so their experience of this transition may well involve greater costs up front, they  
**0:24:22-0:24:27:**  may well make mistakes and see more risk coming into their system, which affects yields.  
**0:24:27-0:24:33:**  And for that reason, that transition does need extra financial reward and incentive  
**0:24:33-0:24:39:**  from somewhere to persuade many, many farmers to go on that journey.  
**0:24:39-0:24:44:**  And that's the role of carbon credits, or I don't think you call them carbon credits,  
**0:24:44-0:24:45:**  it's soil capital, right?  
**0:24:45-0:24:50:**  Could you explain to us maybe a bit more about how you work with carbon payments and just  
**0:24:50-0:24:53:**  tell us what's the, how it works in practice for farmers?  
**0:24:53-0:24:54:**  Yeah, of course.  
**0:24:54-0:24:59:**  I mean, the transition we made as a business was that we came to the recognition that I've  
**0:24:59-0:25:05:**  just described that for many, many farmers, a new financial incentive would be needed  
**0:25:05-0:25:09:**  to persuade them to take the risk of starting to change their, you know, their fundamental  
**0:25:09-0:25:11:**  operating system.  
**0:25:11-0:25:16:**  And so we looked around at the different ways that we as a small agronomy business could  
**0:25:16-0:25:17:**  catalyse that.  
**0:25:17-0:25:24:**  And we landed on carbon as one outcome of improving your soil health, you end up reducing  
**0:25:24-0:25:30:**  your carbon emissions and increasing your soil carbon sequestration.  
**0:25:30-0:25:37:**  We do that not by generating offsets from those carbon improvements, meaning a company  
**0:25:37-0:25:43:**  that has no other relationship to the farmer will pay the farmer to make carbon improvements  
**0:25:43-0:25:47:**  so that they can claim carbon neutrality over there somewhere.  
**0:25:47-0:25:52:**  Instead, we focus on keeping that carbon inside the supply chain.  
**0:25:52-0:25:59:**  So the same companies that buy the crops, the wheat, the barley, etc, from farms are  
**0:25:59-0:26:05:**  using our platform to pay farmers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions at farm level.  
**0:26:05-0:26:07:**  Why are they doing that?  
**0:26:07-0:26:13:**  Because those supply chain emissions are actually on those companies carbon balance sheet.  
**0:26:13-0:26:20:**  And so their investors care, their customers increasingly may care.  
**0:26:20-0:26:25:**  And actually, certainly their procurement people care because what they're seeing from  
**0:26:25-0:26:31:**  a procurement side is more and more supply chain shocks from extreme weather, droughts,  
**0:26:31-0:26:32:**  floods.  
**0:26:32-0:26:37:**  But they're sitting there with the knowledge that healthy soil, soil with more carbon in  
**0:26:37-0:26:41:**  it is more resilient to drought and flood.  
**0:26:41-0:26:45:**  So it's a better bet if you're in procurement to be buying from healthy soil.  
**0:26:45-0:26:51:**  So there's a set of logic that will drive food and beverage companies to make these  
**0:26:51-0:26:52:**  kinds of investments.  
**0:26:52-0:26:54:**  Okay, that's really interesting.  
**0:26:54-0:26:58:**  And just understand that the message that you made earlier on, you believe that this  
**0:26:58-0:27:06:**  knowledge, the knowledge to be able to have a no J curve transition will be fundamental  
**0:27:06-0:27:09:**  to scale regenerative agriculture.  
**0:27:09-0:27:11:**  Is that, did I understand that correctly?  
**0:27:11-0:27:18:**  Yeah, look, I think still this is a barrier that holds many farmers back the expectation,  
**0:27:18-0:27:23:**  the experience, even if they've tried something or just the belief that there will be economic  
**0:27:23-0:27:25:**  loss involved.  
**0:27:25-0:27:31:**  And you know, let's, let's be very real, the low margin environment that most I'm thinking  
**0:27:31-0:27:34:**  arable farmers, but this extends to others.  
**0:27:34-0:27:38:**  Most farmers live with, it doesn't give them a cushion to be able to take that kind of  
**0:27:38-0:27:39:**  risk.  
**0:27:39-0:27:43:**  So yeah, I think there are a couple of ingredients for scale that we see.  
**0:27:43-0:27:52:**  One is absolutely more farmers coming to believe that that transition can be done in a profit  
**0:27:52-0:27:57:**  compatibility, a profitability be enhancing way.  
**0:27:57-0:28:00:**  We're aiming to catalyze that with carbon payments.  
**0:28:00-0:28:04:**  Now we're also building the data set to prove it.  
**0:28:04-0:28:08:**  You know, I also think there's plenty of work that needs to happen on the corporate side  
**0:28:08-0:28:14:**  to build that return on investment case that I've been starting to outline earlier.  
**0:28:14-0:28:19:**  So that much more capital is put to work to invest in these kinds of solutions at scale  
**0:28:19-0:28:20:**  from the supply chain.  
**0:28:20-0:28:22:**  Okay, that's fantastic.  
**0:28:22-0:28:28:**  I think this is a really good overview as to your work at Sol Capital and also feedback  
**0:28:28-0:28:31:**  from your experience with the regenerative agriculture transition.  
**0:28:31-0:28:36:**  So thank you so much for taking the time to talk to us now and enjoy the rest of the conference.  
**0:28:36-0:28:37:**  Pleasure.  
**0:28:37-0:28:38:**  Thanks for the good work with the podcast.  
**0:28:38-0:28:42:**  I know you've been to visit my team in Belgium looking at the agroforestry work.  
**0:28:42-0:28:46:**  And you know, if there are listeners out there, farmers in France or Belgium or the UK in  
**0:28:46-0:28:49:**  our systems that are interested, we'd love to hear from them.  
**0:28:49-0:28:50:**  Fantastic.  
**0:28:50-0:28:52:**  So where could our listeners find out more about you?  
**0:28:52-0:28:54:**  Just head straight to our website, soilcapital.com.  
**0:28:54-0:28:59:**  One of the things we've built, which is quite handy, is a very quick free simulator.  
**0:28:59-0:29:05:**  So an arable farmer can plug in the details of their system and just model very quickly  
**0:29:05-0:29:08:**  what kind of carbon earnings they could be looking at through us.  
**0:29:08-0:29:10:**  It takes about 10 minutes, 10-15 minutes.  
**0:29:10-0:29:11:**  Amazing.  
**0:29:11-0:29:12:**  Thanks so much, Andrew.  
**0:29:12-0:29:13:**  Cheers.  
**0:29:13-0:29:14:**  Thank you very much.  
**0:29:14-0:29:16:**  Hello, Daniel, and welcome.  
**0:29:16-0:29:22:**  Maybe we could start by you giving us a bit of an intro as to who you are, where you work  
**0:29:22-0:29:24:**  and what you're doing here at the summit.  
**0:29:24-0:29:25:**  Yes, thank you very much.  
**0:29:25-0:29:28:**  And yeah, I work for Qantas International.  
**0:29:28-0:29:29:**  We are a consultancy.  
**0:29:29-0:29:36:**  Our focus is mostly climate, biodiversity and water, and we help companies to start  
**0:29:36-0:29:41:**  transforming businesses and going from business as usual to business at its best.  
**0:29:41-0:29:43:**  So our goal is really to help companies transform.  
**0:29:43-0:29:46:**  I personally grew up on an organic farm in Switzerland.  
**0:29:46-0:29:49:**  I studied agronomy and I was also working as a farmer.  
**0:29:49-0:29:55:**  So I tried to integrate my first-hand knowledge with theoretical knowledge about science and  
**0:29:55-0:30:00:**  tools how to accelerate transition towards regional agriculture.  
**0:30:00-0:30:01:**  Very nice.  
**0:30:01-0:30:04:**  So one of the first questions that we have for you is, you know, what is the role of  
**0:30:04-0:30:12:**  Qantas in the regenerative agricultural transition and how do you work with farmers or with corporates  
**0:30:12-0:30:13:**  to enable that?  
**0:30:13-0:30:18:**  Yeah, we are a science-based organization and our focus in the beginning was life-cycle  
**0:30:18-0:30:19:**  analysis.  
**0:30:19-0:30:20:**  So we have a lot of data.  
**0:30:20-0:30:25:**  So our goal is really to have good data for companies where they really find out what's  
**0:30:25-0:30:29:**  our environmental footprints in terms of climate, biodiversity, water, and then of course to  
**0:30:29-0:30:33:**  find ways how they can transform and then can improve.  
**0:30:33-0:30:38:**  And we help companies to define roadmaps, climate roadmaps, but also biodiversity roadmaps  
**0:30:38-0:30:40:**  and how to implement things.  
**0:30:40-0:30:45:**  So we don't work directly with farmers, but because we understand the whole value chain,  
**0:30:45-0:30:48:**  we can consult companies and help them to transition.  
**0:30:48-0:30:53:**  Especially, a regenerative agriculture is an interesting topic because everybody talks  
**0:30:53-0:30:58:**  about it, but there is still limited understanding in corporates.  
**0:30:58-0:31:01:**  If you talk to sustainability people, they have good understanding, but if you talk to  
**0:31:01-0:31:07:**  marketing people or supply chain people, there's still a lot of awareness building needed.  
**0:31:07-0:31:12:**  And our role is also to build awareness in companies, in communication, and help them  
**0:31:12-0:31:14:**  to understand what should be done in future.  
**0:31:14-0:31:16:**  Okay, that's very, very interesting.  
**0:31:16-0:31:21:**  Maybe you could give us some examples of some of the companies that you're, or examples  
**0:31:21-0:31:25:**  of how you're working with some of the companies in practice.  
**0:31:25-0:31:29:**  I mean, we have a lot of clients from the food industry and one example is not a big  
**0:31:29-0:31:33:**  company, it's a smaller company called Familia from Switzerland and they produce muesli.  
**0:31:33-0:31:38:**  You know, it's very famous in Switzerland and it's the only Swiss word which is known  
**0:31:38-0:31:39:**  globally.  
**0:31:39-0:31:42:**  But this company, they really wanted to embark on a journey where they, of course, they have  
**0:31:42-0:31:48:**  a climate strategy, they want to reduce emissions, comply with science-based targets, but they  
**0:31:48-0:31:49:**  want to go beyond.  
**0:31:49-0:31:54:**  And their aim is really to do something that is nature positive.  
**0:31:54-0:31:58:**  And I think that's something which inspires me because they have an ambition and they  
**0:31:58-0:32:05:**  have a clear view and we, from a Qantas perspective, we can support them with data so that they  
**0:32:05-0:32:10:**  find out what's our baseline and what's the potential to improve.  
**0:32:10-0:32:14:**  And I think there are many other companies in a similar approach, they want to find out,  
**0:32:14-0:32:20:**  well, if we do this practice or if we adapt our system in this direction, what's the impact?  
**0:32:20-0:32:26:**  So the question is always, what's the impact of change in practices in terms of climate  
**0:32:26-0:32:27:**  footprint?  
**0:32:27-0:32:31:**  My message is always, well, it has an impact on climate, but there is additional benefit  
**0:32:31-0:32:34:**  for biodiversity, water and livelihoods.  
**0:32:34-0:32:39:**  And I think if companies understand that there is a win-win-win approach, if they do it right  
**0:32:39-0:32:41:**  beyond climate, it's a huge opportunity.  
**0:32:41-0:32:46:**  And we see more and more companies, bigger, small, medium sized ones that are really seeing  
**0:32:46-0:32:52:**  it as a systemic and holistic transition and not just focusing on climate roadmaps.  
**0:32:52-0:32:57:**  And from your experience with the clients that you've consulted, do you see that, do  
**0:32:57-0:33:02:**  these clients see a business case for regenerative agriculture?  
**0:33:02-0:33:08:**  What's their motivations for adopting regenerative agriculture beyond being able to communicate  
**0:33:08-0:33:13:**  or to also, you know, to communicate to clients and to build this kind of bridge there?  
**0:33:13-0:33:17:**  I think there is still limited awareness about this.  
**0:33:17-0:33:22:**  I think they do it because they're under pressure, because of net zero claims or, you know, climate  
**0:33:22-0:33:24:**  issues or SPTI.  
**0:33:24-0:33:29:**  And I think they don't really understand the transformation that is needed in the supply  
**0:33:29-0:33:32:**  chain from soil to consumer.  
**0:33:32-0:33:39:**  And we see that there is still room for improvement, still room for a better understanding.  
**0:33:39-0:33:44:**  And I think if they just stick on climate, that's not enough.  
**0:33:44-0:33:48:**  They need to really understand also social issues.  
**0:33:48-0:33:50:**  And it's a holistic transformation.  
**0:33:50-0:33:54:**  And of course, then you need to find connections, you need to find partners to implement something  
**0:33:54-0:33:56:**  successfully on the ground.  
**0:33:56-0:33:59:**  Because there is no company that can do it alone.  
**0:33:59-0:34:00:**  They need partners.  
**0:34:00-0:34:02:**  They need local experts.  
**0:34:02-0:34:07:**  They need to have support for farmers that is on a local level.  
**0:34:07-0:34:10:**  And it's about partnerships, big competitive initiatives.  
**0:34:10-0:34:14:**  And that's something that's really needed in the future.  
**0:34:14-0:34:19:**  So do you see these companies as being ready to bear the cost of a regenerative agriculture  
**0:34:19-0:34:23:**  transition or how are they expecting to pay for this transition?  
**0:34:23-0:34:26:**  And I'm expecting that it's going to have a certain cost.  
**0:34:26-0:34:29:**  And to be honest, I think it's not sufficient.  
**0:34:29-0:34:33:**  Even if they pay a premium price, if they have some additional funding for farmers to  
**0:34:33-0:34:35:**  transition, that's not sufficient.  
**0:34:35-0:34:41:**  So there needs to be additional economic support from governments, from NGOs, and from the  
**0:34:41-0:34:42:**  private sector.  
**0:34:42-0:34:47:**  And I think it's only in a combination of different funding streams that the transition  
**0:34:47-0:34:49:**  can be successful.  
**0:34:49-0:34:53:**  Of course, at the end, the price for the product needs to be better than before.  
**0:34:53-0:34:59:**  I'm pretty convinced that there needs to be a better price that is paid to farmers.  
**0:34:59-0:35:05:**  But to have this investment in the systemic change, it's not enough just from the brands.  
**0:35:05-0:35:06:**  Very interesting.  
**0:35:06-0:35:11:**  And from your perspective, what are the key levers to change, to transition to regenerative  
**0:35:11-0:35:12:**  agriculture?  
**0:35:12-0:35:17:**  And by that, I mean, what are the biggest opportunities that you see for companies to  
**0:35:17-0:35:21:**  be able to be motivated and to actually create practical change?  
**0:35:21-0:35:25:**  I think one area that is important and key is leadership.  
**0:35:25-0:35:30:**  And we need to have leadership, be it in the board or CEO or management level, that understands  
**0:35:30-0:35:33:**  regeneration and I call it regenerative leadership that's needed.  
**0:35:33-0:35:38:**  So it needs a different approach and different view on a transition which is long term.  
**0:35:38-0:35:45:**  And it's not about quarterly reporting, it's about a 10-year plan, how to improve and transition  
**0:35:45-0:35:47:**  to a new state.  
**0:35:47-0:35:53:**  And I think on the other hand, we need more people that are, let's say, supporting this  
**0:35:53-0:35:55:**  transition.  
**0:35:55-0:36:01:**  So it's about building bridges and to work together in coalitions.  
**0:36:01-0:36:07:**  As we have seen the example from Nestle, Salviva in France, together with Earth Home Foundation.  
**0:36:07-0:36:12:**  So we always need to find the right partners to implement something on the ground.  
**0:36:12-0:36:18:**  And what's interesting that farmers are willing to make this transition, but what is needed  
**0:36:18-0:36:25:**  is beyond financial support, kind of a positive signal and kind of valuing what they are doing.  
**0:36:25-0:36:31:**  And I think there should be more communication and not only communication, but also connection  
**0:36:31-0:36:34:**  from brands to farmers to better understand each other.  
**0:36:34-0:36:39:**  It's really interesting how you're mentioning things that go beyond the financial incentives.  
**0:36:39-0:36:43:**  As we have heard many times today, a bit of a change in mindset and change in culture  
**0:36:43-0:36:45:**  that is necessary.  
**0:36:45-0:36:52:**  Of course, and I think that's not a simple task because human beings are used to comfort  
**0:36:52-0:36:53:**  zone.  
**0:36:53-0:36:56:**  We like our comfort zone because that's where if you're comfortable, so you have to leave  
**0:36:56-0:36:57:**  your comfort zone.  
**0:36:57-0:37:01:**  So the brands have to leave, corporates have to leave, but also farmers have to leave.  
**0:37:01-0:37:05:**  But farmers are reacting more positively if they have a role model, if they have a pioneering  
**0:37:05-0:37:11:**  farm in the area where they can really watch and see and really feel what's going on.  
**0:37:11-0:37:17:**  And at the end, farmers make decisions not based just on economic issues, but also on  
**0:37:17-0:37:18:**  culture.  
**0:37:18-0:37:24:**  And brands need to understand better what's the culture of a farming system in a specific  
**0:37:24-0:37:29:**  context and take that into account and find ways how to connect really with people and  
**0:37:29-0:37:31:**  not just communicate, but to connect.  
**0:37:31-0:37:32:**  That's the bottom line.  
**0:37:32-0:37:33:**  Fantastic.  
**0:37:33-0:37:37:**  Daniel, thank you so much for sharing with us your experience here.  
**0:37:37-0:37:40:**  And maybe for our listeners that want to know more about your work, what could they find  
**0:37:40-0:37:41:**  out?  
**0:37:41-0:37:43:**  Yeah, I'm on LinkedIn.  
**0:37:43-0:37:46:**  So if I'm on LinkedIn, I'm posting regularly if you want to follow me.  
**0:37:46-0:37:51:**  And I've written a small book, easy to read, 88 pages.  
**0:37:51-0:37:54:**  My goal was that everybody can read it and get some understanding on the server agriculture.  
**0:37:54-0:37:58:**  It's called Feeding the Earth.  
**0:37:58-0:38:02:**  And in French, it's called Nouris Latteur.  
**0:38:02-0:38:03:**  Thank you.  
**0:38:03-0:38:04:**  Thank you so much.  
**0:38:04-0:38:06:**  Thanks so much.  
**0:38:06-0:38:07:**  Hello.  
**0:38:07-0:38:11:**  And today we are with Bastien from Earthworm Foundation that's coming to talk to us a bit  
**0:38:11-0:38:13:**  about scaling regenerative agriculture.  
**0:38:13-0:38:14:**  Hi, Bastien.  
**0:38:14-0:38:18:**  And maybe we could just start by you telling us a bit about your work, a bit about Earthworm  
**0:38:18-0:38:20:**  Foundation as well.  
**0:38:20-0:38:22:**  Hello, Dimitri and Reza.  
**0:38:22-0:38:25:**  Thanks for inviting me.  
**0:38:25-0:38:30:**  Basically Earthworm Foundation is a not-for-profit organization, a Swiss foundation that has  
**0:38:30-0:38:35:**  been working for 20 years with the objective to regenerate soils and forests.  
**0:38:35-0:38:40:**  And the way we do it is by working with companies that are buying the raw materials eventually  
**0:38:40-0:38:45:**  on the downstream, you know, the big brands or smaller brands that want to transform.  
**0:38:45-0:38:49:**  And they want to have a positive impact on forests, on soils, and of course on the people  
**0:38:49-0:38:51:**  who live in rural areas.  
**0:38:51-0:38:55:**  And so we started working on the timber initially in the forest.  
**0:38:55-0:39:01:**  So we are very close to the forest originally and we've helped working with lots of companies  
**0:39:01-0:39:06:**  that were putting wood on the market and transformed the way forests were managed.  
**0:39:06-0:39:11:**  We did that and helped many forest and tropical countries become FSC certified.  
**0:39:11-0:39:16:**  And then little by little we worked on all the raw materials that have a negative impact  
**0:39:16-0:39:17:**  on the forest.  
**0:39:17-0:39:20:**  Palm oil, soybean, cocoa, rubber.  
**0:39:20-0:39:27:**  And then more recently we realized that eventually the key thing is to work with farmers and  
**0:39:27-0:39:28:**  their soils.  
**0:39:28-0:39:32:**  And so that's how we've gone into much more agriculture in the last 10 years.  
**0:39:32-0:39:36:**  Maybe you could tell us a bit more about how Earthworm Foundation is collaborating with  
**0:39:36-0:39:39:**  these industry leaders in order to facilitate a transition.  
**0:39:39-0:39:44:**  I mean we heard a fascinating talk about your work with Nestlé and maybe we can use that  
**0:39:44-0:39:45:**  as a case study.  
**0:39:45-0:39:46:**  Yes.  
**0:39:46-0:39:51:**  So what we, where we start with companies is always on their values, you could call  
**0:39:51-0:39:52:**  it policies.  
**0:39:52-0:39:54:**  What do you want to achieve?  
**0:39:54-0:40:00:**  So it's basically their sourcing policy where they will put down in their sourcing guidelines  
**0:40:00-0:40:03:**  what is it that they want exactly.  
**0:40:03-0:40:08:**  And what we realize is that when you talk about the kind of forest management that you  
**0:40:08-0:40:14:**  want or the kind of agricultural management that you want, you don't find often something  
**0:40:14-0:40:16:**  very clear or clear definition.  
**0:40:16-0:40:18:**  What is regenerative?  
**0:40:18-0:40:21:**  What is sustainable forestry?  
**0:40:21-0:40:26:**  You have a few principles but they are not always compiled into what could be a sourcing  
**0:40:26-0:40:27:**  policy.  
**0:40:27-0:40:32:**  So we built on the experience that we had on forests where we basically helped craft  
**0:40:32-0:40:38:**  the no deforestation policy by really getting down with scientists and creating a methodology  
**0:40:38-0:40:41:**  to say what is a forest and what is not a forest.  
**0:40:41-0:40:45:**  And if you look on Wikipedia you've got a massive definition of what is a forest but  
**0:40:45-0:40:47:**  it's not something practical.  
**0:40:47-0:40:52:**  And you think about the guys who are opening forests in Asia or in Africa and you have  
**0:40:52-0:40:57:**  on one side the big industries that think forests, in the past we had that in 2010,  
**0:40:57-0:41:03:**  the big industries that think forests is just a little bit on the hills and you can clear  
**0:41:03-0:41:09:**  everything and you've got activist NGOs like Greenpeace, like any piece of wood is forest.  
**0:41:09-0:41:13:**  And so everyone was stuck without a solution to figure out, okay, how do we define forests  
**0:41:13-0:41:17:**  and how do we develop economically why conserving nature.  
**0:41:17-0:41:21:**  So we developed a methodology called the high carbon stock forest methodology, you can find  
**0:41:21-0:41:27:**  it on the internet, highcarbonstock.org, which is a methodology that is now used by Amsterdam  
**0:41:27-0:41:33:**  declaration, New York declaration on forests, all the company policies and that helps companies  
**0:41:33-0:41:40:**  and investors and anyone basically even operators define how to manage forests in a development  
**0:41:40-0:41:43:**  context.  
**0:41:43-0:41:49:**  We are looking at doing the same thing for soils, so basically our regenerative agriculture,  
**0:41:49-0:41:52:**  what is a healthy soil, how do you measure it.  
**0:41:52-0:41:57:**  And to do that always what we try to do is to get in touch with scientists or practitioners  
**0:41:57-0:42:03:**  and practitioners so that we don't end up with something that is very researchy and  
**0:42:03-0:42:07:**  difficult to understand and then we bring them together and we said, how would you do  
**0:42:07-0:42:10:**  it in practice, we even get the farmers involved.  
**0:42:10-0:42:15:**  So we create a small scientific committee for example to do that and then we test tools  
**0:42:15-0:42:22:**  or indicators that allow us to measure soil health in a way that is scientifically correct  
**0:42:22-0:42:24:**  and practical.  
**0:42:24-0:42:28:**  And then we make sure that these definitions can be inserted into sourcing policies so  
**0:42:28-0:42:32:**  that when a company says, I want a raw material like that, it sends an instruction to the  
**0:42:32-0:42:38:**  upstream, to the producers that is something that they can do and that makes sense in terms  
**0:42:38-0:42:43:**  of indicators and guiding and measurement.  
**0:42:43-0:42:48:**  So the next step, so this is really the policy step, the next step to help companies is to  
**0:42:48-0:42:53:**  figure out where and who produces their raw materials.  
**0:42:53-0:42:58:**  So you have companies like Nestle, Ferrero, etcetera, they source from multiple origins,  
**0:42:58-0:43:04:**  multiple suppliers and for many years through the commoditization of their supplies or their  
**0:43:04-0:43:09:**  procurement they don't always know where it comes from, they don't know the farmer who  
**0:43:09-0:43:10:**  produces it.  
**0:43:10-0:43:14:**  So the next step really is to get to meet the suppliers and get to know the farmers  
**0:43:14-0:43:16:**  who are producing.  
**0:43:16-0:43:21:**  And we look there, how are you doing in terms of production, are you far away from what  
**0:43:21-0:43:27:**  is expected in terms of responsible production or not?  
**0:43:27-0:43:31:**  And then we can look at always you've got farmers that are producers that are really  
**0:43:31-0:43:34:**  well advanced and others that are lagging behind.  
**0:43:34-0:43:38:**  And the idea is how to help and support the ones that are lagging behind and reward those  
**0:43:38-0:43:41:**  who are performing well.  
**0:43:41-0:43:45:**  So the third pillar of our action is really the transformation and that's where we mobilize  
**0:43:45-0:43:52:**  people in the field but not just our people, we also partner with lots of institutes, associations,  
**0:43:52-0:43:56:**  experts, people who have done that sometimes for years, agroforestry specialists like we're  
**0:43:56-0:44:04:**  doing in France with Le Planteur Volontaire or various associations where we bring them  
**0:44:04-0:44:10:**  in in a favorable context where the supply chain, the producers, the buyers are all demanding  
**0:44:10-0:44:13:**  their expertise so they can come in and work with the farmers and there is funding for  
**0:44:13-0:44:14:**  that etc.  
**0:44:14-0:44:19:**  And eventually the last part is to verify because the verification of that eventually  
**0:44:19-0:44:25:**  you know this forest is still standing, that soil is healthy is what will allow the whole  
**0:44:25-0:44:31:**  supply chain to reward financially the farmers and the producers with premiums, with longer  
**0:44:31-0:44:37:**  term contracts, somehow de-commoditizing the supply chain and creating this long term relationship  
**0:44:37-0:44:43:**  between a farmer who produces raw materials and then a buyer who is tied to a level of  
**0:44:43-0:44:49:**  quality that this farmer can produce for him, helping him meet the climate objectives etc.  
**0:44:49-0:44:54:**  Well that's a really really elaborate and eloquent explanation of what you're doing,  
**0:44:54-0:44:56:**  it's very interesting.  
**0:44:56-0:45:01:**  And you know one of the things that came to mind is linked to, there's a certain cost  
**0:45:01-0:45:08:**  to this transition and it can be experienced by the farmer, especially by the farmer and  
**0:45:08-0:45:12:**  a sudden risk as well associated with the regenerative agriculture transition and what  
**0:45:12-0:45:20:**  I wanted to know is when you're working with these corporate industry leaders, you know  
**0:45:20-0:45:25:**  who is paying for this transition, who is reducing the risk to the farmers if it is  
**0:45:25-0:45:29:**  actually happening, how does it play out economically?  
**0:45:29-0:45:37:**  So I would say two things, the first one is our work, a bit like a coach or you know fitness  
**0:45:37-0:45:44:**  coach who would pay to help to get fit, we get paid by the brands mostly that said okay  
**0:45:44-0:45:51:**  we want to change, we need help, we have decided to invest in our change journey, we need partners  
**0:45:51-0:45:56:**  to help us, so a lot of our funding comes from brands who hire us or work with us so  
**0:45:56-0:46:00:**  we can help them transform.  
**0:46:00-0:46:06:**  Then the real cost of transformation, I would put it more as a real risk of transformation  
**0:46:06-0:46:11:**  because today many supply chain kind of function, you know they deliver raw materials to the  
**0:46:11-0:46:17:**  consumer and that's okay, the thing is we know we are extracting capital from soils,  
**0:46:17-0:46:22:**  from people and that cannot be done forever, so at some stage we need to change the course  
**0:46:22-0:46:24:**  of things.  
**0:46:24-0:46:28:**  The thing is when everyone comes to the farmer saying you need to change the course of things,  
**0:46:28-0:46:34:**  the farmer is thinking yeah nice I will try but if he fails he's the only one paying the  
**0:46:34-0:46:39:**  cost, so if I'm a farmer and I'm trying something, let's say putting trees in my field, I will  
**0:46:39-0:46:44:**  maybe lose some production, maybe I don't know if it's the right trees etc and I'm the  
**0:46:44-0:46:48:**  only one paying for it if it fails, if it doesn't bring something positive to me as  
**0:46:48-0:46:53:**  everyone promised and then there's no one to come back to the farmer and say oh poor  
**0:46:53-0:46:57:**  you, you've lost some years, I'm going to compensate you, it's not happening.  
**0:46:57-0:47:04:**  So what we believe is the need to share the risk of the transition, the transition is  
**0:47:04-0:47:08:**  beneficial for everyone, we know you can have savings by working more with nature, nature  
**0:47:08-0:47:14:**  can do things for you that will save you fuel, cost, chemicals but to get to that point you  
**0:47:14-0:47:21:**  need to take a leap of faith and to do that we believe the whole supply chain but also  
**0:47:21-0:47:27:**  the governments have an opportunity to come and support, so support with technical expertise  
**0:47:27-0:47:36:**  etc but also support by investing a bit, paying some rewards, supporting with assistance funds,  
**0:47:36-0:47:39:**  some kind of subsidies as well from the state.  
**0:47:39-0:47:44:**  I think all the actors that have an interest in seeing the farmer succeed can all take  
**0:47:44-0:47:48:**  a little bit of their share of the challenge, investors as well, they can put money on the  
**0:47:48-0:47:53:**  table saying I am funding you to do your transition and if it doesn't work maybe I don't recoup  
**0:47:53-0:47:57:**  my money but that's the kind of attitude that we're looking for.  
**0:47:57-0:48:05:**  So we're talking to governments, regional governments, brands of course, insurance companies,  
**0:48:05-0:48:10:**  investors and then ecosystem services, finances who could come and bring some reward as well  
**0:48:10-0:48:16:**  for the work done and I believe all of them have the opportunity to take a little bit  
**0:48:16-0:48:21:**  of the share, a piece of the backpack on their back to support the farmer.  
**0:48:21-0:48:25:**  And is this something that you're seeing being played out in practice?  
**0:48:25-0:48:30:**  So the big challenge to do that is that we need to put the actors around the same table  
**0:48:30-0:48:39:**  so that they are comfortable, that each is doing kind of their part because what a big  
**0:48:39-0:48:43:**  brand doesn't want to do is to take the whole transformation on its own and then the other  
**0:48:43-0:48:47:**  brands are kind of waiting for the farmer to transform and when the farmer is transformed  
**0:48:47-0:48:53:**  now we can buy from him but we haven't invested in the transformation which fair enough but  
**0:48:53-0:48:58:**  it leads to potential everyone watching each other.  
**0:48:58-0:49:04:**  So the idea is to really proactively around concrete projects, mobilize and for me concrete  
**0:49:04-0:49:08:**  projects are like being sitting around the table and saying okay we're going to transform  
**0:49:08-0:49:12:**  so many farmers with so many suppliers etc.  
**0:49:12-0:49:16:**  What do you put in and if you put in that I can put in that as well and basically everyone  
**0:49:16-0:49:17:**  does its share.  
**0:49:17-0:49:22:**  So we organize that mostly around the rotation of the crops so you know a farmer will produce  
**0:49:22-0:49:30:**  I don't know canola, beetroot in temperate regions, canola, beetroot, wheat and barley.  
**0:49:30-0:49:36:**  Let's take an actor from each raw material to come in and to support so that's one option.  
**0:49:36-0:49:40:**  The other thing that but it's valid in tropical regions as well.  
**0:49:40-0:49:46:**  We work in places where you've got palm, cocoa, you've got nutmeg, you've got vetiver, you've  
**0:49:46-0:49:49:**  got different you know products being produced.  
**0:49:49-0:49:55:**  If you bring all the raw material supply chains and the actors that have a stake in that landscape  
**0:49:55-0:50:00:**  they can all contribute to the transition to the replanting to piloting new systems  
**0:50:00-0:50:03:**  in agroforestry in particular.  
**0:50:03-0:50:05:**  Very interesting.  
**0:50:05-0:50:09:**  One of the other questions I had for you is what are some of the key challenges that you're  
**0:50:09-0:50:15:**  seeing to be able to implement and scale regenerative agriculture and throughout the supply chain?  
**0:50:15-0:50:17:**  Is it coming more from the farmer side?  
**0:50:17-0:50:19:**  Is it coming more from the corporate side?  
**0:50:19-0:50:22:**  What are some of the most difficult things to overcome?  
**0:50:22-0:50:24:**  I think there are a few.  
**0:50:24-0:50:26:**  I would not be able to point to one.  
**0:50:26-0:50:29:**  I think I will come back to the risk.  
**0:50:29-0:50:34:**  The fact that today the risk is mostly taken by the farmer and if I'm a farmer, let's say  
**0:50:34-0:50:40:**  I'm 50, my kids are in school or in university, I've got already loans.  
**0:50:40-0:50:44:**  Why would I radically change something that has been kind of functioning up to now?  
**0:50:44-0:50:51:**  So giving the appetite to risk and being able to share that risk for me is absolutely key.  
**0:50:51-0:50:56:**  To be able to do that, the second obstacle is manage the egos and the view that people  
**0:50:56-0:50:59:**  have of solving a problem.  
**0:50:59-0:51:03:**  Thinking that either I do it myself or I let the others do it, maybe we can all do a little  
**0:51:03-0:51:10:**  bit and that means being open and being able to talk to other entities.  
**0:51:10-0:51:15:**  So private talking to the public, brands talking between each other, brands talking to their  
**0:51:15-0:51:16:**  suppliers.  
**0:51:16-0:51:22:**  In another relationship that one cannot get from you, which is sometimes you take a supplier  
**0:51:22-0:51:28:**  and a brand, they're always discussing commercially every cent of the price.  
**0:51:28-0:51:31:**  What can we do else than just fighting on price?  
**0:51:31-0:51:33:**  What are the things that we can build together?  
**0:51:33-0:51:36:**  And this is this attitude that I think is needed.  
**0:51:36-0:51:42:**  And if you do that, then it allows to unlock key things that are missing, measurement,  
**0:51:42-0:51:43:**  finance.  
**0:51:43-0:51:48:**  For me these are almost sub-products of the collaboration that we can create.  
**0:51:48-0:51:49:**  Amazing.  
**0:51:49-0:51:55:**  Bastien, thank you so much for explaining and elaborating on your work.  
**0:51:55-0:52:00:**  Maybe you could tell us a bit about where our listeners could find out more about your  
**0:52:00-0:52:01:**  work if they wanted to.  
**0:52:01-0:52:03:**  So thanks a lot, a pleasure.  
**0:52:03-0:52:07:**  They can go on earthworm.org, which is our main website.  
**0:52:07-0:52:15:**  We have also a page called Solvivant in French,.org, always an S at the end of Sol and Vivant.  
**0:52:15-0:52:16:**  And that's it.  
**0:52:16-0:52:18:**  And there you can find different projects.  
**0:52:18-0:52:21:**  And of course, if they want to know more, they can get in touch with us.  
**0:52:21-0:52:22:**  Fantastic.  
**0:52:22-0:52:23:**  Thank you so much.  
**0:52:23-0:52:24:**  Thank you.  
**0:52:24-0:52:25:**  Hello, Charles.  
**0:52:25-0:52:27:**  So Charles is joining us now.  
**0:52:27-0:52:33:**  Charles Leonardi is joining us from Nestlé, France to talk about the work of Nestlé and  
**0:52:33-0:52:34:**  regenerative agriculture.  
**0:52:34-0:52:38:**  So maybe, Charles, you could give us a bit of an introduction of yourself and what you're  
**0:52:38-0:52:39:**  doing at Nestlé, France.  
**0:52:39-0:52:40:**  It's a pleasure.  
**0:52:40-0:52:41:**  Thank you.  
**0:52:41-0:52:43:**  Thank you, Dimitri.  
**0:52:43-0:52:44:**  So I'm Charles.  
**0:52:44-0:52:48:**  I'm the head of supply chain for Nestlé in France.  
**0:52:48-0:52:56:**  That means I'm covering the value chain from procurement to the delivery of finished goods.  
**0:52:56-0:53:03:**  And in France, in fact, Nestlé is very much present industrially.  
**0:53:03-0:53:06:**  So we have 17 factories.  
**0:53:06-0:53:13:**  We are sourcing one million tons of raw materials, out of which 700,000 are raw materials which  
**0:53:13-0:53:15:**  are produced in France.  
**0:53:15-0:53:19:**  So we have an important footprint.  
**0:53:19-0:53:25:**  And therefore, we are very close to our suppliers and farmers.  
**0:53:25-0:53:29:**  And therefore, regenerative agriculture is very important for us.  
**0:53:29-0:53:33:**  And if I understand correctly, Nestlé has made a very big commitment to regenerative  
**0:53:33-0:53:34:**  agriculture.  
**0:53:34-0:53:35:**  So maybe you could tell us a bit about that.  
**0:53:35-0:53:36:**  Yeah, that's correct.  
**0:53:36-0:53:38:**  So we have a very big ambition.  
**0:53:38-0:53:47:**  So we want to have 20 percent of our sourcing, which is regenerative agriculture by 2025,  
**0:53:47-0:53:49:**  and 50 percent by 2030.  
**0:53:49-0:53:54:**  So it's a huge ambition, and it's a very stretched target.  
**0:53:54-0:54:02:**  But we believe it's the right thing to do for our climate, and we have to do it.  
**0:54:02-0:54:03:**  Very interesting.  
**0:54:03-0:54:09:**  So the first question that we have, and this was of course discussed in our previous talk,  
**0:54:09-0:54:13:**  in the talk that you did earlier on with Earthworm Foundation, who we just interviewed before,  
**0:54:13-0:54:19:**  was about, you know, I'd love for you to explain to our listeners how you're integrating regenerative  
**0:54:19-0:54:21:**  agriculture in your supply chain.  
**0:54:21-0:54:23:**  And what's your strategy around that?  
**0:54:23-0:54:28:**  How are you going to actually reach your commitments to regenerative agriculture?  
**0:54:28-0:54:32:**  So first of all, we are not the ones really doing.  
**0:54:32-0:54:35:**  In fact, we have to work with the farmers.  
**0:54:35-0:54:39:**  The farmers are the ones really who are the most involved with the soil.  
**0:54:39-0:54:45:**  So what we are trying to do is, as much as possible, to support them to do this huge  
**0:54:45-0:54:51:**  transition and to go towards this regenerative agriculture.  
**0:54:51-0:54:58:**  So we are listening a lot to our suppliers and to our farmers, and we are trying to understand  
**0:54:58-0:55:05:**  what is the most important for them so that we can support in this effort.  
**0:55:05-0:55:13:**  So if I would summarize the two biggest, most important topics, one is the knowledge and  
**0:55:13-0:55:18:**  what type of expertise, what type of sharing, what type of trainings we can work with the  
**0:55:18-0:55:19:**  farmers on.  
**0:55:19-0:55:29:**  And the second part is the risk and the cost impact and the incentive we can try to give  
**0:55:29-0:55:33:**  to them in order to support this transition.  
**0:55:33-0:55:39:**  So we are, on one side, we don't have all the knowledge, definitely, so we are trying  
**0:55:39-0:55:43:**  to find the best ecosystem, the best experts.  
**0:55:43-0:55:50:**  The FITI Earthworm Foundation is a big partner for us to create this ecosystem of knowledge.  
**0:55:50-0:55:57:**  And we are working, thanks to them also, with some other partners like IcoSystem in France,  
**0:55:57-0:56:00:**  with specialists in training of the farmers, etc.  
**0:56:00-0:56:06:**  So this is one part, and then this is not enough, because if we only come with knowledge  
**0:56:06-0:56:14:**  and training or expertise or measures, we touch generally, and this is what we did a  
**0:56:14-0:56:18:**  few years ago, we touch the pioneers, so the ones who are already very much committed and  
**0:56:18-0:56:23:**  want to do it, but we don't reach enough to bring the percentage higher.  
**0:56:23-0:56:29:**  And this is where there needs to be an additional incentive, and we need to come also with some  
**0:56:29-0:56:36:**  financial incentives and some premiums typically in order to accelerate the move.  
**0:56:36-0:56:38:**  Fantastic, that's very interesting.  
**0:56:38-0:56:43:**  So you've already started to explain a bit here, but it would be great to elaborate a  
**0:56:43-0:56:47:**  bit more on how you're interacting with the farmers in this transition.  
**0:56:47-0:56:53:**  Are you always going through another specialized company or foundation like Earthworm, or are  
**0:56:53-0:56:58:**  you having some direct interactions with farmers through the supply of the raw material?  
**0:56:58-0:57:06:**  Yeah, so our supply chain in France, and this is not the same in all countries, we have  
**0:57:06-0:57:12:**  some countries like in developing markets, on cocoa, on coffee, where we are much, much  
**0:57:12-0:57:15:**  more in direct touch directly with the farmers.  
**0:57:15-0:57:23:**  In France, we are working a lot with cooperatives, and with our suppliers are the ones who are  
**0:57:23-0:57:27:**  more in touch with the farmers.  
**0:57:27-0:57:31:**  And it's very important for us, in fact, because our supply chain is designed like that, it's  
**0:57:31-0:57:38:**  very important that we onboard also the cooperatives, that we have the same directions, same vision,  
**0:57:38-0:57:42:**  we share the ambition, and also that they are part of the solution.  
**0:57:42-0:57:49:**  Because if we try to convince the farmers ourselves, but we are not consistent with  
**0:57:49-0:57:55:**  what our suppliers are working on with them, we cannot achieve it in France.  
**0:57:55-0:58:04:**  So yes, generally it is the suppliers, the farmers, ourselves, and then around that,  
**0:58:04-0:58:10:**  an ecosystem of specialized companies who will bring different types of expertise.  
**0:58:10-0:58:15:**  One would be training, another one would be measure, another one would be, and this is  
**0:58:15-0:58:19:**  this whole ecosystem that we are trying to co-design now, and that we are working on  
**0:58:19-0:58:26:**  in France, in what we call the originally Living Soil Project, because everything started  
**0:58:26-0:58:32:**  with the soil, and which we are now coding more and more regenerative agriculture.  
**0:58:32-0:58:33:**  Very interesting.  
**0:58:33-0:58:37:**  And I'm curious as to what stage are you at at the moment?  
**0:58:37-0:58:42:**  Have you already worked out this model and the key partners to create this transition,  
**0:58:42-0:58:43:**  or where are you at?  
**0:58:43-0:58:48:**  I think we will never have finished, so we are really in a building mode, and we'll continue  
**0:58:48-0:58:50:**  learning by doing, etc.  
**0:58:50-0:59:00:**  We start to have some scale, so last year we reached 10 suppliers already, and last  
**0:59:00-0:59:09:**  year we were able to already work with 200 farmers, really engaged, involved, doing trainings  
**0:59:09-0:59:16:**  with us, and starting the measurement, which is very important in this transition.  
**0:59:16-0:59:22:**  So getting a training, getting the first measures, and being involved with us on longer term  
**0:59:22-0:59:27:**  engagement, longer term commitment, to go forward in this transition.  
**0:59:27-0:59:34:**  So we start to have some scale, and the ecosystem to support this scale is getting built at  
**0:59:34-0:59:42:**  the moment, and the more it goes, the more we try to bring other companies with us, other  
**0:59:42-0:59:49:**  suppliers, other food companies, other stakeholders, because we will not do it alone.  
**0:59:49-0:59:52:**  One of the things in your talk earlier on that we were listening to that I thought was  
**0:59:52-0:59:57:**  fascinating is that you were mentioning the need to collaborate with competitors in the  
**0:59:57-1:00:01:**  field, and so maybe you could tell us a bit about why you're needing to collaborate with  
**1:00:01-1:00:07:**  some competitors, and why does the regenerative agriculture transition require a community  
**1:00:07-1:00:09:**  to work together, which is something that's quite fascinating.  
**1:00:09-1:00:10:**  Thank you.  
**1:00:10-1:00:18:**  So this is difficult, very difficult part, because after 25 years in supply chain, in  
**1:00:18-1:00:25:**  Nestlé, and always competition is important for us, it's the first time these past years,  
**1:00:25-1:00:30:**  the first time that I'm sitting around the table with my competitors, and it's not easy,  
**1:00:30-1:00:37:**  but we need to do it, and why we need to do it is because, again, we listen to the farmers  
**1:00:37-1:00:43:**  and our suppliers, we try to understand how we can help them, and one part where we can  
**1:00:43-1:00:49:**  help them is to be consistent in the industry of what we are asking them, and if we are  
**1:00:49-1:00:54:**  not coming, we have to simplify the life, we have to simplify the life of the farmers,  
**1:00:54-1:01:00:**  if they have one day in Nestlé, another day, another one coming with a different framework,  
**1:01:00-1:01:04:**  and the third day, a third one coming with a different framework and different asks,  
**1:01:04-1:01:09:**  they will not be able to manage, it will be too complex, and at a certain point of time,  
**1:01:09-1:01:10:**  they may even give up.  
**1:01:10-1:01:17:**  So we have a role to play to align, because all of us, we have to move, all of us, I think  
**1:01:17-1:01:22:**  we are convinced that this is a way, we need to transition, and we need to help the ones  
**1:01:22-1:01:27:**  who will do, and the ones who will do are the farmers, and this is why I'm trying to  
**1:01:27-1:01:31:**  convince my competitors also to sit around the table.  
**1:01:31-1:01:38:**  We are open to update the framework, to take some other things into consideration we may  
**1:01:38-1:01:43:**  not have put immediately, but it's very important for the farmers that we are all aligned on  
**1:01:43-1:01:46:**  what we ask them, and how we support.  
**1:01:46-1:01:48:**  So, yeah, this is...  
**1:01:48-1:01:52:**  No, no, that's great, that's a very clear answer, thanks for that.  
**1:01:52-1:01:56:**  And you know, we're talking about this transition, we're talking about the farmers, that they  
**1:01:56-1:02:02:**  are going to be implementing this in the field, and that's going to incur certain transition  
**1:02:02-1:02:05:**  costs, which is a theme that's been coming out a lot in these talks that we've been listening  
**1:02:05-1:02:07:**  to at the moment.  
**1:02:07-1:02:12:**  And so I was wondering, how is Nestlé, how is Nestlé helping the farmers in this transition?  
**1:02:12-1:02:17:**  Is Nestlé assuming these costs, or how are you distributing the financial burden of a  
**1:02:17-1:02:20:**  regenerative transition?  
**1:02:20-1:02:26:**  So what we started doing, the first thing we did was to bring some expertise, so we  
**1:02:26-1:02:33:**  paid for experts like Earthworm Foundation, like Ecosystem, all the satellite data we  
**1:02:33-1:02:35:**  are trying to gather, etc.  
**1:02:35-1:02:43:**  So all the expertise, training that we wanted to bring, we took the cost on our shoulders,  
**1:02:43-1:02:48:**  and we said, okay, it's our part, and we do it.  
**1:02:48-1:02:53:**  Then we found out, if we just do that, which is already a big investment, to be honest,  
**1:02:53-1:02:59:**  but if we only do that, it will not be enough to accelerate and to go to the ambition, huge  
**1:02:59-1:03:01:**  ambition we are trying to get.  
**1:03:01-1:03:08:**  And this is where we decided, in fact, to give an incentive.  
**1:03:08-1:03:14:**  And this incentive is very difficult to say if we cover all the additional costs or if  
**1:03:14-1:03:22:**  we cover the risks or whatever, but it has to be sufficiently consistent to be already  
**1:03:22-1:03:26:**  something motivating, and also it has to be gradual.  
**1:03:26-1:03:30:**  So it has to start from the beginning, so from the beginning, for the people who get  
**1:03:30-1:03:37:**  involved, engaged, get the training, and in fact start the measures, we already gave a  
**1:03:37-1:03:38:**  first incentive.  
**1:03:38-1:03:43:**  Then there is a second step, when people change practices, we give an additional incentive.  
**1:03:43-1:03:48:**  And then there is an additional step, when people start to get quantitative results in  
**1:03:48-1:03:54:**  the soil, soil fertility, or soil carbon, etc. and then we give an additional incentive.  
**1:03:54-1:04:00:**  So we made a gradual incentive, so that we start from the beginning with something, and  
**1:04:00-1:04:05:**  that the more you advance and the more in fact you get involved, and the more you put  
**1:04:05-1:04:11:**  money or risk on the table, and the more we gradually give additional incentive to the  
**1:04:11-1:04:12:**  farm.  
**1:04:12-1:04:17:**  So this is how we try to build and try to do it as fair as possible.  
**1:04:17-1:04:23:**  In this incentive system that you've created, you see that as being able to scale to the  
**1:04:23-1:04:30:**  50 or 100% of the farmers that you're working with, or you're seeing it as an incentive  
**1:04:30-1:04:33:**  system that's specialized for the pioneers?  
**1:04:33-1:04:38:**  So the pioneers, honestly, they didn't even need us in fact.  
**1:04:38-1:04:43:**  They were already convinced, they did a lot without us, to be honest.  
**1:04:43-1:04:47:**  But they were of course happy to get additional expertise and they were happy to get additional  
**1:04:47-1:04:49:**  food.  
**1:04:49-1:04:56:**  Now the fact that we started to give this additional incentive I was speaking about  
**1:04:56-1:05:01:**  helped us to go from these pioneers to more scale.  
**1:05:01-1:05:10:**  And typically 200 in one year was not easy to get 200 farmers to be engaged in our program.  
**1:05:10-1:05:16:**  But still it happened I think a lot because we were ready to put some money on the table  
**1:05:16-1:05:17:**  and to give this incentive.  
**1:05:17-1:05:26:**  Now on top of this incentive to go from 20 to 50, I think it will be much easier in a  
**1:05:26-1:05:32:**  sense than to go from 0 to 20 because people will start seeing the first results of the  
**1:05:32-1:05:38:**  0 to 20 and they will start having their peers, their colleagues showing what it brought to  
**1:05:38-1:05:45:**  them, why they're happy about the change, why they are more resilient, why etc. etc.  
**1:05:45-1:05:50:**  And then the more testimonies you will have and the more proof points you will have, the  
**1:05:50-1:05:51:**  easier it will be.  
**1:05:51-1:05:55:**  But of course the incentive will remain important for us to put on the table.  
**1:05:55-1:05:57:**  That's very very interesting.  
**1:05:57-1:06:03:**  The final question that I have for you is what are some of the biggest challenges that  
**1:06:03-1:06:07:**  you've had to overcome in order to create this regenerative transition to onboard the  
**1:06:07-1:06:11:**  farmers to convince, I don't know exactly where it could have come from, but what are  
**1:06:11-1:06:15:**  some of the biggest challenges you're facing to reach the commitments that you've made?  
**1:06:15-1:06:21:**  That's a very big question because we had a lot of changes I must say.  
**1:06:21-1:06:28:**  It's not easy because you have to work with people and you ask people to make a big big  
**1:06:28-1:06:31:**  change and there are a lot of fears behind this change etc.  
**1:06:31-1:06:41:**  A big part is how you bring people for this change management and to trust you that you  
**1:06:41-1:06:46:**  bring them on a positive path.  
**1:06:46-1:06:51:**  How to onboard the farmers was really one of our biggest concerns and how we can make  
**1:06:51-1:06:52:**  it etc.  
**1:06:52-1:06:58:**  The other part was how you convince the business to invest and how you make sure that everybody  
**1:06:58-1:07:02:**  is behind you within the company.  
**1:07:02-1:07:09:**  Here I must say the ambition that the group has put and that our CEO has put to give very  
**1:07:09-1:07:15:**  big and strong and very ambitious targets has helped us a lot because then it was very  
**1:07:15-1:07:17:**  clear that we had to do it.  
**1:07:17-1:07:22:**  There needs to be an ambition coming from the top and I think this was very very helpful  
**1:07:22-1:07:23:**  in our transition.  
**1:07:23-1:07:33:**  I would say one other thing is that one of the changes is not to get disrupted by short  
**1:07:33-1:07:35:**  term issues.  
**1:07:35-1:07:41:**  Every year one day you have Covid, another day you have Ukraine and the impact on commodities,  
**1:07:41-1:07:45:**  another day you have weather impact etc.  
**1:07:45-1:07:50:**  You should keep the focus on we have to continue our vision, we have to continue our ambition  
**1:07:50-1:07:54:**  and you should not get distracted by the short term issues.  
**1:07:54-1:08:00:**  The big picture is more important than the short term hurdles and this is across the  
**1:08:00-1:08:01:**  chain.  
**1:08:01-1:08:07:**  Farmers can also be tempted to say let's wait for next year because this year we have to  
**1:08:07-1:08:13:**  put as much volume as possible because the wide year to send big volumes etc.  
**1:08:13-1:08:18:**  We as well we can have some other concerns so we have to keep this focus.  
**1:08:18-1:08:24:**  I would say the last point and last point is last challenge is as you were saying we  
**1:08:24-1:08:32:**  need to bring around the table people who are not used to work together and institutions,  
**1:08:32-1:08:41:**  authorities, scientific, farmers, suppliers and at the end competitors making sure that  
**1:08:41-1:08:46:**  we are all aligned on what we want to do, how we want to do, we help each other and  
**1:08:46-1:08:52:**  we also see that the bigger picture is more important than the rest.  
**1:08:52-1:09:02:**  And I think we learn at the moment to work totally differently, no longer in a pure competitive  
**1:09:02-1:09:04:**  mode but in a coalition mode.  
**1:09:04-1:09:11:**  And I think for all of us it's a learning but I think we start to have quite positive  
**1:09:11-1:09:13:**  first success stories.  
**1:09:13-1:09:16:**  And I hope we could share this morning part of it.  
**1:09:16-1:09:20:**  This morning was definitely very interesting and I cannot resist the temptation to ask  
**1:09:20-1:09:24:**  one last thing because you're giving me some very interesting elements and answers here  
**1:09:24-1:09:27:**  which I know our listeners will love.  
**1:09:27-1:09:32:**  What is the value that Nestle sees in regenerative agriculture?  
**1:09:32-1:09:38:**  Why is Nestle taking such a massive commitment to regenerative agriculture?  
**1:09:38-1:09:46:**  So we were anyway already convinced that soil is super important for the sustainability  
**1:09:46-1:09:48:**  of the supply chain.  
**1:09:48-1:09:54:**  We were losing soil, if we want to continue being able to produce food in the future we  
**1:09:54-1:09:56:**  need soil.  
**1:09:56-1:10:00:**  So we were already convinced that in terms of disruption, risk of disruption, risk of  
**1:10:00-1:10:05:**  our supply chains we will have to protect the soil and we will have to work on this  
**1:10:05-1:10:08:**  topic and this is why we started several years ago.  
**1:10:08-1:10:13:**  Now on top of that it's more and more clear that if we want to reach our commitment in  
**1:10:13-1:10:20:**  terms of climate change and in terms of carbon and in terms of we need the soil to be also  
**1:10:20-1:10:22:**  part of the solution.  
**1:10:22-1:10:29:**  And in our carbon footprint, depending on the country in Nestle we have between 60 to  
**1:10:29-1:10:35:**  70 percent of our total carbon footprint which is in agriculture, which is on the upstream  
**1:10:35-1:10:36:**  side.  
**1:10:36-1:10:42:**  So if we want to be carbon neutral in the future, if we want to reach our net zero commitment  
**1:10:42-1:10:49:**  that we gave to ourselves for 2050 which is tomorrow, we cannot not work with the farmers  
**1:10:49-1:10:52:**  on soils and regenerative agriculture.  
**1:10:52-1:10:58:**  So I think it's now it's super clear within the company that not only it's a good idea  
**1:10:58-1:11:07:**  for supply continuity and business continuity but it's also very important for climate and  
**1:11:07-1:11:10:**  for the environment and overall.  
**1:11:10-1:11:14:**  So it's only a good idea in fact, we have to do it.  
**1:11:14-1:11:18:**  That's good to hear from our perspective as well, regenerative agriculture is a win-win  
**1:11:18-1:11:21:**  and a win-win-win possibly as well.  
**1:11:21-1:11:25:**  So thanks a lot for taking the time to talk with us today and what could our listeners  
**1:11:25-1:11:29:**  find out more about Nestle's commitment to regenerative agriculture?  
**1:11:29-1:11:39:**  Okay, so on our website you will find all our commitment in terms of the net zero footprint  
**1:11:39-1:11:46:**  strategy so how far we want, how fast we want to go there.  
**1:11:46-1:11:54:**  And yeah, I'm sure we'll continue to publish our progress and with a lot of humility because  
**1:11:54-1:11:57:**  we are continuing to learn a lot by doing so.  
**1:11:57-1:12:05:**  We'll continue hopefully by sharing, convincing others to join the road and to join the journey  
**1:12:05-1:12:07:**  which is a very important one.  
**1:12:07-1:12:09:**  Thank you so much Charles for taking the time to talk with us.  
**1:12:09-1:12:13:**  You're welcome, thank you Dimitri, it was a good exchange, thank you very much.  
**1:12:13-1:12:17:**  Hello Felix Jacobsen, thanks for coming on and for talking with us.  
**1:12:17-1:12:21:**  You're coming from KLEAM so maybe you could you know tell us a bit about yourself and  
**1:12:21-1:12:25:**  what KLEAM does and how it's related to regenerative agriculture.  
**1:12:25-1:12:29:**  Yes, hi, good to be here.  
**1:12:29-1:12:35:**  I work at KLEAM, KLEAM is a company based out of Berlin in Germany and we're really  
**1:12:35-1:12:41:**  focused on actually making regenerative agriculture or the transition to rag-egg scalable across  
**1:12:41-1:12:43:**  farmers in a very farmer-centric way.  
**1:12:43-1:12:47:**  So when we started a few years back we saw that a lot of the programs out there and a  
**1:12:47-1:12:53:**  lot of the things out there are a very prescriptive and b quite cumbersome on the farmer side.  
**1:12:53-1:12:59:**  So we really aimed at building something from the ground up looking at what do farmers need  
**1:12:59-1:13:07:**  and what that was for us was really, well it's transition finance obviously, it's  
**1:13:07-1:13:09:**  knowledge and it's also recognition.  
**1:13:09-1:13:14:**  So we think the combination of the connection between consumer and farmers in agriculture  
**1:13:14-1:13:18:**  is super super important and in making that transparent.  
**1:13:18-1:13:27:**  And out of that actually came an app that we built and launched in 2020 for farmers  
**1:13:27-1:13:33:**  supporting them, giving them a toolbox, enabling their decisions on what to do in order to  
**1:13:33-1:13:35:**  grow more regeneratively.  
**1:13:35-1:13:40:**  Fantastic, I'm very curious, you're going to have to break a bit, break down these things  
**1:13:40-1:13:46:**  that you've said and maybe help us to understand how does your app and your solution help to  
**1:13:46-1:13:52:**  train farmers, find educational, find transition finance and also connect to the customers.  
**1:13:52-1:13:54:**  How does that work out in practice?  
**1:13:54-1:13:59:**  So imagine you have a farm, you download our app, you set up your farm, you upload your  
**1:13:59-1:14:02:**  fields, you tell us about your crop rotation, about what you're going to do, it's your  
**1:14:02-1:14:03:**  baseline.  
**1:14:03-1:14:07:**  We, based on that, instantaneously offer you a bunch of different things that you could  
**1:14:07-1:14:13:**  be doing and that would work well for your certain fields within your crop rotation.  
**1:14:13-1:14:18:**  But at the end of the day you can choose what you want to take, really making your decisions  
**1:14:18-1:14:24:**  because I mean every farm is different, we do not have a one size fits all solution that  
**1:14:24-1:14:31:**  works everywhere and we don't tell you what exactly to do but what practice to apply.  
**1:14:31-1:14:37:**  And with that, talking transition finance or transition incentives, financial incentives,  
**1:14:37-1:14:43:**  we do have a certain amount of money that we will pay you after you successfully applied  
**1:14:43-1:14:46:**  these methods within your farm.  
**1:14:46-1:14:49:**  And where does that come from is probably the next question.  
**1:14:49-1:14:57:**  The only value that industry and or consumers are currently willing to pay is carbon sequestration  
**1:14:57-1:15:04:**  but also carbon reduction which is per definition permanent if you look at reduced fertilizer  
**1:15:04-1:15:07:**  usage and so on and so forth.  
**1:15:07-1:15:08:**  Fascinating, that's really interesting.  
**1:15:08-1:15:11:**  How many farmers are you working with at the moment?  
**1:15:11-1:15:17:**  So it's almost 2000 farmers just in the German speaking regions going to expand next year.  
**1:15:17-1:15:20:**  That's very positive, that's very exciting, it's many farmers.  
**1:15:20-1:15:27:**  And so based on that oversight that you're gaining, what are some of the key opportunities  
**1:15:27-1:15:31:**  that you're seeing the regenerative agriculture creates for farmers?  
**1:15:31-1:15:37:**  I mean this summer has been a very difficult summer for farmers which of course helps our  
**1:15:37-1:15:45:**  regenerative agenda as an industry but is difficult for the food ecosystem as a whole.  
**1:15:45-1:15:52:**  I do think the opportunity lies really around the overall ecosystem services and yield security  
**1:15:52-1:15:58:**  and supply chain resilience which helps farmers but ultimately also the farmers' buyers be  
**1:15:58-1:16:01:**  it consumers or large food corporates.  
**1:16:01-1:16:04:**  That makes a lot of sense, it's something that resonates with other things we've been  
**1:16:04-1:16:07:**  hearing around the conference and some of the interest that we're seeing from some of  
**1:16:07-1:16:11:**  the big buyers that are here with us in the conference.  
**1:16:11-1:16:16:**  And so you know, similar to this question I just made, what are some of the biggest  
**1:16:16-1:16:20:**  challenges that you guys are seeing for farmers to transition?  
**1:16:20-1:16:27:**  Where is there either resistance or struggle to transition towards regenerative agriculture?  
**1:16:27-1:16:35:**  We do still see, even though it changes, that farmers are a bit resistant to new things  
**1:16:35-1:16:37:**  coming into their life.  
**1:16:37-1:16:43:**  Actually, especially when it comes from larger companies because farmers do feel that they  
**1:16:43-1:16:48:**  have been a little bit marginalised over the last years.  
**1:16:48-1:16:51:**  And that is something that is changing and that's why we think also the recognition part  
**1:16:51-1:16:52:**  is so important.  
**1:16:52-1:16:58:**  We realise how big an opportunity it is to actually speak with farmers, be very close  
**1:16:58-1:16:59:**  with farmers.  
**1:16:59-1:17:03:**  Not saying that large companies don't do that and that agronomists don't do that, but to  
**1:17:03-1:17:10:**  really engage with them in the discussion again of how we can make sure to actually  
**1:17:10-1:17:15:**  make their farms and their fields and their practices more sustainable.  
**1:17:15-1:17:16:**  That's very interesting.  
**1:17:16-1:17:20:**  You know, you're making me think about something, a conversation that we had earlier on off  
**1:17:20-1:17:26:**  mic and in the halls and you were talking about the importance of telling a story.  
**1:17:26-1:17:31:**  And you were saying that, Adklim, you're taking on, you're addressing the issue of scaling  
**1:17:31-1:17:34:**  regenerative agriculture also through quite an emotional lens.  
**1:17:34-1:17:40:**  So maybe you could explain to us a bit what that means and why you're doing it like this  
**1:17:40-1:17:44:**  and what it means in practice.  
**1:17:44-1:17:51:**  So what that really means for us is that we're not just a farmer or B2B company, but we also  
**1:17:51-1:17:57:**  work on the consumer or as we heard today citizen side of things.  
**1:17:57-1:18:05:**  By seeing ourselves and our space and our role in the regenerative ecosystem as a larger  
**1:18:05-1:18:10:**  one, meaning we don't just need to take the food corporates and the farmers on board,  
**1:18:10-1:18:15:**  but we also need to take the consumers on board, meaning we actually work, for instance,  
**1:18:15-1:18:20:**  for Instagram, through other campaigns for influencers on educating around what does  
**1:18:20-1:18:23:**  regenerative agriculture actually mean?  
**1:18:23-1:18:26:**  What does agriculture, what does our ecosystem mean?  
**1:18:26-1:18:35:**  How much of an existential and essential foundation of our life it ultimately is.  
**1:18:35-1:18:40:**  So we take that and we really aim to connect that because at the end of the day, we do  
**1:18:40-1:18:47:**  need a consumer pull in order to get a more environmentally friendly, nature friendly,  
**1:18:47-1:18:53:**  climate friendly, however you want to call it, food production and food ecosystem.  
**1:18:53-1:18:59:**  In the current agricultural system or organization, there's often a big divide between the farmer,  
**1:18:59-1:19:05:**  not a divide, but a big distance between the farmer and the consumer.  
**1:19:05-1:19:11:**  Many people, organizations, companies in between and products that can travel extremely far.  
**1:19:11-1:19:16:**  And so I'm curious as to your take on how you're talking about the importance of creating  
**1:19:16-1:19:19:**  more connection there and how does that work in practice?  
**1:19:19-1:19:25:**  What other organizational models are you seeing that could be successful in connecting farmers  
**1:19:25-1:19:29:**  with consumers and that could apply at scale?  
**1:19:29-1:19:34:**  So we work on insetting with large organizations where we take their farmers.  
**1:19:34-1:19:39:**  And that is something that can obviously be very transparently communicated also to customers  
**1:19:39-1:19:41:**  and consumers at the end of the day.  
**1:19:41-1:19:46:**  But also on the offsetting side, we have the opportunity for companies that don't have  
**1:19:46-1:19:52:**  as much control about their supply chains to be working with us offsetting their emissions  
**1:19:52-1:19:56:**  by supporting regenerative agriculture and communicating that through clear brand and  
**1:19:56-1:19:57:**  label claim.  
**1:19:57-1:20:03:**  And we actually very transparently connect that to which farmer is being supported, what  
**1:20:03-1:20:04:**  do they do?  
**1:20:04-1:20:06:**  We show a photo of them.  
**1:20:06-1:20:12:**  And it even means that we even have customers of ours, like B2B customers that go, they  
**1:20:12-1:20:17:**  go to the fields, they make videos with the farmers, they implement it in their communication,  
**1:20:17-1:20:19:**  really connecting and really showing what is actually happening.  
**1:20:19-1:20:26:**  And what's the actual impact of the extra money that the company invests into carbon  
**1:20:26-1:20:28:**  offsets and the ecosystem services.  
**1:20:28-1:20:33:**  But ultimately, of course, also the consumers that buy these products and really bringing  
**1:20:33-1:20:38:**  it closer and showing that, yeah, showing how the food ecosystem works and can change  
**1:20:38-1:20:40:**  and transition in that way.  
**1:20:40-1:20:41:**  That's fascinating.  
**1:20:41-1:20:45:**  One of the big themes that we've been hearing in this conference is about monitoring and  
**1:20:45-1:20:50:**  measuring change and having an outcome based approach to regenerative agriculture.  
**1:20:50-1:20:56:**  And so I was just curious as to, you know, how your company works with that.  
**1:20:56-1:20:58:**  How do you have you developed some kind of a framework?  
**1:20:58-1:21:00:**  Tell us a bit more about that aspect.  
**1:21:00-1:21:05:**  So we have a very science based, science based approach, not going around and soil sampling  
**1:21:05-1:21:12:**  every hectare every year, but looking at what is actually happening and what is proving  
**1:21:12-1:21:16:**  or what is proven that is happening very conservatively.  
**1:21:16-1:21:21:**  We very conservatively look at that in order to potentially improve error margins that  
**1:21:21-1:21:23:**  might be there.  
**1:21:23-1:21:26:**  We calibrate with soil samples and we recognize the importance of them.  
**1:21:26-1:21:35:**  We just don't find them operationally as essential and not where the money should be spent compared  
**1:21:35-1:21:38:**  to the actual transition.  
**1:21:38-1:21:41:**  Based on those models, we very transparently communicate to the farmers of what they can  
**1:21:41-1:21:47:**  expect in terms of carbon sequestration values and do photo documentation as well as satellite  
**1:21:47-1:21:53:**  documentation where we actually know very exactly what is happening, where, on what  
**1:21:53-1:21:56:**  field, at what time.  
**1:21:56-1:21:59:**  And through that, have documented what is actually going on.  
**1:21:59-1:22:01:**  Okay, that's fascinating stuff.  
**1:22:01-1:22:05:**  So maybe to finish off, you could tell us, our listeners, where they can find out more  
**1:22:05-1:22:07:**  about Klim and your work.  
**1:22:07-1:22:14:**  Klim.eco or just shoot us an email, find us on LinkedIn, wherever you may, or on Instagram.  
**1:22:14-1:22:16:**  We have farms and a consumer account.  
**1:22:16-1:22:17:**  Fantastic.  
**1:22:17-1:22:19:**  Felix, thank you so much for taking the time to talk today.  
**1:22:19-1:22:20:**  Thank you.  
**1:22:20-1:22:21:**  Hello, Philipp.  
**1:22:21-1:22:22:**  Very nice to have you here.  
**1:22:22-1:22:25:**  So you're working with Klimat Farmer.  
**1:22:25-1:22:28:**  You're the founder, the co-founder of Klimat Farmers.  
**1:22:28-1:22:32:**  Maybe you can tell us a bit about your work and what Klimat Farmer does to get started  
**1:22:32-1:22:33:**  here.  
**1:22:33-1:22:34:**  Sure.  
**1:22:34-1:22:35:**  Hi, pleasure to be here.  
**1:22:35-1:22:36:**  Very nice.  
**1:22:36-1:22:38:**  Klimat Farmers is essentially there to serve farmers.  
**1:22:38-1:22:43:**  So that means we're helping farmers all over Europe with the transition towards more regenerative  
**1:22:43-1:22:45:**  practices essentially.  
**1:22:45-1:22:51:**  This started with me buying some land and starting a village project in Portugal, which  
**1:22:51-1:22:55:**  caused me to start looking at the land myself, which got me into regenerative agriculture.  
**1:22:55-1:23:00:**  And then I tried to find out why this seems to be such a niche, even though it's a solution  
**1:23:00-1:23:02:**  to so many of our problems.  
**1:23:02-1:23:06:**  And then I had the pleasure of spending almost one year working on regenerative farms with  
**1:23:06-1:23:08:**  regenerative farmers.  
**1:23:08-1:23:10:**  First of all, falling in love with them.  
**1:23:10-1:23:14:**  And second of all, trying to understand what we can do to help them.  
**1:23:14-1:23:16:**  And that's essentially the core starting point for Klimat Farmers.  
**1:23:16-1:23:18:**  Okay, very nice.  
**1:23:18-1:23:20:**  What are your current activities now?  
**1:23:20-1:23:24:**  How do you work with Klimat Farmers at the moment?  
**1:23:24-1:23:29:**  So the essential first part is that we have a community of around 600 farmers in there.  
**1:23:29-1:23:33:**  We organize skill calls between the farmers, so on topics and by experts which the farmers  
**1:23:33-1:23:34:**  can request from us.  
**1:23:34-1:23:38:**  For example, Elaine Ingham, John Kempf, Richard Perkins would be in there.  
**1:23:38-1:23:42:**  We organize the yearly Climate Farming Congress, which is a conference for farmers.  
**1:23:42-1:23:47:**  So we have a majority of farmers being present there, exchanging thoughts with each other.  
**1:23:47-1:23:51:**  And basically everything that we're doing is always driven by feedback that we're getting.  
**1:23:51-1:23:56:**  So one thing that we have been hearing a lot in the last year is that due to the hype around  
**1:23:56-1:24:01:**  regenerative agriculture, there's a lot of new fancy websites coming up with consultants  
**1:24:01-1:24:04:**  which can teach, but they actually don't really know what they're doing.  
**1:24:04-1:24:07:**  And there's a lot of really good consultants, which are very hard to find because they don't  
**1:24:07-1:24:09:**  have fancy websites.  
**1:24:09-1:24:14:**  So what we started building is a farmer-backed consultant database, where we essentially  
**1:24:14-1:24:19:**  have consultants which are verified by farmers from us and recommended to us.  
**1:24:19-1:24:22:**  And then once they have consulted farmers through us again, they get another verification  
**1:24:22-1:24:24:**  because we talked with the farmer afterwards how it was.  
**1:24:24-1:24:29:**  So that we have a better chance at giving farmers the custom-made support that they  
**1:24:29-1:24:34:**  need for transitioning because as we know, it's very context-specific and the general  
**1:24:34-1:24:37:**  principles are nice, but they're not going to help farmers to see how it works in their  
**1:24:37-1:24:38:**  individual context.  
**1:24:38-1:24:39:**  Okay, that's fascinating.  
**1:24:39-1:24:45:**  And I think you've started talking a bit about my, introducing my next question, which is,  
**1:24:45-1:24:50:**  you know, here in the Congress, we've talked a lot about scaling regenerative agriculture.  
**1:24:50-1:24:56:**  And we've heard the opinions of many different players, including companies that are leading  
**1:24:56-1:25:01:**  the industry and corporate players inside the food industry.  
**1:25:01-1:25:07:**  And so I would love to get your take on, you know, what does regenerative agriculture need  
**1:25:07-1:25:08:**  to scale?  
**1:25:08-1:25:11:**  What is the feedback that you're getting from your community of 600 farmers?  
**1:25:11-1:25:17:**  Yeah, I would say the core point is we need to put the sexy back into farming.  
**1:25:17-1:25:21:**  So the core issue that we are seeing and the biggest demographic that we're seeing of farmers  
**1:25:21-1:25:24:**  which are transitioning is age, which is very logical, right?  
**1:25:24-1:25:27:**  Like if you're in your 50s or you're in your 60s and you've been doing something for 30  
**1:25:27-1:25:31:**  years, and then you have to admit that this was wrong and that you need to change your  
**1:25:31-1:25:34:**  practices, you're not going to do this and you're not going to want to do this and you're  
**1:25:34-1:25:38:**  not going to want to hear this or even accept this, which totally makes sense.  
**1:25:38-1:25:41:**  But what is the average age of farmers in the European Union?  
**1:25:41-1:25:42:**  56 years.  
**1:25:42-1:25:45:**  And the reason for that is that it's just not attractive to live on the farm because  
**1:25:45-1:25:49:**  farmers don't get a lot of reward in society and it's just not a profession which people  
**1:25:49-1:25:50:**  want to do.  
**1:25:50-1:25:55:**  So we need to look at how do we make it attractive again for young people to go into farming,  
**1:25:55-1:25:58:**  to take over the farms of their parents, and then we can talk to them and we can show them  
**1:25:58-1:26:00:**  the way towards regenerative agriculture.  
**1:26:00-1:26:03:**  And they will be a lot more open to this and they will be the ones which will be driving  
**1:26:03-1:26:04:**  the change.  
**1:26:04-1:26:06:**  Okay, that's very nice.  
**1:26:06-1:26:11:**  And how do you plan on, how can we make farming more sexy again as you're saying?  
**1:26:11-1:26:14:**  I think there's several parts which are coming into this.  
**1:26:14-1:26:17:**  One is definitely around storytelling and stuff that we're trying to do with farmers  
**1:26:17-1:26:21:**  and with all the social media for example, and it's just giving more recognition to farmers  
**1:26:21-1:26:22:**  again.  
**1:26:22-1:26:26:**  And another part also comes around which is I think very interesting, bringing culture  
**1:26:26-1:26:29:**  back to the countryside because one of the reasons why people also don't want to be in  
**1:26:29-1:26:33:**  farms and why we want to be in cities is because we want culture, we want community, so we  
**1:26:33-1:26:36:**  need to revive those communities and we need to make it attractive again to live on the  
**1:26:36-1:26:37:**  countryside.  
**1:26:37-1:26:40:**  And then of course we also need to make it financially interesting again, right?  
**1:26:40-1:26:45:**  I was speaking here with two farmers which by their parents were told, you should not  
**1:26:45-1:26:49:**  take over the farm because they are already financially with their back against the wall  
**1:26:49-1:26:52:**  and that is just not a bright future to look out for, right?  
**1:26:52-1:26:56:**  So we need to start paying premium and we need to pay especially farmers which have  
**1:26:56-1:26:57:**  positive ecosystem services, right?  
**1:26:57-1:27:01:**  Because that is the issue that we're having right now, that farmers which are farming  
**1:27:01-1:27:05:**  industrial and which are having a negative impact on the planet get the same amount of  
**1:27:05-1:27:08:**  money for their yield than farmers which are farming regeneratively and having so many  
**1:27:08-1:27:13:**  positive benefits ranging from biodiversity over carbon storage to water storage.  
**1:27:13-1:27:17:**  Okay, and I was hearing you speak a lot as well earlier on together in the corridors  
**1:27:17-1:27:25:**  about how transition finance is vital to be able to support the farmers in the regenerative  
**1:27:25-1:27:30:**  transition so that going a bit beyond a freemium to continually farm regeneratively there is  
**1:27:30-1:27:35:**  actually quite a high cost and a high risk around the transition.  
**1:27:35-1:27:39:**  So could you tell us a bit more about that experience that you're having with the farmers,  
**1:27:39-1:27:42:**  feedback you're getting there and solutions that you're excited about?  
**1:27:42-1:27:46:**  Yeah, so I mean one thing that we're definitely seeing there as a good solution is carbon  
**1:27:46-1:27:48:**  plus credits which can cover part of the costs.  
**1:27:48-1:27:51:**  Here it's also I think very important to be realistic.  
**1:27:51-1:27:55:**  I know that there's some ridiculous numbers being thrown around and I know from several  
**1:27:55-1:27:59:**  of our farmers that they have been told some things which are just not unrealistic.  
**1:27:59-1:28:04:**  So we're talking about one to maximum three tons per hectare which is essentially we're  
**1:28:04-1:28:06:**  selling for a premium price of 50 euros per ton.  
**1:28:06-1:28:11:**  So we're talking about something between 50 to 150 euros per hectare per year which is  
**1:28:11-1:28:16:**  a little bit of money but it's not all of the transition cost we're having.  
**1:28:16-1:28:18:**  So this will be part of the solution.  
**1:28:18-1:28:23:**  Another part needs to be coming from society, from governments essentially looking at the  
**1:28:23-1:28:24:**  common agricultural policy.  
**1:28:24-1:28:28:**  Here we're talking about 444 billion euros which are mostly given out based on the size  
**1:28:28-1:28:29:**  of the farm.  
**1:28:29-1:28:33:**  This needs to be given out based on regeneration and based on ecosystem indicators which the  
**1:28:33-1:28:35:**  farmer is increasing.  
**1:28:35-1:28:39:**  And if we have that happening then we will also see a very strong increase in farmers  
**1:28:39-1:28:42:**  really trying to focus on increasing those indicators because they need the subsidies  
**1:28:42-1:28:43:**  to survive.  
**1:28:43-1:28:47:**  To put things in perspective most of the farmers in the European Union are dependent on their  
**1:28:47-1:28:51:**  income of 60 to 80 percent on the European subsidies.  
**1:28:51-1:28:55:**  So this is the very big financial lever that we can be using here.  
**1:28:55-1:28:56:**  That's very interesting.  
**1:28:56-1:29:01:**  And are you starting to work with policy and lobbying and trying to get some change happening  
**1:29:01-1:29:03:**  on the political side?  
**1:29:03-1:29:08:**  Yeah I'm very excited that since half a year we have Mateusz Ciesznoła, my excuses to  
**1:29:08-1:29:13:**  all the Polish listeners for completely messing up his name, but Mateusz is a sixth generation  
**1:29:13-1:29:17:**  Polish farmer that has been transitioning his own farm to us with genetic practices  
**1:29:17-1:29:21:**  and has been doing amazing work in Poland and pushing with genetic agriculture forward.  
**1:29:21-1:29:24:**  And he's right now our policy and advocacy lead which is bringing a lot of the documents  
**1:29:24-1:29:28:**  that we are creating together with our farmers such as the Regenerative Agriculture Manifesto  
**1:29:28-1:29:32:**  that we wrote at the last conference and also the outcome of the next conference that we  
**1:29:32-1:29:36:**  are organizing together with farmers to the Common Agricultural Policy discussion and  
**1:29:36-1:29:37:**  to the European Union discussion.  
**1:29:37-1:29:42:**  We were very happy to have the open ear of Christian Holzleitner, the head of the Sustainability  
**1:29:42-1:29:46:**  Committee who is working together with us in trying to see how we can push regenerative  
**1:29:46-1:29:50:**  agriculture agendas and how we can make this attractive from a farmer's point of view.  
**1:29:50-1:29:51:**  Amazing.  
**1:29:51-1:29:52:**  That's really exciting.  
**1:29:52-1:29:57:**  You have an important role as climate farmers clearly and it's fascinating to see the development  
**1:29:57-1:29:59:**  of climate farmers throughout these years, right?  
**1:29:59-1:30:00:**  How long ago did you start?  
**1:30:00-1:30:05:**  So my journey started essentially in 2018 with an interest in regenerative agriculture.  
**1:30:05-1:30:11:**  Then me and my co-founder Ivo Degen basically decided in June 2019 that this is what we  
**1:30:11-1:30:14:**  want to do with our life or at least with the foreseeable future.  
**1:30:14-1:30:17:**  And then I spent one year researching and speaking with farmers and then we registered  
**1:30:17-1:30:20:**  the company in August 2020.  
**1:30:20-1:30:21:**  Amazing.  
**1:30:21-1:30:23:**  So I've seen you today talk with a lot of the people that are here.  
**1:30:23-1:30:28:**  A lot of them are industry leaders, corporates, etc.  
**1:30:28-1:30:33:**  And so I'd love to know about what do you think is the potential or where do you see  
**1:30:33-1:30:38:**  the role of these companies that are here, for example like Nestle, in the transition  
**1:30:38-1:30:42:**  towards regenerative agriculture and if as climate farmers you are engaging in conversations  
**1:30:42-1:30:47:**  with them and if so, how do you expect to be collaborating with them?  
**1:30:47-1:30:50:**  I mean in the end we're talking about system change here and if we want to do system change  
**1:30:50-1:30:53:**  in agriculture then we need all of the different players to be on the table and we need to  
**1:30:53-1:30:55:**  involve all of them.  
**1:30:55-1:30:59:**  And for me it was a very interesting one because I come from a background of water activism  
**1:30:59-1:31:04:**  in my 20s so I have been actively protesting against Nestle and now I'm speaking with them  
**1:31:04-1:31:09:**  on the table and I have to say I believe them that they're serious about this and I believe  
**1:31:09-1:31:12:**  them that they want to do something and it's a very interesting case there because it comes  
**1:31:12-1:31:13:**  from the top.  
**1:31:13-1:31:19:**  The CEO of Nestle, Mark Schneider, has committed 1.4 billion euros to the regenerative agriculture  
**1:31:19-1:31:20:**  transition.  
**1:31:20-1:31:23:**  So in conversations here today with them we quite literally came to the situation that  
**1:31:23-1:31:28:**  hey I have farmers that want to transition, they need a premium price for this and now  
**1:31:28-1:31:31:**  let's see if they would follow up on the conversation that we had today but the idea was that next  
**1:31:31-1:31:36:**  week they would send me a list of produce which they need for their products from what  
**1:31:36-1:31:40:**  countries and for which they are willing to pay a premium price and for which they're  
**1:31:40-1:31:44:**  paying to guarantee the farmers a premium price if they're turning regeneratively.  
**1:31:44-1:31:48:**  With that I can go back to our farmers and I can say hey if you are transitioning and  
**1:31:48-1:31:53:**  you're growing this crop Nestle will be buying it for 20-30% higher than the market value  
**1:31:53-1:31:56:**  and that is amazing because this is again part of what we need to make the transition  
**1:31:56-1:32:01:**  happen to have farmers being able to get the premium price for a premium product which  
**1:32:01-1:32:04:**  is what we see with a lot of our farmers at the moment which they're not getting.  
**1:32:04-1:32:08:**  They're providing amazing products and they're generating the ecosystem but they're not getting  
**1:32:08-1:32:12:**  paid any cent more than an industrial farmer and that's where the multinational corporations  
**1:32:12-1:32:16:**  like Nestle and Danone and so on need to step in by paying premium prices for regenerative  
**1:32:16-1:32:17:**  produce.  
**1:32:17-1:32:22:**  It's fascinating stuff, it's really exciting and I appreciate your nuanced point of view  
**1:32:22-1:32:26:**  and looking at them as a part of the solution and not trying to Nestle fight against some  
**1:32:26-1:32:30:**  of the things that may have disagreed that they were doing in the past.  
**1:32:30-1:32:33:**  But I'm curious and I'm going to ask this to you because I haven't had the opportunity  
**1:32:33-1:32:38:**  to ask it to other people before but I'm curious if this increase, quite significant increase  
**1:32:38-1:32:43:**  in cost that they're going to incur from regenerative agriculture if they're going to just like  
**1:32:43-1:32:46:**  take that themselves or if they're going to pass that on to consumers at the end.  
**1:32:46-1:32:50:**  Do you have a bit of an idea of some kind of prediction of what's going to happen in  
**1:32:50-1:32:53:**  the future?  
**1:32:53-1:32:56:**  I personally put my money on nutrients.  
**1:32:56-1:33:01:**  I think nutrient density from regenerative produce is a very interesting one and I think  
**1:33:01-1:33:06:**  the direction of what I'm hoping what we can make happen is that we can convince some of  
**1:33:06-1:33:09:**  these bigger players that the transition makes sense and that it will pay off for them in  
**1:33:09-1:33:10:**  the long run.  
**1:33:10-1:33:12:**  So they are investing right now.  
**1:33:12-1:33:14:**  Let it be 1.4 billion.  
**1:33:14-1:33:16:**  Sounds like an insane amount of money for you and for me.  
**1:33:16-1:33:19:**  For them it's like that's okay.  
**1:33:19-1:33:23:**  And with this they can set themselves up as having regenerative supply chains and then  
**1:33:23-1:33:26:**  we will have studies coming back which are running already and we are involved in some  
**1:33:26-1:33:32:**  of them together with the IAT Food on regenerative produce yields which have higher nutrient  
**1:33:32-1:33:34:**  density than conventional organic ones.  
**1:33:34-1:33:38:**  And with that one we can definitely convince consumers again to pay higher prices.  
**1:33:38-1:33:42:**  So I think initially these companies need to pay the transition and I think in the long  
**1:33:42-1:33:47:**  run we will get private consumers to also be willing to pay a premium price because  
**1:33:47-1:33:50:**  if you're not caring for the climate you will definitely be caring for your own health and  
**1:33:50-1:33:51:**  the own health of your children.  
**1:33:51-1:33:56:**  And though you might be very willing to pay a premium for higher nutrient density of food.  
**1:33:56-1:33:57:**  That's very interesting.  
**1:33:57-1:33:58:**  That's fascinating stuff.  
**1:33:58-1:34:02:**  So if you want to find out more about climate farmers where do you suggest they go?  
**1:34:02-1:34:03:**  Where can we find out more about your work?  
**1:34:03-1:34:08:**  That would be either on the website and I'm not on Instagram myself but I'm told we have  
**1:34:08-1:34:12:**  a very amazing Instagram channel so you can definitely find us there as well.  
**1:34:12-1:34:13:**  Fantastic.  
**1:34:13-1:34:14:**  Philippe thank you so much for talking today.  
**1:34:14-1:34:15:**  Cool.  
**1:34:15-1:34:16:**  My pleasure.  
**1:34:16-1:34:18:**  Thank you so much for making it this far.
