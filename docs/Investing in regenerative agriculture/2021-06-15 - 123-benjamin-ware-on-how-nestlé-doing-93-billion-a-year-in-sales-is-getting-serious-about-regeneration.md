### Investing in Regenerative Agriculture and Food  (Tue, 15 Jun 2021 17:00:00)
## 123 Benjamin Ware on how Nestlé, doing 93 billion a year in sales, is getting serious about regeneration  
**[0:00:00-0:00:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:00):**  What is the role of a food company doing 93 billion, yes that's a B, a year in sales in  
**[0:00:06-0:00:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:06):**  the regenerative transition?  
**[0:00:07-0:00:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:07):**  If we like it or not, large food companies, actually large food conglomerates, play a  
**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:12):**  very important role in our current food system.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:14):**  Go to any supermarket and most of it comes from a few brands.  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:18):**  And increasingly they are making claims and are setting goals around regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:00:22-0:00:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:22):**  Do they have a role to play here?  
**[0:00:24-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:24):**  And if yes, what is their role?  
**[0:00:26-0:00:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:26):**  And what are their challenges?  
**[0:00:28-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:28):**  Improving an intransparent, opaque, fundamentally extractive food system towards a regenerative  
**[0:00:33-0:00:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:33):**  one.  
**[0:00:35-0:00:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:35):**  Welcome to a special mini-series where we explore the role of corporates in the regenerative  
**[0:00:39-0:00:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:39):**  transition.  
**[0:00:40-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:40):**  This series is supported by the Earthworm Foundation.

**[0:00:55-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:55):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:00:59):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:01:03-0:01:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:03):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:01:08-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:08):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:14-0:01:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:14):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:17-0:01:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:17):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:20-0:01:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:20):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat.  
**[0:01:23-0:01:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:23):**  And it's time that we, as investors, big and small, and consumers, start paying much  
**[0:01:28-0:01:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:28):**  more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:32-0:01:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:32):**  In March last year, we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:36-0:01:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:36):**  our work.

**[0:01:59-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:01:59):**  Welcome to another episode today with Benjamin Ware, the global head of climate delivery  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:03):**  and sustainable sourcing of one of the biggest food companies in the world, Nestle.  
**[0:02:07-0:02:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:07):**  Welcome Benjamin.  
**[0:02:08-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:08):**  Thank you.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:09):**  And to start with a personal question, what brings you to agriculture and soil, regenerative  
**[0:02:15-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:15):**  agriculture and obviously climate?  
**[0:02:17-0:02:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:17):**  But what was your path towards that?  
**[0:02:18-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:18):**  Well, I mean, overall, of course, Nestle is linked with this because of the DNA of what  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:23):**  we do, which is food, health, nutrition for the world.  
**[0:02:28-0:02:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:28):**  Me, more personally, I'm an agronomist by background and I've grown up in one of these  
**[0:02:34-0:02:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:34):**  countryside in Switzerland and France.  
**[0:02:37-0:02:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:37):**  So it's naturally that I've evolved to these kinds of studies and I reach out to Nestle  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:43):**  as a Swiss citizen to make my career into that.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:48):**  I mean, naturally you say, but it could also be, I mean, I know many people that grew up  
**[0:02:51-0:02:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:51):**  on the countryside and definitely didn't want to work in anything to do with the countryside.  
**[0:02:56-0:03:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:02:56):**  So do you remember if there was a trigger or a moment or something that really made  
**[0:03:01-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:01):**  you study agronomy, which is quite a specific study.  
**[0:03:03-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:03):**  I mean, after that you can do many different things, but you're not going to work in banking  
**[0:03:07-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:07):**  probably.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:08):**  Yeah, no, I would say it's just like nearby my village, there was a potato factory from  
**[0:03:13-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:13):**  a French company that was not Nestle.  
**[0:03:16-0:03:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:16):**  And I was just surrounded by, you know, agri agro food businesses.  
**[0:03:21-0:03:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:21):**  And it was obvious that this was linked with nature.  
**[0:03:24-0:03:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:24):**  I'm very much someone that enjoy nature, sports outdoors, good food and somehow good life  
**[0:03:30-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:30):**  at Nestle.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:32):**  So I haven't really even thought about that.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:35):**  It was a natural pass for me because of the positive vibes I was getting from my surroundings.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:42):**  And within Nestle, did you immediately start, let's say on the sustainable side of things?  
**[0:03:47-0:03:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:47):**  Is it something you grew into?  
**[0:03:49-0:03:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:49):**  What was your career path or your path within such a large company?  
**[0:03:52-0:03:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:52):**  I mean, it's bigger than some countries, so you can do many different things in there,  
**[0:03:56-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:03:56):**  but you ended up definitely on the sustainable side of things and the climate side.  
**[0:04:00-0:04:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:00):**  What was your path there?  
**[0:04:01-0:04:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:01):**  Yeah, so I was actually put in touch with some Nestle individuals while I was working  
**[0:04:07-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:07):**  in the US and immediately when I started at Nestle, they sent me to India, to China to  
**[0:04:13-0:04:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:13):**  be exposed to the sourcing of fresh milk and, you know, the new challenges of the agri and  
**[0:04:20-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:20):**  agro industry over there.  
**[0:04:23-0:04:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:23):**  And for the last 17 years at Nestle, I've been always into sourcing related position,  
**[0:04:29-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:29):**  always linked with farmers, more at the beginning related to really agronomical practices, yield,  
**[0:04:37-0:04:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:37):**  optimization, understanding of, you know, the risk attached to the growing of certain  
**[0:04:43-0:04:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:43):**  crops in certain locations for the given farmers.  
**[0:04:47-0:04:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:47):**  And through this basically risk mitigation approach that I was taking on sourcing, I  
**[0:04:52-0:04:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:52):**  slowly derived on the SESMT agenda.  
**[0:04:56-0:05:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:04:56):**  More on the animal welfare at the beginning, then derived to definitely sustainable sourcing  
**[0:05:02-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:02):**  practices and as a natural evolution to climate afterwards.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:06):**  And do you remember, because I think many food companies have been working on sustainable  
**[0:05:10-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:10):**  sourcing for a long time, but it was never, or at least not that I saw it connected to  
**[0:05:15-0:05:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:15):**  your climate and connected to not even soil in general and the regeneration of soil.  
**[0:05:22-0:05:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:22):**  Is that something that has been growing for a while?  
**[0:05:24-0:05:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:24):**  Honestly, do you remember when that came or became a thing or where we suddenly started  
**[0:05:28-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:28):**  connecting climate and food and ag?  
**[0:05:30-0:05:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:30):**  Not just let's use renewable energy for the factories, let's et cetera, et cetera, but  
**[0:05:34-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:34):**  actually let's change the farming practices and approaches.  
**[0:05:38-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:38):**  Seems to me something relatively new or recent in large food companies.  
**[0:05:43-0:05:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:43):**  Would you say so or what has happened there?  
**[0:05:45-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:45):**  Definitely.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:46):**  It's definitely something new and kind of a great upgrade and shift of how we look at  
**[0:05:50-0:05:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:50):**  sourcing practices.  
**[0:05:52-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:52):**  I think for many decades farming, farmers and practices applied, you know, on land and  
**[0:05:58-0:06:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:05:58):**  territories have been looked at from the practices angle to reach an overall ambition of saying  
**[0:06:06-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:06):**  practices are okay.  
**[0:06:07-0:06:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:07):**  They are in line with ethical standards and expectation.  
**[0:06:12-0:06:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:12):**  Some of them can even reach a certification status and claim a third party, you know,  
**[0:06:18-0:06:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:18):**  organization logo, but it was really looked at from a practices standpoint, less from  
**[0:06:25-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:25):**  an output standpoint, less as you know, how many farmers are benefiting from the practices  
**[0:06:33-0:06:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:33):**  to improve their livelihoods, how many animals are being treated in the right way so that  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:41):**  they better produce or they do X, Y, Z and definitely what's the carbon output of these  
**[0:06:48-0:06:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:48):**  given practices.  
**[0:06:49-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:49):**  So I think this is one of the very positive consequence of the 1.5 degree pledge that  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:06:56):**  we have signed 18 months ago, which has really put a different spin to the sustainable sourcing  
**[0:07:02-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:02):**  practices in basically calling for the measurements of the outputs rather than just the practices.  
**[0:07:11-0:07:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:11):**  And that brings, you know, a challenge because we don't have yet all the methodology to really  
**[0:07:16-0:07:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:16):**  measure adequately the outputs of the given practices that we all like at farm level.  
**[0:07:22-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:22):**  That brings us to a very, very good question.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:24):**  What is for a company your size or any company, let's say a large food company, it doesn't  
**[0:07:29-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:29):**  have to be the behemoth that Nestle is.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:31):**  What's the biggest challenge after you take a pledge like that at 1.5 degrees?  
**[0:07:35-0:07:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:35):**  I will definitely link it below in the show notes.  
**[0:07:38-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:38):**  What's the biggest challenge to then, because that then comes to you to implement it.  
**[0:07:42-0:07:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:42):**  It's all nice and funny when people sign, but then what's the biggest challenge for  
**[0:07:45-0:07:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:45):**  a large company to implement things like that?  
**[0:07:47-0:07:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:47):**  I mean, the biggest challenge is the scope and basically the baseline.  
**[0:07:52-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:52):**  So what is behind these words is the type of raw materials that we are sourcing, the  
**[0:07:57-0:08:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:07:57):**  location where we are sourcing them from, and then the practices in this location.  
**[0:08:03-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:03):**  Because you don't own any farms.  
**[0:08:04-0:08:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:04):**  Like it's not that you are the farmer and you can tomorrow switch a switch if you would  
**[0:08:09-0:08:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:09):**  want to know you are working through a long chain and sometimes a short chain, but yeah,  
**[0:08:13-0:08:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:13):**  it's not your land.  
**[0:08:15-0:08:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:15):**  Yeah.  
**[0:08:16-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:16):**  So let's tackle that as a second step.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:17):**  But I think the first step is definitely really again, the ecosystem, the locations and the  
**[0:08:23-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:23):**  farming model that we are talking about.  
**[0:08:26-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:26):**  And you know, if it would be about just, or I mean just tackling the agricultural practices  
**[0:08:33-0:08:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:33):**  of Nebraska where I did my master's degree, then you know, you work on one country on  
**[0:08:38-0:08:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:38):**  two or three specific crops and the certain climatic and weather conditions, everybody  
**[0:08:44-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:44):**  is more or less trained the same way.  
**[0:08:46-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:46):**  And here we go.  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:48):**  But we basically source 29 million tons of agricultural raw materials per year.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:54):**  How big is it?  
**[0:08:55-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:08:55):**  It's three times the agricultural output of the entire Swiss agriculture.  
**[0:09:01-0:09:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:01):**  And we source these from 86 different countries.  
**[0:09:05-0:09:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:05):**  And of course each of these ton of agricultural raw material is linked with a different crop  
**[0:09:11-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:11):**  and is linked with a pool of different countries and origins.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:15):**  And the farming practices are very different from Peru to Mexico to US to France.  
**[0:09:21-0:09:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:21):**  So where do we start?  
**[0:09:23-0:09:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:23):**  We start, you know, with no really big surprise on the quick wins.  
**[0:09:29-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:29):**  So where we believe we can demonstrate progress and we can practice what we preach with a  
**[0:09:37-0:09:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:37):**  certain supply chain player.  
**[0:09:39-0:09:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:39):**  So how do we do that?  
**[0:09:40-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:40):**  We basically of course trace all our commodities.  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:43):**  We identify the biggest volumes from where are they coming from?  
**[0:09:48-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:48):**  And then basically when we realize that, okay, let's say 20% of our volume of derivatives  
**[0:09:55-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:09:55):**  are coming from three countries, we will embark with the supply chain partners of these three  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:03):**  countries to implement, to understand the practices at farm level and to implement the  
**[0:10:09-0:10:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:09):**  new one that we would love to have being practiced in the years to come.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:14):**  Which now touch what you were talking again, talking about a few minutes ago, which is  
**[0:10:21-0:10:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:21):**  the nature of the supply chain.  
**[0:10:22-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:22):**  As you have said, we basically don't own any of the farms that are supplying this 28, 29  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:29):**  million tons of agricultural raw material to Nestle per year.  
**[0:10:34-0:10:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:34):**  For I would say 10 to 15% of it, we do source directly from farms where of course it's kind  
**[0:10:41-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:41):**  of a very simple and easy situation where it's a Nestle factory sourcing directly fresh  
**[0:10:47-0:10:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:47):**  milk from a cooperative and a group of farmers behind the same for coffee and cocoa.  
**[0:10:53-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:53):**  But for the bulk of this 29 million tons of raw materials, it's through what I call the  
**[0:10:58-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:58):**  trade channels.  
**[0:10:59-0:11:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:10:59):**  So through the procurement channels sourcing from the agricultural commodities of this  
**[0:11:05-0:11:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:05):**  world, the Cargill, the ADM, Louis Dreyfus, Ecom, Volcafe sourcing themselves through  
**[0:11:12-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:12):**  aggregators, mill, elevators, cooperatives, sourcing themselves from farmers.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:19):**  And basically we shouldn't look at that as an issue, but rather as an opportunity for  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:25):**  everybody to basically team up.  
**[0:11:29-0:11:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:29):**  There is no intent at Nestle to source more directly at farmer level.  
**[0:11:33-0:11:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:33):**  Yeah, I was going to ask that.  
**[0:11:35-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:35):**  Do you see that change from like 15 or 20% to 30 or 50?  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:38):**  So you have more control also from a risk perspective or what do you see?  
**[0:11:43-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:43):**  Like is it a natural limit for a company your size to be at the 15, 20%?  
**[0:11:47-0:11:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:47):**  Yeah, I think you're touching the reality check is trying to control 29 million tons  
**[0:11:54-0:12:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:11:54):**  of raw materials from 86 countries by ourselves and sourcing everything from farmers ourselves  
**[0:12:02-0:12:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:02):**  is just unrealistic.  
**[0:12:04-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:04):**  And that's why the agricultural industry is set up like this, to have aggregators, to  
**[0:12:10-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:10):**  have organizations that consolidate these volumes to provide contracts to farmers that  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:16):**  are long term because they are aggregated, consolidated, and sold to the market on an  
**[0:12:22-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:22):**  ongoing basis.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:23):**  So the idea is not really to vertically integrate the supply chain and to own more.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:29):**  The idea and the strategy is definitely yes to stabilize the supply chain.  
**[0:12:34-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:34):**  And when I say stabilize, it doesn't know everybody start to talk about then decommoditize  
**[0:12:41-0:12:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:41):**  the industry.  
**[0:12:42-0:12:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:42):**  That was going to be my next question.  
**[0:12:45-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:45):**  Which is in a way, yes, the right terminology to use in the sense that we are going to move  
**[0:12:51-0:12:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:51):**  away from buying just an asset, which is a ton of raw material to buying an asset together  
**[0:12:59-0:13:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:12:59):**  with soft attributes, which is, you know, for example, a carbon weight or carbon footprint.  
**[0:13:05-0:13:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:05):**  Yeah, because many would say that the anonymization and this ton of grain or this ton of dry milk  
**[0:13:11-0:13:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:11):**  or powder milk, it's all the same.  
**[0:13:14-0:13:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:14):**  Doesn't matter where I get it from, as long as it shows up on my factory door.  
**[0:13:17-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:17):**  That's sort of the extreme example, obviously, but it does lead to a very long distance between  
**[0:13:23-0:13:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:23):**  consumer and farmer or land steward.  
**[0:13:26-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:26):**  And obviously, it leads to a very unhealthy situation for many farmers because they basically  
**[0:13:30-0:13:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:30):**  always sell to the lowest bidder or the other way around.  
**[0:13:33-0:13:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:33):**  So that I think with decommoditization, it's an interesting term.  
**[0:13:36-0:13:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:36):**  It's a bit of a buzzword now.  
**[0:13:37-0:13:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:37):**  But as you're saying, it's without owning the full supply chain, we're already moving  
**[0:13:41-0:13:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:41):**  away from just buying everything on the spot market, or just does not care where it comes  
**[0:13:46-0:13:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:46):**  from and any soft attributes are irrelevant.  
**[0:13:48-0:13:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:48):**  Exactly.  
**[0:13:49-0:13:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:49):**  And actually, it's I mean, what we're passing is the message and the call for action from  
**[0:13:54-0:13:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:54):**  the consumers, the consumers, they don't want this anymore.  
**[0:13:56-0:13:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:56):**  They want to know what is the origins.  
**[0:13:59-0:14:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:13:59):**  How do you see that?  
**[0:14:00-0:14:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:00):**  Do you see that in buying specific brands with a story?  
**[0:14:03-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:03):**  Do you see that as surveys?  
**[0:14:05-0:14:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:05):**  We see that in market share and marketing and sales.  
**[0:14:08-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:08):**  When we run all of this consumer study in, you know, fast moving economies, China, India,  
**[0:14:15-0:14:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:15):**  and also develop markets in sense checking what the consumers expect from the food that  
**[0:14:20-0:14:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:20):**  they buy.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:22):**  And all of them, they expect the food and the ingredients that they are buying to disclose  
**[0:14:27-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:27):**  on back the main origins of the ingredients, and how they've been produced and what are  
**[0:14:33-0:14:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:33):**  the soft attributes behind the food that they eat.  
**[0:14:36-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:36):**  So has that changed?  
**[0:14:38-0:14:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:38):**  It has changed, yes.  
**[0:14:39-0:14:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:39):**  If you've seen that, because you've been doing these studies forever, I think, how has that  
**[0:14:43-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:43):**  changed?  
**[0:14:44-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:44):**  I think, as you have said, these studies have been done since a good 10 years.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:49):**  But in the last two, three years, we've seen really a spike, a true change of answers to  
**[0:14:55-0:15:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:14:55):**  this consumer study, especially in the way consumers talk about their willingness to  
**[0:15:03-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:03):**  reward for food that are able to disclose origins and to disclose practices.  
**[0:15:09-0:15:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:09):**  In the past, they were saying, we are interested and we want, but we are not super ready to  
**[0:15:14-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:14):**  give it a preference in the purchasing act or in premiums kind of thing.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:19):**  So in the last two, three years, definitely there is a big drastic change on that piece  
**[0:15:25-0:15:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:25):**  that maybe comes from the generation, but more, you know, from the broader vibes that  
**[0:15:31-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:31):**  climates, but also governments and regulations are making on the need to preserve our ecosystem  
**[0:15:39-0:15:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:39):**  for the long term and for the new generation to come.  
**[0:15:43-0:15:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:43):**  Super, super interesting.  
**[0:15:44-0:15:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:44):**  I mean, that's what everyone I think is hoping for as soon as the consumer or a good percentage  
**[0:15:48-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:48):**  of the consumer, we don't need everyone.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:50):**  We need enough to a stubborn minority enough to move the sector.  
**[0:15:55-0:15:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:55):**  But it means I'm imagining, I'm assuming that's one of the main reasons, apart from the climate  
**[0:15:59-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:15:59):**  pressure, biodiversity pressure, that you're all part of those discussions, but that the  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:04):**  consumer is moving, which means that if you are able to disclose, if you're able to source  
**[0:16:08-0:16:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:08):**  differently, et cetera, et cetera, you will find a group of people at least willing to  
**[0:16:12-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:12):**  buy and make a different purchasing decision or come back to you or change over another  
**[0:16:16-0:16:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:16):**  brand or change within the brands of Nestle, which makes the case a lot stronger, I think,  
**[0:16:21-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:21):**  throughout the organization.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:23):**  And so the biggest barrier, I mean, it seems to be the size, the quantity you're sourcing  
**[0:16:29-0:16:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:29):**  and then the complexity, because it's not that you're sourcing one ingredient that is  
**[0:16:32-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:32):**  always done everywhere the same.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:34):**  It's sort of counterintuitive to the regenerative movement.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:38):**  So what do you see as the biggest opportunity?  
**[0:16:39-0:16:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:39):**  What do you see as the role of corporates?  
**[0:16:41-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:41):**  What can you, with the size you have and your colleagues that have a similar size, what  
**[0:16:46-0:16:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:46):**  can you do in this regenerative transition?  
**[0:16:48-0:16:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:48):**  At the moment we are now, you've made pledges, you're buying a lot of materials.  
**[0:16:51-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:51):**  A lot of them are not regenerative with regenerative practices yet, but you're doing a lot of work  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:55):**  there.  
**[0:16:56-0:16:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:56):**  What do you see as your role as such a large player in the space?  
**[0:16:59-0:17:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:16:59):**  I mean, we could talk about our role in regards to content and into encouraging the implementation  
**[0:17:07-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:07):**  of the practices or more the operational side.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:10):**  But look, I think what matters for Nestle and company like ours is to send the right  
**[0:17:17-0:17:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:17):**  commercial signals.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:19):**  And that's the way we will basically transform or help to transform the industry.  
**[0:17:25-0:17:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:25):**  And when I say send the right commercial signals, I would divide that into three things.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:32):**  Point one, to send signals that we are not interested that, let's turn that into a positive  
**[0:17:39-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:39):**  angle, that we are interested to buy multi-crop and not anymore single crop.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:45):**  That's a massive one.  
**[0:17:47-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:47):**  And so to give you an example, today we have cocoa buyer.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:51):**  They are in one office, in one desk, and then we have wheat buyer in another office, in  
**[0:17:56-0:17:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:56):**  another desk.  
**[0:17:58-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:58):**  Coconut buyer the same way.  
**[0:17:59-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:17:59):**  We don't basically send signals to the industry that we are interested to buy multiple crops  
**[0:18:06-0:18:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:06):**  together coming from the same land.  
**[0:18:08-0:18:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:08):**  So what is behind and what is in the corridor is we want regenerative agricultural practices  
**[0:18:15-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:15):**  at farm level.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:16):**  But of course, if you ask a farmer to start to crop coconut on top of cocoa trees, he  
**[0:18:23-0:18:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:23):**  will say, I don't have a market for this coconut.  
**[0:18:26-0:18:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:26):**  And I get you that this will capture more carbon and that these two crops will feed  
**[0:18:32-0:18:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:32):**  each other.  
**[0:18:33-0:18:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:33):**  But who is going to buy this coconut?  
**[0:18:35-0:18:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:35):**  So I think a company like Nestle, we basically barely buy any type of raw metals out of the  
**[0:18:42-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:42):**  earth.  
**[0:18:43-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:43):**  So one of the signals is definitely to make a bit of an adaptation of our way of buying.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:50):**  To put those two buyers in the same office at a different desk.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:53):**  Exactly.  
**[0:18:54-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:54):**  To buy crops together so that when a buyer make a request for proposal or request for  
**[0:18:59-0:19:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:18:59):**  information, he basically call for coconut together with cocoa and he negotiate volumes  
**[0:19:06-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:06):**  of both and price of both together so that it basically trigger this commercial pull  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:13):**  for this change and this transformation at farm level.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:16):**  So that's one.  
**[0:19:17-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:17):**  The second one, which is a bit more political, we want farmers to get federated and to unionized  
**[0:19:27-0:19:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:27):**  and to get together.  
**[0:19:29-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:29):**  I still see this as an opportunity for doing things better.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:34):**  There are too many cases where we reach the farm communities and yes, the farmers, they  
**[0:19:41-0:19:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:41):**  know each other, but they don't really work together.  
**[0:19:44-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:44):**  So one of our role is really to engage the farming community in an inclusive manner and  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:52):**  that we try to engage these farmers with the meals that are sourcing from them or the cooperatives  
**[0:19:57-0:20:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:19:57):**  that are sourcing from them so that this community has the opportunity to better know each other  
**[0:20:04-0:20:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:04):**  and then do what?  
**[0:20:06-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:06):**  Do things together in regards to regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:09):**  So again, if you look at what is in the corridor, basically what we would love the farmers to  
**[0:20:13-0:20:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:13):**  do is to upgrade and update the machines that they are using.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:19):**  For example, for reduced tillage, no tillage, but all the farmers will tell you for this  
**[0:20:24-0:20:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:24):**  type of practices, like my coconut and cocoa example, it relates to assets and infrastructures  
**[0:20:32-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:32):**  and very difficult for a single farmer to do that on its own.  
**[0:20:36-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:36):**  So why not to take the opportunity of this boost on regenerative agriculture to try to  
**[0:20:43-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:43):**  put these farming assets into a collective pot and say, okay, now I know my different  
**[0:20:52-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:52):**  farmers, my different neighbors.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:54):**  I know that I'd like to implement this.  
**[0:20:56-0:20:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:56):**  This is what my client wants.  
**[0:20:59-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:20:59):**  I need to buy this type of machines.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:01):**  Let's buy it together as a group of farmers.  
**[0:21:04-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:04):**  And that's where Nestlé will help as well with co-financing.  
**[0:21:07-0:21:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:07):**  So the second thing is where we can help to transform and upgrade the industry is by taking  
**[0:21:14-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:14):**  all our action in a way that it's federating this farming community and it helps all the  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:21):**  farmers to work together in the way they implement.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:25):**  It could be also a risk for you, right?  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:27):**  They could get together and start negotiating much more interesting prices for them.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:32):**  And you as a buyer that have committed to long-term relationships and cannot, I mean,  
**[0:21:35-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:35):**  you are decommodifying your value chain, meaning you're not going to the neighbors or to another  
**[0:21:39-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:39):**  country to buy.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:41):**  Is that something that could backfire as well?  
**[0:21:44-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:44):**  Or because it is such a different approach.  
**[0:21:46-0:21:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:46):**  Like it used to be, we play everybody a bit differently.  
**[0:21:49-0:21:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:49):**  We just keep them anonymized and in the dark.  
**[0:21:52-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:52):**  And this is really a step change away from that.  
**[0:21:55-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:21:55):**  But I'm also imagining that there might be some risks involved from your, as a corporate  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:00):**  perspective, obviously.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:01):**  Yeah, I think it's definitely fair to say.  
**[0:22:04-0:22:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:04):**  I think we need to look, the way to not get too much worried about that is really to look  
**[0:22:11-0:22:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:11):**  at the entire life cycle of this transformative change that needs to happen in regards to the  
**[0:22:16-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:16):**  implementation of regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:22:19-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:19):**  And if you try to not take a full inclusive end-to-end approach of everything that you  
**[0:22:27-0:22:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:27):**  need to do to make the things happen, then you may not federate these farmers.  
**[0:22:32-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:32):**  But then what you have to do is to embark each of them one by one.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:36):**  This will cost a bomb in onboarding farmers one by one and embarking mills one by one.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:43):**  So you need to look, yes, at the entire end-to-end things that you need to do and choose the  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:50):**  best return on investment on having all of this being implemented.  
**[0:22:54-0:23:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:22:54):**  And yes, there are some cons, which can be characterized as cons from a commercial standpoint,  
**[0:23:00-0:23:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:00):**  but really from an end-to-end cost management standpoint, it's much more cost effective  
**[0:23:06-0:23:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:06):**  to help to trigger a feeling of agricultural community, federate all the farmers together,  
**[0:23:15-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:15):**  aggregate the assets at this farming community level, co-finance the asset at this level,  
**[0:23:21-0:23:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:21):**  train everybody at this level.  
**[0:23:23-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:23):**  And it also helps as well in the decommoditation side, because what we need to keep in mind  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:31):**  is it's impossible for a company like us to actually say we are going to source only from  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:36):**  these farmers in the next 20 years to come, because they have implemented this set of  
**[0:23:42-0:23:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:42):**  practices that we want in regards to climate.  
**[0:23:45-0:23:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:45):**  It's unrealistic.  
**[0:23:47-0:23:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:47):**  Because simply of the size of the amount of tons you can buy?  
**[0:23:51-0:23:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:51):**  No, because of things that you cannot control.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:23:54):**  So drought, climatic weather conditions, breakdown, something happened, even the family, personally  
**[0:24:04-0:24:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:04):**  something happened, the political situation, things like this.  
**[0:24:08-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:08):**  So you need to look at the implementation of the regenerative agricultural practices  
**[0:24:12-0:24:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:12):**  at the landscape and community level.  
**[0:24:16-0:24:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:16):**  And basically try to implement and sponsor, co-finance the practices within this pool  
**[0:24:23-0:24:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:23):**  of farms within this state in a given country within this landscape.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:30):**  And at the end, what matters is that you stay in this state, you stay in this landscape.  
**[0:24:36-0:24:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:36):**  And basically, that's the rule of carbon accounting.  
**[0:24:40-0:24:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:40):**  You need to make sure that basically you're connected with this value chain.  
**[0:24:44-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:44):**  It's great that this is linked with these precise farmers.  
**[0:24:48-0:24:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:48):**  But overall, long term, we need the practices to be implemented in this state so that if  
**[0:24:52-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:52):**  we switch from this given farmer to this given other farmer still in the same state, it's  
**[0:24:59-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:24:59):**  still OK from a carbon landscape accounting standpoint.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:05):**  So the third aspect of how we can really help the industry to embrace the challenge is to  
**[0:25:12-0:25:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:12):**  move away from this thinking that everything needs to be one to one.  
**[0:25:19-0:25:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:19):**  It has to be multiple to multiple.  
**[0:25:21-0:25:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:21):**  So multiple buyer, multiple end user like Nestle, Danone, Pepsi, Coca, et cetera, coming  
**[0:25:29-0:25:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:29):**  to one state, producing many different crops from many different farmers and many different  
**[0:25:35-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:35):**  cooperatives and everybody putting a share of an effort into the pool of what we want  
**[0:25:41-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:41):**  in regards to regenerative agriculture so that it benefits everybody.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:46):**  And what do you see as not the role of corporates?  
**[0:25:49-0:25:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:49):**  What is clearly outside?  
**[0:25:50-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:50):**  I mean, there's a lot outside your scope because there's limited things you can do.  
**[0:25:54-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:25:54):**  But what do you see as the role of, let's say, the public or politics or mainly those  
**[0:26:00-0:26:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:00):**  two?  
**[0:26:01-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:01):**  So a bit of a call of action here.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:04):**  I don't see our role is to set the scientific methodology and tools to measure the benefits,  
**[0:26:13-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:13):**  the outputs of the practices that we have to implement.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:18):**  Like the ecosystem services, the outcomes, the water quality, things like that.  
**[0:26:22-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:26:23-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:23):**  So we are basically expecting the academia or the governmental organization to come with  
**[0:26:29-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:29):**  the methodology to measure soil carbon capture, organic matter, soil organic matter, and the  
**[0:26:37-0:26:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:37):**  way to give it a carbon tag.  
**[0:26:40-0:26:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:40):**  So I think our role is really to give technical assistance, dialogue with the farmers, co-finance  
**[0:26:48-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:48):**  rewards for environmental services, really practices-based, and basically make a call  
**[0:26:54-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:26:54):**  for actions to measure the return investment with outputs, with, for example, carbon sequestration  
**[0:27:02-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:02):**  or number of hectares or tons of agricultural metals tagged as regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:09):**  Our role is not to set the methodology to measure soil organic matter or soil coverage  
**[0:27:17-0:27:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:17):**  or the output of these practices.  
**[0:27:21-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:21):**  I guess we could, but the challenge is that if we would do it, then it would be the Nestle  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:27):**  approach.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:28):**  Then we need to make sure that we socialize that with all our peers and competitors.  
**[0:27:33-0:27:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:33):**  We need to come to a common understanding and agreement on how to measure, and it will  
**[0:27:38-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:38):**  take decades.  
**[0:27:39-0:27:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:39):**  We don't have time for this, and that's basically what we kindly ask regulations, governments,  
**[0:27:48-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:48):**  NGOs, and academia to set for us out of all the PhD and the theses that are triggered  
**[0:27:55-0:27:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:55):**  in the world in regards to these topics.  
**[0:27:59-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:27:59):**  There's the food as medicine discussion, and you have a big piece of Nestle that's actually  
**[0:28:03-0:28:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:03):**  health-focused already since years.  
**[0:28:06-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:06):**  What do you see there?  
**[0:28:07-0:28:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:07):**  Because obviously there isn't an issue or a potential challenge with a long value chain  
**[0:28:11-0:28:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:11):**  with a lot of processing around health.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:14):**  Do you see that interest as well in terms of the audience or the potential consumers  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:19):**  as they are looking for, let's say, clearer or more transparent labels?  
**[0:28:23-0:28:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:23):**  Are they also looking for different things from the food, or is that staying the same?  
**[0:28:28-0:28:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:28):**  What are your ideas and thoughts on that whole food as medicine and the quality of the ingredient  
**[0:28:32-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:32):**  piece?  
**[0:28:33-0:28:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:33):**  Definitely, there is a pull for that.  
**[0:28:36-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:36):**  I think basically sustainability in general related to the raw materials or packaging  
**[0:28:41-0:28:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:41):**  is an entire part of the expectation of our consumers in regards to quality.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:49):**  When they talk about, I expect a good quality product, somehow in their mind, and that's  
**[0:28:55-0:29:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:28:55):**  what comes out of the consumer study, they also mean sustainable raw and packaging materials.  
**[0:29:05-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:05):**  Probably one day or another, we'll have a color coding or a grading on pack as we have  
**[0:29:12-0:29:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:12):**  today in regards to the recipe and the health status of the given product that you purchased.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:18):**  It's already there in France, right?  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:20):**  In Europe, and I know it's in the Netherlands, it's coming in the color code that the traffic  
**[0:29:23-0:29:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:23):**  light system is starting to, and in Australia as well.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:27):**  Exactly, A, B, C, D. I think one day or another, the sensitivity angle will be embedded in  
**[0:29:34-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:34):**  either into that or with its own dedicated visuals.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:40):**  As an example, in Europe, you have this already color coding that exists and it takes into  
**[0:29:45-0:29:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:45):**  consideration if the raw materials has an organic certification.  
**[0:29:50-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:50):**  I think you get some points if it's there.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:52):**  I think the door is already half open and basically sustainability will get embedded  
**[0:29:57-0:29:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:57):**  into that.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:29:58):**  I think this will also pull for simplification of the value chain in general and probably  
**[0:30:04-0:30:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:04):**  pull for simplification as well of the recipe, of the number of the ingredients that are  
**[0:30:09-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:09):**  being used and the kind of industrial transformation which is applied to get the food that we get  
**[0:30:16-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:16):**  as packaged food.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:17):**  I'm far from being an expert from this, but to your question, yes, I think it's going  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:20):**  to pull for this.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:22):**  I think there's an interesting challenge there from uniformity as well.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:26):**  We expect packaged food to potentially always taste the same except when we buy wine, etc.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:33):**  Then we know, okay, different years are different things.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:35):**  But then if we go into the chocolates and go to the coffees, we as consumers, I'm saying,  
**[0:30:42-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:42):**  have to go through a transformation as well.  
**[0:30:44-0:30:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:44):**  Things taste different in different years and things taste different in different seasons.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:48):**  Butter is not always the same and milk is not always the same.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:50):**  We sort of know that, but as we are in the supermarket choosing certain things, we sort  
**[0:30:54-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:54):**  of expect the flavor to be constant.  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:30:56):**  As you are probably embarking on a journey to make the ingredients simpler and more flavor  
**[0:31:02-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:02):**  will come through, more different flavors will come through.  
**[0:31:04-0:31:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:04):**  That would be interesting to see how consumers say a lot of things, but if we at the end  
**[0:31:09-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:09):**  we want it always to taste the same or similar, then it could be a challenge for these ingredients  
**[0:31:13-0:31:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:13):**  to shine basically.  
**[0:31:16-0:31:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:16):**  To ask a few questions I always like to ask and I'm very curious about your view on them.  
**[0:31:21-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:21):**  What do you believe to be true about regenerative agriculture that others don't?  
**[0:31:25-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:25):**  This is definitely inspired by John Kempf who always asks in his podcast on agriculture  
**[0:31:29-0:31:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:29):**  in general, but where are you contrarian in this regenerative movement?  
**[0:31:33-0:31:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:33):**  What do you believe to be true that others don't?  
**[0:31:35-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:35):**  Yeah, that's a tough question.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:37):**  I think everybody has the tendency to argue and I started our monologue, our dialogue  
**[0:31:44-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:44):**  on this to say that regenerative agriculture differs from one crop to another, from one  
**[0:31:50-0:31:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:50):**  location to another, and there is almost no common foundation about regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:57):**  I slightly disagree with this.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:31:59):**  I think regenerative agriculture has two main foundations.  
**[0:32:03-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:03):**  The first one is the main concept of not harming nature by using things that are not supposed  
**[0:32:12-0:32:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:12):**  to be used over nature.  
**[0:32:16-0:32:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:16):**  That's the fundamental principle of regenerative agriculture that you're here basically to  
**[0:32:21-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:21):**  have a positive impact and of course not to harm.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:27):**  I think this is a common foundation of regenerative agriculture regardless of the crop, regardless  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:32):**  of the location, regardless of the farming production methods and way of doing things  
**[0:32:37-0:32:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:37):**  that apply to everybody.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:39):**  What do you do with criticism then of people pointing out or saying big food companies,  
**[0:32:44-0:32:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:44):**  everything is evil.  
**[0:32:45-0:32:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:45):**  They just, I wouldn't say greenwash, I mean there was a word we used before, sustainable  
**[0:32:49-0:32:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:49):**  wash or now for sure we're going to call it regenerative washing.  
**[0:32:52-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:52):**  They come out with big claims and at the end of the day, of course, you're going to find  
**[0:32:57-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:32:57):**  something in the value chain that doesn't work and there will be articles also about  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:00):**  Nestle but all the others with big claims.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:03):**  What do you say to that criticism?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:04):**  Not harming nature, yeah, but you're actually doing X, Y, Z in this and this field.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:09):**  What is your response to that at a birthday party when somebody brings up an article or  
**[0:33:14-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:14):**  brings up something that they read somewhere?  
**[0:33:16-0:33:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:16):**  Yeah, so I would say, I mean, first of all, fair, there is no perfection anywhere and  
**[0:33:24-0:33:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:24):**  we are not claiming that everything will be perfect on every places where we are sourcing  
**[0:33:29-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:29):**  these raw metals and there will be always pockets of improvements needed.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:34):**  I would say we really try our best to be as transparent and as granular as possible in  
**[0:33:41-0:33:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:41):**  regards to this topic.  
**[0:33:42-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:42):**  So I think we are really one of the few companies that already today disclose on Nestle website  
**[0:33:50-0:33:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:50):**  all the origins, all the locations for all our ingredients.  
**[0:33:55-0:33:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:55):**  And when I say that, it's not only the tier one suppliers from whom we have the commercial  
**[0:33:59-0:34:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:33:59):**  contract, but it's also the upstream supply chain partners with the volumes and the status  
**[0:34:06-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:06):**  of practices.  
**[0:34:07-0:34:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:07):**  So I think the best way to have this discussion in a birthday party is to say fact-based and  
**[0:34:14-0:34:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:14):**  also to be a bit humble and to say there is no way you can reach perfection on a topic  
**[0:34:19-0:34:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:19):**  like this, embarking into a transformative journey.  
**[0:34:24-0:34:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:24):**  Whereas I was taught when I was in school that chemists and chemicals is the feed for  
**[0:34:31-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:31):**  agriculture.  
**[0:34:32-0:34:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:32):**  This is what I was taught 20 years ago.  
**[0:34:36-0:34:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:36):**  I was taught to run agriculture by basically using synthetic inputs.  
**[0:34:42-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:42):**  And I think we cannot expect the world to change this in just one decade.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:48):**  So to your question on that, I think it's about us making sign of being humble and being  
**[0:34:55-0:34:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:55):**  as transparent as we can in regards to facts and figures.  
**[0:34:59-0:35:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:34:59):**  And come and help.  
**[0:35:00-0:35:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:00):**  I mean, if you have, there's a lot of work to be done in order value change and it's  
**[0:35:04-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:04):**  easy, not easy, but it's sort of easy to point it out, but it's definitely not easy to change.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:10):**  Yeah.  
**[0:35:11-0:35:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:11):**  So the second point in regards to what people don't believe is true.  
**[0:35:16-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:16):**  And I believe is true and it's really controversial is somehow regenerative agriculture doesn't  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:24):**  mean that you phase out entirely the use of synthetic fertilizer.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:31):**  And a lot of the community believes that basically if you cruise for regenerative agriculture,  
**[0:35:37-0:35:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:37):**  you are basically cruising for organic agriculture.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:41):**  And one day or another, the farmers will just switch to organic to achieve the additional  
**[0:35:48-0:35:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:48):**  premiums and to gain even more return on what they have done.  
**[0:35:53-0:35:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:53):**  I don't believe this is true.  
**[0:35:54-0:36:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:35:54):**  I believe that to be really regenerative, there will be from time to time a little need  
**[0:36:02-0:36:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:02):**  of a boost just in a sporadic manner.  
**[0:36:05-0:36:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:05):**  And this boost will still come from the chemical industry and the agrochemical industry.  
**[0:36:12-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:12):**  I've been visiting a lot of different farmers showing me the structure of the soil and a  
**[0:36:19-0:36:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:19):**  few of them were saying, if I really, and I'm going to touch a very touchy point and  
**[0:36:25-0:36:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:25):**  name if I really phase out glyphosate really entirely, I have a big problem and I cannot  
**[0:36:32-0:36:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:32):**  control this problem with natural solution.  
**[0:36:36-0:36:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:36):**  If I do so, then I truly have a yield issue and then business wise, it doesn't make any  
**[0:36:44-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:44):**  sense.  
**[0:36:45-0:36:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:45):**  So what crops are we talking about?  
**[0:36:47-0:36:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:47):**  What kind of farmers?  
**[0:36:48-0:36:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:48):**  We're not talking about the cocoa.  
**[0:36:49-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:49):**  Perennials, so annual crops.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:50):**  Wheat, et cetera.  
**[0:36:51-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:51):**  Exactly.  
**[0:36:52-0:36:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:52):**  So they were saying, you know, in the past I was using probably glyphosate twice a year.  
**[0:36:59-0:37:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:36:59):**  Now I have switched to these practices and I'm using glyphosate sporadically every three  
**[0:37:04-0:37:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:04):**  years, but I have to.  
**[0:37:07-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:07):**  Which is a 6X drop.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:08):**  Yeah.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:09):**  And it's very controversial because again, there is this movement of saying regenerative  
**[0:37:13-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:13):**  agriculture means that again, you replace every single things by practices or by natural  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:22):**  solution, which I think is right in 95% of the case, but I don't believe we'd be able  
**[0:37:29-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:29):**  at least 2020 to 2030 to achieve such status.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:34):**  And it basically, you know, open a debate for hours, but I think that's a second thing.  
**[0:37:38-0:37:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:38):**  No, I think it's interesting.  
**[0:37:40-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:40):**  I think it's the context that is always very specific.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:42):**  I mean, we had Zach Bush on the podcast about Roundup and glyphosate and glyphosate, I always  
**[0:37:47-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:47):**  mess up the name.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:49):**  And yeah, it's interesting the argument on if you have a very healthy soil, you don't  
**[0:37:54-0:37:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:54):**  need these chemical inputs, but if you are on a journey to the healthy soil and you don't  
**[0:37:57-0:38:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:37:57):**  have the space to replace it with organic inputs or not, or your soils are not ready  
**[0:38:02-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:02):**  or your context doesn't make sense, you cannot have the yield drop, et cetera, et cetera,  
**[0:38:06-0:38:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:06):**  et cetera.  
**[0:38:07-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:07):**  Is there a place for, and I think that makes the movement interesting that it's not binary.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:12):**  It's not you are or you are not regenerative like organic everywhere is because it is a  
**[0:38:16-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:16):**  certification and it is a standard.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:18):**  And in many cases it's not regenerative.  
**[0:38:20-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:20):**  Like it definitely was in the beginning when it was about chemical inputs and not necessarily  
**[0:38:25-0:38:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:25):**  about soil, but we've, I think all visited organic farms that are far from building soil  
**[0:38:30-0:38:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:30):**  and many that are, I mean, just to give credit to our credit is due, but I think the direction  
**[0:38:34-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:34):**  of how do you build soil to a moment where you maybe need it once every 10 year or never  
**[0:38:38-0:38:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:38):**  need it depending on where you are, what rotations you're doing, but it doesn't mean that in  
**[0:38:42-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:42):**  year six, potentially you cannot use it, lose everything just because you want to stay within  
**[0:38:48-0:38:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:48):**  a system or stay within the boundary.  
**[0:38:50-0:38:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:50):**  So I think it's a very challenging concept for many.  
**[0:38:52-0:38:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:52):**  I'm happy you bring it up and we can probably spend another few hours.  
**[0:38:55-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:55):**  We'll for sure get reactions on it, which is great, but it's the direction I think that  
**[0:38:59-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:38:59):**  counts and it's a continuum.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:01):**  You're somewhere on the journey.  
**[0:39:02-0:39:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:02):**  Every farmer, every land steward, every land owner is on a journey either down to extract  
**[0:39:07-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:07):**  more from their soils or either to rebuild them and we have to help them.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:12):**  We have to meet them wherever they are.  
**[0:39:14-0:39:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:14):**  You cannot expect people to change overnight, buy all new machines, have a yield drop of  
**[0:39:19-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:19):**  20, 30, 40% in five years.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:21):**  And then yeah, then after that you will, you will recover.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:24):**  But yeah, that's not fair for us to ask from anybody.  
**[0:39:27-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:27):**  And I think what is important in what you've just summarized is the transition phase.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:33):**  I think we need to keep that in mind.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:35):**  We are in a transition.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:37):**  Things will be different in the future once this transition is implemented, but we need  
**[0:39:42-0:39:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:42):**  to find and to choose the right solutions to make the best chance that this transition  
**[0:39:49-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:49):**  succeed.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:50):**  And as you have said, maybe it's about, you know, using still few practices to help the  
**[0:39:55-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:39:55):**  new one to get implemented and once the new one are really paying off and are scaled up  
**[0:40:01-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:01):**  at the land level, then you can stop and decrease and phase out completely.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:40:07-0:40:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:07):**  And I want to ask two final questions before we have to sign off.  
**[0:40:11-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:11):**  I want to be conscious of your time.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:13):**  If there's one thing you could change overnight, so you have a magic wand, you have magic power  
**[0:40:16-0:40:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:16):**  to change one thing in the food and agriculture sector or in general, what would that be?  
**[0:40:21-0:40:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:21):**  What would be your one wish?  
**[0:40:23-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:23):**  To have all of the farmers virtually connected to us.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:28):**  So having a, you know, a single identifier for all farmers and having all farmers having  
**[0:40:34-0:40:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:34):**  an app where they make themselves connected to a cloud and then everybody's see and is  
**[0:40:41-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:41):**  connected to each other.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:42):**  So I think the really big foundation of everything that we do, let's spell it like this, it's  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:47):**  the identity preservation, which will resonate with a lot of agri colleagues.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:52):**  It's traceability is knowing who is there.  
**[0:40:56-0:41:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:40:56):**  So it is this wish today, this industry because of us, you know, because of everybody in the  
**[0:41:02-0:41:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:02):**  value chain.  
**[0:41:03-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:03):**  It's a very opaque one.  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:05):**  It's very cumbersome, extremely difficult for the farmers to know who are their clients  
**[0:41:10-0:41:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:10):**  and for the clients to know who are their farmers.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:14):**  So if I could have a, one of these magic thing that suddenly gives a single identifier to  
**[0:41:20-0:41:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:20):**  everybody and connect everybody in a cloud and then traceability is not anymore a challenge  
**[0:41:25-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:25):**  that will help.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:26):**  I think it's a very good answer.  
**[0:41:28-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:28):**  We never had that like that.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:29):**  And to end, this could be another rabbit hole where we can keep it for another discussion  
**[0:41:33-0:41:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:33):**  as well, but we took your magic wand away.  
**[0:41:35-0:41:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:35):**  So you no longer have that power, but you do have, and in this case maybe you do actually,  
**[0:41:39-0:41:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:39):**  but a billion dollar investment fund.  
**[0:41:41-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:41):**  So you are putting your investment hat on.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:44):**  This is a podcast about investing in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:41:47-0:41:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:47):**  What would you focus on with that fund?  
**[0:41:51-0:41:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:51):**  So you have a long, you could have a long-term view, very short.  
**[0:41:53-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:53):**  You can choose whatever you want, but it is an investment fund.  
**[0:41:56-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:56):**  So it cannot do grants.  
**[0:41:57-0:41:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:57):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:41:59-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:41:59):**  Is it technology?  
**[0:42:00-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:00):**  Is it food companies?  
**[0:42:01-0:42:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:01):**  Is it transition finance?  
**[0:42:03-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:03):**  What would be your, your focus as a fund manager from tomorrow?  
**[0:42:06-0:42:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:06):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:07-0:42:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:07):**  So I would say one thing which is for sure is that climate change is going to impact  
**[0:42:13-0:42:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:13):**  everybody or industries together.  
**[0:42:16-0:42:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:16):**  And that's a big threat and opportunity at the same time for our economy.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:21):**  So point one, if I would have a billion funds to invest, we look at investing that to something  
**[0:42:28-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:28):**  connected to climate, because that's the way to help the earth.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:33):**  And that's the way to basically probably definitely make money and help the way to forward.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:40):**  And when you say connected to climate, is that solar panels, electric cars?  
**[0:42:43-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:43):**  Yeah.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:44):**  Let me go to that.  
**[0:42:45-0:42:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:45):**  So then when you think about climate, there is one thing that I would do as well is to  
**[0:42:50-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:42:50):**  make sure that I invest into organization companies, technologies that generate carbon  
**[0:43:00-0:43:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:00):**  reductions and removals.  
**[0:43:02-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:02):**  So what I think is very dangerous today is the race for sponsoring and financing the  
**[0:43:10-0:43:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:10):**  decarbonization not linked with the value chain of the industries.  
**[0:43:16-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:16):**  And what I see coming is basically a competition between carbon reductions and removals of  
**[0:43:22-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:22):**  organization and then the offsetting market.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:26):**  So I would try to give a boost to technologies and organization that create solutions to  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:33):**  decarbonize the company within the value chain of the different industry.  
**[0:43:38-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:38):**  And I would make sure that the money is not used to basically boost the carbon credit.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:44):**  And it's not that I'm trying to pull that on the side of Nestle, but if I would invest  
**[0:43:48-0:43:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:48):**  this money, I will think like, OK, I would invest into a company that create a new type  
**[0:43:53-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:53):**  of fuel for the airlines or a new type of engine or a new type of infrastructure instead  
**[0:43:59-0:44:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:43:59):**  of boosting things that create carbon credits for the airline companies then to come and  
**[0:44:04-0:44:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:04):**  compensate.  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:06):**  So I think we need to be extra careful in this race for carbon that we invest our time,  
**[0:44:12-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:12):**  energy and money into an in-setting decarbonization and that we make really extra care that we  
**[0:44:21-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:21):**  don't boost things that will boost the compensation market.  
**[0:44:26-0:44:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:26):**  And definitely today, governments and regulation, they are trying to do the same because they  
**[0:44:31-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:31):**  have identified that if we do things the wrong way, we are going to end up into a competition.  
**[0:44:39-0:44:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:39):**  It's going to basically trigger business as usual.  
**[0:44:41-0:44:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:41):**  It's going to trigger and boost the compensation market and not really make the proper upgrade.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:47):**  So that would be the extra care that I would make.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:50):**  Thank you so much, Benjamin, for your time, for your openness.  
**[0:44:54-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:54):**  And I'm very excited to follow this.  
**[0:44:57-0:45:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:44:57):**  I mean, there's an enormous role for companies like Nestle and I'm happy you're taking the  
**[0:45:01-0:45:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:45:01):**  challenge being humble.  
**[0:45:02-0:45:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:45:02):**  There are going to be barriers and roadblocks and it's a rocky ride, but for everyone.  
**[0:45:07-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:45:07):**  So I'm happy to have you here.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:45:09):**  So let's take an appointment and meet again in one year.  
**[0:45:12-0:45:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benjamin-ware#t=0:45:12):**  And I tell you where we are in our journey and our KPIs and performance on carbon and
