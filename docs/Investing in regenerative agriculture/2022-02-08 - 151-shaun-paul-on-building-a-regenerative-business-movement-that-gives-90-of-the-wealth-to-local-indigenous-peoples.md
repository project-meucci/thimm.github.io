**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:14):**  What does pine resin has to do with regeneration and how do you build true wealth for indigenous  
**[0:00:18-0:00:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:18):**  peoples through building assets you actually don't own?  
**[0:00:22-0:00:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:22):**  The first 10 minutes you hear a bit of background noise of the tree nursery where this conversation  
**[0:00:26-0:00:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:26):**  was recorded.  
**[0:00:29-0:00:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:29):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:34-0:00:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:34):**  Planet Mattered, a podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and  
**[0:00:38-0:00:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:38):**  agriculture space to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil,  
**[0:00:43-0:00:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:43):**  people, local communities and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:00:49-0:00:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:49):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:00:52-0:00:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:52):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:00:55-0:01:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:00:55):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small,  
**[0:01:01-0:01:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:01):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:07-0:01:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:07):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:11-0:01:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:11):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.

**[0:01:34-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:34):**  Welcome to another episode.  
**[0:01:35-0:01:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:35):**  Today with Sean Paul, the CEO of Egido Verde, a sustainable pine raisin company positioned  
**[0:01:39-0:01:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:39):**  to become a lead supplier of the 10 billion US dollar global pine chemical industry.  
**[0:01:44-0:01:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:44):**  They increased the constrained Mexican pine resin supply with an adaptive reforestation  
**[0:01:50-0:01:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:50):**  model to restore degraded lands and with strategically guaranteed buyers.  
**[0:01:54-0:01:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:54):**  Welcome Sean Paul.  
**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:55):**  Greetings.  
**[0:01:56-0:01:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:56):**  I always like to start with a personal question.  
**[0:01:58-0:02:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:01:58):**  How did you end up disrupting or working in the disruption, let's say of the pine resin  
**[0:02:04-0:02:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:04):**  supply industry?  
**[0:02:05-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:05):**  Because it's quite a specific niche of the niche and I'm very interested how did you  
**[0:02:09-0:02:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:09):**  end up reforestation, et cetera?  
**[0:02:12-0:02:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:12):**  What was the road that led you to become part of this organization?  
**[0:02:16-0:02:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:16):**  Wonderful question.  
**[0:02:17-0:02:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:17):**  I pursued a career from my beginning of my 20s in international development and finance.  
**[0:02:24-0:02:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:24):**  I started my first company in 1992 Ecologic Development Fund where really it's been my  
**[0:02:30-0:02:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:30):**  life trajectory of how do we move money to grow sustainable livelihoods of people in  
**[0:02:38-0:02:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:38):**  places important for their biodiversity.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:42):**  That can look like, what does it look like to support communities in a protected area  
**[0:02:47-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:47):**  in the tropics to build ways to earn a living that reinforce the conservation of nature  
**[0:02:53-0:02:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:53):**  in their protected area.  
**[0:02:55-0:02:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:55):**  I've done this I think in my career, I think you may know and if we look at the planet,  
**[0:02:59-0:03:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:02:59):**  80% of the world's biodiversity is on lands used and occupied by indigenous peoples.  
**[0:03:07-0:03:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:07):**  Over my career, I guess approaching 30 years, it's been where I've been working in a number  
**[0:03:11-0:03:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:11):**  of ways of how we deploy money, grants, loans, equity with indigenous communities in a way  
**[0:03:18-0:03:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:18):**  that improve nature.  
**[0:03:19-0:03:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:19):**  That's set done a number of companies and one of them, I formed the Impact Venture Fund  
**[0:03:26-0:03:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:26):**  a few years back and it was with that fund that I was approached by a Mexican family  
**[0:03:31-0:03:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:31):**  for three generations.  
**[0:03:32-0:03:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:32):**  They have been buying pine resin in Michoacán, Mexico from forest communities and they turn  
**[0:03:38-0:03:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:38):**  that pine resin into ingredients that they sell to the world into diverse industries.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:46):**  The group, the Pinoza group, this family business was challenged with how to increase and assure  
**[0:03:54-0:04:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:03:54):**  reliable supply of pine resin in the context that where this resin comes from in the natural  
**[0:04:00-0:04:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:00):**  forest, the forest is being lost to deforestation and land use change.  
**[0:04:06-0:04:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:06):**  But they really, I ultimately accepted and my friendly advice to them as a prospective  
**[0:04:13-0:04:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:13):**  investor turned into based in Boston, I've been living in Boston for 25 years and they  
**[0:04:18-0:04:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:18):**  just made an irresistible offer for me to join them in building Ajiro Verde to realize  
**[0:04:25-0:04:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:25):**  its goals, tapping on my expertise that they didn't have, how do you mobilize impact investment,  
**[0:04:31-0:04:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:31):**  do it in a way that's appropriate and sensitive to the unique customs of indigenous peoples  
**[0:04:37-0:04:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:37):**  and how do we do that in a way that gets them the pine resin supply they want, improve the  
**[0:04:41-0:04:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:41):**  environment, improve social conditions and create an offering to the right investors  
**[0:04:48-0:04:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:48):**  that allow us to realize our goals as a company Ajiro Verde.  
**[0:04:53-0:04:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:53):**  So I joined the company about five years ago and assuming the role of CEO.  
**[0:04:58-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:58):**  And moved to Mexico.  
**[0:04:59-0:05:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:04:59):**  And moved to Mexico where you're reaching me in this call today from Morelia, Michoacán,  
**[0:05:05-0:05:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:05):**  Mexico.  
**[0:05:06-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:06):**  And just for people to understand what is pine resin?  
**[0:05:10-0:05:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:10):**  Just do a very dummy talk.  
**[0:05:12-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:12):**  What should we imagine?  
**[0:05:13-0:05:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:13):**  What is it used for?  
**[0:05:14-0:05:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:14):**  How does it come out of a tree?  
**[0:05:15-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:15):**  How do you even harvest that?  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:18):**  And what does it look like?  
**[0:05:20-0:05:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:20):**  Okay.  
**[0:05:21-0:05:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:21):**  So I'm sure, you know, we've, our listeners have at some point been in a forest with pine  
**[0:05:27-0:05:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:27):**  trees and there's sap sometimes on the bark.  
**[0:05:30-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:30):**  It's sticky.  
**[0:05:31-0:05:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:31):**  And the way the pine resin is extracted, it's many ways, but the primary way in Mexico and  
**[0:05:38-0:05:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:38):**  many parts of the world is that a cut is made in the bark and it goes slightly into the  
**[0:05:44-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:44):**  body of the tree.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:46):**  And there are in effect, there are veins running through pine trees where it's part of the  
**[0:05:51-0:05:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:51):**  circulatory system of the tree is the pine resin.  
**[0:05:54-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:54):**  It's part of its defense.  
**[0:05:55-0:06:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:05:55):**  It's part of how trees don't die or live, you know, trees we plant will live for 80  
**[0:06:01-0:06:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:01):**  to 100 years.  
**[0:06:03-0:06:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:03):**  So the tapper, you have these tools and you cut open the bark and then the sap begins  
**[0:06:07-0:06:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:07):**  to drip, right?  
**[0:06:08-0:06:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:08):**  Because you're opening a vein and in effect it starts to drip.  
**[0:06:11-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:11):**  And they put a cup there so that the drippings fall into the cup.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:15):**  It's very slow.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:17):**  So it's kind of like the tapper might make that scrape and then they'll come back to  
**[0:06:22-0:06:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:22):**  that tree in eight days and the cup, which might be 16 ounces, would fill up and they  
**[0:06:27-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:27):**  empty that cup.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:28):**  And because we're in a temperate climate, that cut, when they make the cut, it crystallizes.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:33):**  And so that means the resin stops dripping and it crystallizes.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:38):**  And to keep it from dripping, they got to every eight days scrape the cut to fill up  
**[0:06:42-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:42):**  another cup.  
**[0:06:44-0:06:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:44):**  So that gives a little sense of where the resin comes from.  
**[0:06:47-0:06:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:47):**  It's similar, you can think about maple syrup and how it's extracted from trees or rubber,  
**[0:06:54-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:54):**  you know, is tapped also from trees.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:06:56):**  And they're all similar in that we're scraping the bark to get into the wood and in that  
**[0:07:02-0:07:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:02):**  wood you collect these resins.  
**[0:07:04-0:07:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:04):**  In terms of your question of how pine resin is used, one of the first documented uses  
**[0:07:11-0:07:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:11):**  of pine resin is in the Bible.  
**[0:07:14-0:07:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:14):**  And in Genesis, it actually, I mean, there was one line where, you know, when Noah was  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:19):**  told by God to build the ark, he was told to build it with pine resin.  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:25):**  So pine resin is also known as pitch and it's been used as a sealant for wood boats for  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:31):**  millennia, including, you know, according to the Bible, right, they were using pitch  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:34):**  for sealant on wood boats, you know, five, six thousand years ago.  
**[0:07:39-0:07:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:39):**  In my region where my adopted home of Mishwakan, the local cult peoples of the Porepecha, an  
**[0:07:48-0:07:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:48):**  indigenous cultural group, they've been using pine resin for also for millennia for sealant  
**[0:07:54-0:07:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:54):**  on wood boats and for medicinal purposes.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:07:57):**  However, if we fast forward to contemporary times and how is pine resin used today commercially,  
**[0:08:04-0:08:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:04):**  the volume of pine resin traded today in the world is equivalent to the volume of cacao  
**[0:08:10-0:08:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:10):**  traded in the world.  
**[0:08:11-0:08:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:11):**  Wow.  
**[0:08:12-0:08:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:12):**  Pretty significant volume and yet most of us had no idea.  
**[0:08:17-0:08:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:17):**  And I would also say that most of us had no idea that everybody, everywhere, every day  
**[0:08:24-0:08:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:24):**  uses products made with pine resin.  
**[0:08:27-0:08:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:27):**  To give an example, it's used for adhesives, sticky, a tactifier, and some of those adhesives  
**[0:08:33-0:08:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:33):**  are shoe glue.  
**[0:08:35-0:08:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:35):**  So I always ask people, your shoe glue, was it made with the green chemistry, climate  
**[0:08:40-0:08:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:40):**  solving pine chemicals, or was it made with hydrocarbon sourced from petroleum?  
**[0:08:46-0:08:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:46):**  And most glue today is sourced from petroleum, yet we, the pine chemical industry, offer  
**[0:08:51-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:51):**  substitutes for adhesives to petroleum.  
**[0:08:54-0:08:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:54):**  So that would be one of the other uses.  
**[0:08:57-0:09:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:08:57):**  We're in food products, carbonated beverages, chewing gum.  
**[0:09:00-0:09:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:00):**  We have organic pine resin, uses preservative, organic, we have kosher ingredients, kosher  
**[0:09:08-0:09:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:08):**  grade inks, adhesives, pharmaceuticals, electronics are all different industries with applications  
**[0:09:14-0:09:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:14):**  using pine resin.  
**[0:09:15-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:15):**  And where does the, like where traditionally or what's the, on this massive market, I mean,  
**[0:09:22-0:09:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:22):**  cacao comes from a few specific places.  
**[0:09:24-0:09:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:24):**  Is that the same with pine resin?  
**[0:09:26-0:09:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:26):**  Is it any pine tree can be a source or is it specific regions on specific altitudes,  
**[0:09:31-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:31):**  et cetera, in terms of climate?  
**[0:09:33-0:09:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:33):**  What are the best places for, uh, whatever the Saudi Arabia's of pine resin basically?  
**[0:09:37-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:37):**  Yeah.  
**[0:09:38-0:09:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:38):**  Well, any pine tree produces resin and in terms of resin used for commercial purposes,  
**[0:09:43-0:09:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:43):**  certain species have a better chemical profile than others, but you know, pretty much of  
**[0:09:48-0:09:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:48):**  all the resin producing trees used commercially in the world, half of those trees are naturally  
**[0:09:54-0:09:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:54):**  occurring in Mexico.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:09:56):**  In terms of where is resin produced for global markets, Mexico is the number five producer.  
**[0:10:03-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:03):**  The top producer is China followed by Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Mexico.  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:09):**  So those are the countries that are the leader producers.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:12):**  What's exciting for me for my industry in terms of its global implications, five years  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:18):**  ago, 80% of global pine resin exports came from China.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:25):**  And today China has become a net importer of resin products.  
**[0:10:31-0:10:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:31):**  And that means a blue ocean opportunity for, you know, emerging markets, relative small  
**[0:10:38-0:10:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:38):**  producers like Mexico, where maybe a 2% of global production yet we're the number five  
**[0:10:45-0:10:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:45):**  global producer.  
**[0:10:46-0:10:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:46):**  So now that there's a new opening, 80% of markets wide open, we're seeing some new entrants  
**[0:10:51-0:10:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:51):**  get into growing their presence with pine resin, basically, you can produce pine resin  
**[0:10:56-0:10:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:56):**  anywhere, you can grow pine trees.  
**[0:10:58-0:11:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:10:58):**  And those places where we're seeing some expansion of planting trees, and the expansion is coming  
**[0:11:04-0:11:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:04):**  from, let me clarify, part of the reason China is becoming an importer, there are really  
**[0:11:09-0:11:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:09):**  two factors.  
**[0:11:10-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:10):**  One, they overexploited their natural forests for the pine resin, and so their forest integrated.  
**[0:11:17-0:11:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:17):**  And the other factor is wages have increased in China that make it less attractive economically  
**[0:11:24-0:11:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:24):**  for the tapper.  
**[0:11:26-0:11:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:26):**  So with this phenomenon, where the shift is coming, where the future of our industry is,  
**[0:11:32-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:32):**  we think about pulp and paper industry, it used to rely pulp and paper, it relied entirely  
**[0:11:38-0:11:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:38):**  on natural forests.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:39):**  Today, the industry went through a complete transition where all fiber for pulp and paper  
**[0:11:45-0:11:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:45):**  now comes from planted forests.  
**[0:11:47-0:11:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:47):**  So change that happened, say within these past 20 years.  
**[0:11:51-0:11:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:51):**  And in my view, the pine chemical industry at the beginning of that transition,  
**[0:11:55-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:55):**  almost going from hunting to farming,  
**[0:11:57-0:12:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:11:57):**  that's there you go, we sadly can no longer rely on natural forest for reliable pine resin,  
**[0:12:03-0:12:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:03):**  because deforestation, and those places that are planting forests, Brazil is the leader,  
**[0:12:09-0:12:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:09):**  where Argentina is getting in, Paraguay is interested, we have South Africa is a new  
**[0:12:15-0:12:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:15):**  player, we have people approaching us from Mozambique and Kenya, considering getting  
**[0:12:20-0:12:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:20):**  into this market, Vietnam is growing rapidly.  
**[0:12:23-0:12:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:23):**  And those countries that relied on their natural forest and didn't take care of them, they're  
**[0:12:28-0:12:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:28):**  really declining in production.  
**[0:12:29-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:29):**  That means China and Indonesia in particular.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:33):**  We have a tree nursery here where we're doing a lot of testing and experimentation.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:37):**  So you're hearing some of our tree nursery operations in the background.  
**[0:12:40-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:40):**  It's absolutely fascinating.  
**[0:12:41-0:12:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:41):**  And then what is the role or how would you describe the company you're the CEO of?  
**[0:12:46-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:46):**  So what is that part of reforestation, but also the planting site working with indigenous  
**[0:12:51-0:12:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:51):**  peoples?  
**[0:12:52-0:12:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:52):**  Like what would you in a few sentences, I mean, I did the introduction, obviously, but  
**[0:12:55-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:55):**  there's a lot more there to unpack.  
**[0:12:57-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:12:57):**  How do you normally start when you I don't know, start a talk about the company?  
**[0:13:02-0:13:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:02):**  What do you normally start with?  
**[0:13:03-0:13:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:03):**  Once you got out of the way that people understand that pine resin is a huge industry and ripe  
**[0:13:08-0:13:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:08):**  for disruption.  
**[0:13:09-0:13:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:09):**  I say at Ahead of our Day, we are chock full of innovation.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:15):**  Our company exists because the dominant business models before us were failing to meet this  
**[0:13:21-0:13:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:21):**  market demand.  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:23):**  And depending on my audience, I think, well, yeah, we are primarily a position to be a  
**[0:13:28-0:13:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:28):**  pine resin supplier.  
**[0:13:30-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:30):**  That's our primary role.  
**[0:13:31-0:13:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:31):**  We create a primary business and economic role.  
**[0:13:35-0:13:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:35):**  But I'd say our purpose is we're in the business of building transformational wealth for forest  
**[0:13:40-0:13:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:40):**  communities, industry and investors.  
**[0:13:43-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:43):**  And we do that with an innovative model to restore degraded lands, usually indigenous  
**[0:13:50-0:13:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:50):**  and community owned.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:52):**  And we have developed a finance and technology package to restore these degraded lands, establishing  
**[0:13:58-0:14:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:13:58):**  commercial agroforestry plantations that local people often call pine resin orchards.  
**[0:14:05-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:05):**  And we're building a new model for forestry plantations that incorporate culture, incorporate  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:11):**  wealth building, and not just producing a commodity.  
**[0:14:15-0:14:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:15):**  And we're doing this at a scale that has never been done before.  
**[0:14:18-0:14:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:18):**  I will definitely put the website below in the show notes.  
**[0:14:21-0:14:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:21):**  But just to walk as visually as visually as possible, because this is obviously audio  
**[0:14:26-0:14:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:26):**  through, let's say, a pine orchard.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:29):**  What should we imagine people that haven't visited?  
**[0:14:31-0:14:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:31):**  How does it look like?  
**[0:14:33-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:33):**  What do you see around you?  
**[0:14:34-0:14:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:34):**  What is different?  
**[0:14:35-0:14:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:35):**  What are things you might not expect, etc.  
**[0:14:37-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:37):**  Sure.  
**[0:14:38-0:14:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:38):**  So I work in different regions, ecoregions and climates.  
**[0:14:42-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:42):**  But our biggest region are the mountains.  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:44):**  It's called the Maseta Porto Pecha.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:46):**  We're in the mountains.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:47):**  It's populated by indigenous communities.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:49):**  A hundred years ago, the entire region was covered by a native forest of a mixed pine  
**[0:14:55-0:14:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:55):**  oak forest and a temperate climate.  
**[0:14:58-0:15:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:14:58):**  I'm talking in a region where the culture is strong.  
**[0:15:02-0:15:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:02):**  The Porto Pecha people are proud that they were never conquered.  
**[0:15:06-0:15:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:06):**  Right?  
**[0:15:07-0:15:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:07):**  They were never conquered by the Aztecs.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:08):**  They had decades long war with the Aztecs.  
**[0:15:10-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:10):**  The Aztecs never won.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:12):**  And when the Spanish came, they couldn't after 90 years of fighting, they couldn't win either.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:17):**  So I think part of that natural landscape, if you can imagine large expanse, I don't  
**[0:15:21-0:15:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:21):**  know, I'd say a thousand miles of mountains and forests and rivers, abundant, chock full  
**[0:15:27-0:15:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:27):**  of wildlife, jaguars and deer and falcons.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:32):**  And we're one of the most biodiverse regions in Mexico.  
**[0:15:35-0:15:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:35):**  And Mexico is one of the biodiverse countries in the world.  
**[0:15:39-0:15:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:39):**  So that was a hundred years ago.  
**[0:15:40-0:15:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:40):**  And since then, we've seen the region go through a massive systematic deforestation.  
**[0:15:47-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:47):**  In a hundred years, I think we've lost 70 percent of our forests.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:50):**  And that has been due to illegal logging, legal logging.  
**[0:15:54-0:16:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:15:54):**  And then one land use change that we often see is there was subsistence farming.  
**[0:16:00-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:00):**  Their soils were depleted.  
**[0:16:02-0:16:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:02):**  People introduced cattle on those areas.  
**[0:16:04-0:16:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:04):**  And then their soils get compacted and they don't even produce good pasture.  
**[0:16:08-0:16:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:08):**  So they even abandon them for cattle.  
**[0:16:10-0:16:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:10):**  Those are often degraded, depleted soils are often the lands that communities and landowners  
**[0:16:15-0:16:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:15):**  offer to introduce our tree, introduce our program.  
**[0:16:20-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:20):**  So in terms of the landscape, you know, the roads are good.  
**[0:16:23-0:16:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:23):**  Everybody has schools, everybody has health care centers.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:27):**  And when we're looking at a particular parcel, we're surrounded.  
**[0:16:30-0:16:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:30):**  The other thing that happened on the landscapes, if they didn't clear cut the land, often what  
**[0:16:35-0:16:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:35):**  came before us was a selective logging where they removed all the pine trees and they left  
**[0:16:39-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:39):**  the oak trees.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:40):**  And it ends this degraded forest, unproductive lands that isn't even, you know, there's not  
**[0:16:45-0:16:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:45):**  being used for anything.  
**[0:16:46-0:16:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:46):**  We have probably a million hectares like that, a million hectares in our region.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:52):**  So we're trying to take those lands.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:54):**  And so when we see an eligible parcel and we're trying to get a sense of that landscape,  
**[0:16:58-0:17:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:16:58):**  maybe there's corn on it today.  
**[0:17:00-0:17:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:00):**  Maybe it's just brush with a few tree, oak trees on it.  
**[0:17:03-0:17:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:03):**  And it'll be often you have remnant forest nearby.  
**[0:17:06-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:06):**  So we have these forest fragments that you can often see in the distance.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:10):**  There's probably a river or stream not too far away.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:13):**  So those are often the landscapes that we're working on, beautiful views in the mountains.  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:17):**  And you also would imagine that part of the area we're planting is the destination of  
**[0:17:22-0:17:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:22):**  the monarch butterfly.  
**[0:17:23-0:17:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:23):**  So I think you may know that the monarch butterfly travels for seven generations from Michoacán,  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:29):**  Mexico.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:30):**  They migrate up to the United States and Canada and they return back to Michoacán.  
**[0:17:35-0:17:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:35):**  And the incredible thing is they return to this very concentrated area.  
**[0:17:39-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:39):**  It's one of these wonders of nature.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:41):**  How do these butterflies know to fly for seven generations and come back to the exact same  
**[0:17:46-0:17:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:46):**  forest stands in Michoacán?  
**[0:17:48-0:17:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:48):**  We're planting in, I'd say, zones of influence around those protected habitat with our hope  
**[0:17:54-0:18:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:17:54):**  that we're offering local people an economic alternative to grow new forests, harvesting  
**[0:18:00-0:18:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:00):**  pine resin and give a little economic incentive to reduce the illegal logging that continues  
**[0:18:06-0:18:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:06):**  to threaten the habitat of the monarch butterfly.  
**[0:18:09-0:18:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:09):**  And so then you come in and you start working, you start planting.  
**[0:18:13-0:18:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:13):**  How does it look like compared to the original forest, which we might even not remember anymore,  
**[0:18:18-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:18):**  but what is it a plantation, an orchard?  
**[0:18:21-0:18:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:21):**  What should we imagine when you come in and start planting?  
**[0:18:24-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:24):**  What we see visually, I think, reflects the social constructs of where we're working.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:29):**  In Mexico, 51% of land is owned collectively by communities under, they're called ajitos.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:37):**  The ajito system was created about 100 years ago in Mexico as basically the result of a  
**[0:18:43-0:18:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:43):**  revolution and a land tenure reform where land was given for collective ownership to  
**[0:18:49-0:18:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:49):**  communities.  
**[0:18:50-0:18:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:50):**  And that aligns in a similar way with indigenous communities that have also collective ownership  
**[0:18:55-0:18:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:55):**  of the land.  
**[0:18:56-0:19:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:18:56):**  So in those communities, as a collective, where they have a general assembly, they elect  
**[0:19:00-0:19:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:00):**  their leaders every three years, and there's a process over the generations adapted to  
**[0:19:05-0:19:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:05):**  the traditional uses and customs of the people where individual families are given use of  
**[0:19:10-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:10):**  front rights to use the land.  
**[0:19:13-0:19:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:13):**  So we work with families that may be occupied and use the same parcel of land for seven  
**[0:19:18-0:19:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:18):**  generations, yet technically the owner is the community and the family is the occupant  
**[0:19:24-0:19:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:24):**  or user of that land.  
**[0:19:26-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:26):**  So when we enter a community, it needs to be with the consent of the entire community  
**[0:19:32-0:19:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:32):**  and with the interest and consent of individual family farms.  
**[0:19:36-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:36):**  And so when we're going in, sometimes they find us, say, we want to plant trees, come  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:40):**  see, take a look, or we're always looking for new places to plant and we approach them.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:47):**  And when I say them, maybe we approach a farmer, maybe we approach a community leader, but  
**[0:19:52-0:19:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:52):**  there's ultimately a process where when we're looking at parcels, we're doing it together  
**[0:19:56-0:19:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:56):**  with community elected representation, together with the farmer.  
**[0:19:59-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:19:59):**  When we agree that a parcel is eligible for our program, we want to see land that's technically  
**[0:20:07-0:20:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:07):**  apt, right?  
**[0:20:08-0:20:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:08):**  It has, it's not too steep, has the right soils.  
**[0:20:11-0:20:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:11):**  Those would be the technical considerations, but we also want to make sure the land is  
**[0:20:14-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:14):**  what I call conflict free.  
**[0:20:16-0:20:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:16):**  We want to make sure that somebody presenting us land isn't claimed by somebody else, the  
**[0:20:20-0:20:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:20):**  neighbor.  
**[0:20:21-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:21):**  So we need to have some legal documents that really help us ascertain that there's clear  
**[0:20:26-0:20:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:26):**  legal backing for the land tenure of that land.  
**[0:20:30-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:30):**  And once we get all that clear, then we come up with, we design our agroforestry designs  
**[0:20:35-0:20:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:35):**  are really curated to a specific site.  
**[0:20:38-0:20:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:38):**  So we talk as a program about regenerative agriculture, regenerative finance.  
**[0:20:43-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:43):**  One of the challenges Hido Verde seeks to address is every place is unique.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:50):**  Every community is unique.  
**[0:20:52-0:20:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:52):**  Every parcel of land is distinct.  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:20:55):**  And therefore we can not just do the exact same thing to every parcel of land where we  
**[0:21:01-0:21:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:01):**  work.  
**[0:21:02-0:21:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:02):**  And just to give you a sense of our scale, we now have 4,500 hectares under management.  
**[0:21:08-0:21:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:08):**  That's about the size of 90% of Manhattan, where the average parcel size is four hectares.  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:15):**  And we're managing, you know, about a thousand parcels today with about, I think, 750 family  
**[0:21:20-0:21:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:20):**  farms.  
**[0:21:22-0:21:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:22):**  So when we go in with that family and or that community, so we're going to have to do, first  
**[0:21:26-0:21:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:26):**  you need to clear the land for the trees and get rid of the weeds.  
**[0:21:30-0:21:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:30):**  If possible, we use mechanization to break up the compact soils.  
**[0:21:33-0:21:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:33):**  We just need to put those tractors in once to break up the soil.  
**[0:21:37-0:21:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:37):**  So we have a good loose soil for the trees to take root.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:41):**  We then plant native local trees adapted to the site.  
**[0:21:44-0:21:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:44):**  We work with about seven species of pine trees, all are endemic and local or local.  
**[0:21:51-0:21:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:51):**  And then we basically based on elevation and whatnot, you know, we choose what species  
**[0:21:56-0:21:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:56):**  are appropriate for that parcel.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:21:58):**  We introduced the initial planting.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:01):**  We adapted a model that's proven success in Brazil around planting where we do 1,100 trees  
**[0:22:07-0:22:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:07):**  planted per hectare.  
**[0:22:09-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:09):**  That's about a distance of three meters between those trees.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:13):**  And then over time, I'd say by year seven of that plantation, we reduced the density  
**[0:22:19-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:19):**  of those trees.  
**[0:22:20-0:22:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:20):**  1,100 trees gets reduced down to 800.  
**[0:22:23-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:23):**  So on the initial field, we're imagining we're having a cleared field.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:29):**  There are going to be some oak trees often around on the perimeter of where we're working.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:34):**  Why were they not cut?  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:36):**  What was the reason that the pine trees were cut and the oak trees were left standing?  
**[0:22:39-0:22:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:39):**  No commercial value.  
**[0:22:40-0:22:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:40):**  Okay.  
**[0:22:41-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:41):**  Well, very interesting from a biodiversity perspective and you leave them as well, I'm  
**[0:22:46-0:22:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:46):**  imagining.  
**[0:22:47-0:22:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:47):**  Oh yeah, sure.  
**[0:22:48-0:22:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:48):**  Sure.  
**[0:22:49-0:22:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:49):**  I mean, you can cut the pine from, so the oak from a biodiversity point of view, they're  
**[0:22:52-0:22:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:52):**  great for enriching soils, certainly great for biodiversity.  
**[0:22:56-0:23:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:22:56):**  But because these forests have been mined, we don't have a natural forest anymore.  
**[0:23:01-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:01):**  You know, these aren't even forest remnants.  
**[0:23:03-0:23:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:03):**  These are trees, right, that are left over.  
**[0:23:05-0:23:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:05):**  And sometimes the density is so, there's so many trees on a hectare of those oak that  
**[0:23:10-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:10):**  nothing will grow from a productive point of view.  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:14):**  So if we look at the point of view of nature, those oak trees left, if you leave that land  
**[0:23:19-0:23:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:19):**  untouched for 60 to 80 years, a natural forest will be restored, will come back.  
**[0:23:25-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:25):**  However, that is just a mythic false assumption that these landscapes will be left untouched  
**[0:23:31-0:23:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:31):**  for 60, 80 years.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:32):**  So in fact, they are maintained in their degraded state over the decades.  
**[0:23:37-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:37):**  They need an intervention.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:38):**  In our belief, we know, you know, think about, I mean, there's an analogy we've been hearing  
**[0:23:43-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:43):**  about the forest fires in California because of, you know, long-term lack of management,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:48):**  the lack of fire, the lack of thinning, the lack of cutting trees has made for, you know,  
**[0:23:55-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:23:55):**  an ecological disaster when those forests were cut and then not properly restored.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:01):**  So yes, to have a healthy landscape with robust biodiversity, it's my belief that many of  
**[0:24:07-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:07):**  those oak trees need to be cut down and we need to be reintroducing the restoration projects.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:12):**  We can work with those.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:13):**  Sadly, those restoration projects are underfinanced and rely pretty much on philanthropic and  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:19):**  donor money.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:20):**  And we did experiment in the early days at Hido Verde with restoration models, giving  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:24):**  trees away for people just to plant anywhere.  
**[0:24:27-0:24:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:27):**  We just found those trees didn't grow very well.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:29):**  So we then moved toward focusing on a plantation model.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:33):**  We need to see full sun on the parcels we choose to plant on.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:37):**  There are, depending on the time of year, we got a lot of, I mean, what I love, you  
**[0:24:42-0:24:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:42):**  might call them weeds here, but they're beautiful.  
**[0:24:45-0:24:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:45):**  These are pollinating plants, these, you know, flowers.  
**[0:24:49-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:49):**  So depending on the time of year, we can be surrounded by flowers of different, you know,  
**[0:24:53-0:24:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:53):**  wild flowers of different colors.  
**[0:24:55-0:24:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:55):**  But as we, that might be a starting point and there are different times of the year  
**[0:24:59-0:25:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:24:59):**  where those flowers pop up around our trees, but the areas we plant look different over  
**[0:25:04-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:04):**  time, right?  
**[0:25:05-0:25:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:05):**  When we first put that seedling in there, we do need to completely, we have an approach  
**[0:25:10-0:25:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:10):**  where we are, you know, removing, we use agrochemicals, including how to, following forest stewardship  
**[0:25:16-0:25:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:16):**  council guidelines of how do we manage weeds on the landscape that we need to do that with  
**[0:25:22-0:25:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:22):**  agrochemical interventions for the only for the first two years.  
**[0:25:26-0:25:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:26):**  So what it might look like is the parcel will have these seedlings that are very, we have  
**[0:25:33-0:25:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:33):**  great seedlings.  
**[0:25:34-0:25:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:34):**  I mean, you know, world-class, 25 centimeters and high.  
**[0:25:37-0:25:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:37):**  They're very robust.  
**[0:25:38-0:25:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:38):**  You see those on a landscape and you know, you're going to see sometimes we leave some  
**[0:25:43-0:25:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:43):**  of the ground cover.  
**[0:25:45-0:25:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:45):**  Sometimes we don't.  
**[0:25:46-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:46):**  Sometimes we're experimenting with raised beds.  
**[0:25:49-0:25:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:49):**  You know how to raise them a little bit, like little rows across a parcel and the average  
**[0:25:54-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:54):**  parcel size, you know, again, it's four hectares.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:25:57):**  That's maybe 10 acres and we have many parcels that are only one hectare in size.  
**[0:26:02-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:02):**  So that might be what you see.  
**[0:26:04-0:26:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:04):**  And the other thing that you see on these landscapes, once the trees take root, we see  
**[0:26:09-0:26:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:09):**  lots of little holes in the ground.  
**[0:26:11-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:11):**  The holes come from these rodents that live under the soils called a tusa.  
**[0:26:16-0:26:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:16):**  And these tusas love eating the young roots of crops and trees.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:21):**  So one of our biggest pests are this tusa.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:24):**  And in your landscape where we just tilled and planted the trees, you're going to see  
**[0:26:28-0:26:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:28):**  these holes, pocket holes of the tusas that are sniffing around for new food sources.  
**[0:26:34-0:26:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:34):**  And what do you do about them?  
**[0:26:36-0:26:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:36):**  Or how do you keep them?  
**[0:26:37-0:26:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:37):**  Well, this is an example of how we take combined science, traditional ecological knowledge,  
**[0:26:44-0:26:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:44):**  and we're looking at permaculture practices of how to manage this.  
**[0:26:47-0:26:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:47):**  We have tried a lot of things, a lot of things.  
**[0:26:51-0:26:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:51):**  So we do a combination.  
**[0:26:52-0:26:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:52):**  I say there are three things we're doing.  
**[0:26:54-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:54):**  One, these are animals that build tunnels under the ground.  
**[0:26:57-0:27:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:26:57):**  You know, they actually often never see the light of day and they're just thrive with  
**[0:27:01-0:27:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:01):**  the underground.  
**[0:27:02-0:27:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:02):**  So we need to break the tunnels.  
**[0:27:03-0:27:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:03):**  So if you break the tunnels around the parcel and within the parcel, you can kind of break  
**[0:27:08-0:27:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:08):**  up that network of tunnels under the ground.  
**[0:27:12-0:27:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:12):**  So that's one.  
**[0:27:13-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:13):**  We'll have to, you know, use a tractor or do it manually.  
**[0:27:17-0:27:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:17):**  You got to break up the tunnels.  
**[0:27:19-0:27:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:19):**  That's one.  
**[0:27:20-0:27:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:20):**  Two, we're now experimenting with introducing other sources of food, other plants that can  
**[0:27:25-0:27:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:25):**  grow between the trees that would attract the tusa and attract them away from the pine  
**[0:27:30-0:27:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:30):**  and toward another food source.  
**[0:27:32-0:27:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:32):**  We're experimenting with that, you know, sure we store out.  
**[0:27:35-0:27:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:35):**  And there is a technique that we use that's more of a commercial approach where there's  
**[0:27:39-0:27:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:39):**  a, basically we put, we try the approach of, I say a permaculture approach, filling the  
**[0:27:45-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:45):**  tunnels with slurry.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:47):**  You take sand and water and you try and fill them.  
**[0:27:49-0:27:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:49):**  That's very expensive, can work, but so that's, hasn't been very practical for us.  
**[0:27:55-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:27:55):**  And the other one we're using is a more commercial application where there is a gas that we can  
**[0:28:00-0:28:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:00):**  put in.  
**[0:28:01-0:28:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:01):**  It's a pellet, aluminum, it's an aluminum gas that's poisonous to the tusa.  
**[0:28:07-0:28:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:07):**  And mostly what these tusas are very smart, so they don't really die, but it scares them  
**[0:28:10-0:28:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:10):**  away.  
**[0:28:12-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:12):**  And that's these pellets that we put in to create a gas within the tunnel corridors.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:18):**  And from what year can you like imagine harvesting and any, like you mentioned from seven years  
**[0:28:24-0:28:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:24):**  on we're thinning probably the most productive ones are ones that have taken the best root.  
**[0:28:29-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:29):**  What does a, they can grow 80 to a hundred years you've mentioned, but from when do you  
**[0:28:33-0:28:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:33):**  start seeing an interesting raisin coming off a plot normally?  
**[0:28:39-0:28:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:39):**  Great question.  
**[0:28:40-0:28:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:40):**  So in our temperate climate, the trees we plant today, we need to take care of them  
**[0:28:44-0:28:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:44):**  for about 10 years until they can be ready to start producing resin and revenue.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:50):**  And after that time, the trees can be harvested for resin for their natural life, which is  
**[0:28:56-0:28:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:56):**  80 to a hundred years.  
**[0:28:58-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:58):**  So that brings up a finance question.  
**[0:28:59-0:29:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:28:59):**  I can imagine.  
**[0:29:00-0:29:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:00):**  You better believe it.  
**[0:29:01-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:01):**  We're looking at a business cycle.  
**[0:29:04-0:29:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:04):**  It's 20 year term.  
**[0:29:06-0:29:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:06):**  That's one of the delicious challenges I'm leaning into is how do we invite investors  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:12):**  to think about time differently in my background in finance?  
**[0:29:16-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:16):**  And typically you are looking for projects to three to five years, 10 years is a long  
**[0:29:21-0:29:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:21):**  time and I'm looking for 20 year money.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:23):**  Aren't too many of them.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:25):**  Now the money that's out there of 20 year term, when we look at forestry commercially,  
**[0:29:31-0:29:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:31):**  there are these financial institutions called TMOs, timber investment management organizations,  
**[0:29:36-0:29:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:36):**  and they are used to funding forestry with a 20 year timeframe.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:40):**  However, they want monocultures and they want large scale, like 50,000 hectare farms, and  
**[0:29:46-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:46):**  they want private property, private property, monoculture.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:48):**  Basically all the things you don't have.  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:51):**  Correct.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:52):**  TMOs that we'll think 20 years won't look at us, we're a niche product and we're working  
**[0:29:56-0:30:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:29:56):**  on community owned land, which most investors won't invest in.  
**[0:30:00-0:30:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:00):**  We had to solve for how to invest in land where private title does not exist.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:05):**  That's part of our innovation.  
**[0:30:07-0:30:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:07):**  And in terms of who's stepping up, who are the investors that step up with this kind  
**[0:30:11-0:30:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:11):**  of timeframe?  
**[0:30:12-0:30:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:12):**  No, we developed a blended or integrated capital structure.  
**[0:30:16-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:16):**  We rely on a variety of sources of capital.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:19):**  We have equity, mezzanine debt, and donations and subsidies.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:23):**  And we've been able to structure investments for less than 20 years, but more than 10.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:30):**  And so that really takes a very special kind of investor that's willing to think that long  
**[0:30:34-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:34):**  term.  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:36):**  And I think our value proposition and the investor stepping forward, it's not just about  
**[0:30:40-0:30:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:40):**  financial reward and financial risk, but they're all valuing what's the impact.  
**[0:30:47-0:30:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:47):**  That's what some call social return on investment.  
**[0:30:50-0:30:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:50):**  The number one interest we're seeing in investors is climate solutions.  
**[0:30:55-0:30:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:55):**  We see a lot of people, how do we create solutions to climate on land use?  
**[0:30:59-0:31:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:30:59):**  And I'd say there's a secondary interest, investors stepping up with us, are investors  
**[0:31:04-0:31:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:04):**  excited about creating solutions to wealth inequality?  
**[0:31:08-0:31:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:08):**  So how big of a difference does that make on wealth and inequality?  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:13):**  If a family decides to work with you on the land they manage, they don't own, but they  
**[0:31:18-0:31:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:18):**  manage, what are you able to offer them?  
**[0:31:20-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:20):**  Or how big of a difference are you making to a family like that?  
**[0:31:23-0:31:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:23):**  That may come with a hectare or with four, or I don't know what the average one is.  
**[0:31:28-0:31:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:28):**  Okay.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:29):**  So we have a radical business model.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:32):**  And if I look at the value creation, I'm going to answer your question directly in a minute.  
**[0:31:37-0:31:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:37):**  First, I'm going to give you an indirect answer.  
**[0:31:39-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:39):**  If we look at that, all the money I'm spending or we're investing in planting trees and then  
**[0:31:43-0:31:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:43):**  you get the resin out of the tree and then it gets sold to industry and industry makes  
**[0:31:47-0:31:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:47):**  a profit.  
**[0:31:48-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:48):**  And then Hido Verde makes a profit and we give money to investors.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:52):**  If you look at wealth sharing in our business model, our value creation model, most models,  
**[0:31:58-0:32:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:31:58):**  agricultural models, 90% of the value creation wealth gets captured by industry and investors.  
**[0:32:05-0:32:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:05):**  10% stays with the farmer at best.  
**[0:32:08-0:32:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:08):**  In our model, 90% of the wealth is captured by forest communities and farmers.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:13):**  And 10% goes to industry and investors.  
**[0:32:17-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:17):**  And why I think we can still offer an attractive financial return on those terms.  
**[0:32:22-0:32:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:22):**  And the other radical innovation people call me crazy, that we're building an asset that  
**[0:32:28-0:32:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:28):**  we don't own.  
**[0:32:30-0:32:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:30):**  Communities are building assets.  
**[0:32:32-0:32:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:32):**  So in our view, the 12,000 hectares we're planting over a 30 year period will create  
**[0:32:37-0:32:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:37):**  a billion dollars of wealth for forest communities and farmers.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:40):**  If I break that down to the individual farmer and what that might look like for them, where  
**[0:32:46-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:46):**  they're living, if you have many farmers are living with a subsistence wage, they should  
**[0:32:50-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:50):**  see anywhere between a three to five X increase in their income, giving them an annual income  
**[0:32:56-0:33:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:32:56):**  equivalent to a white collar worker in a place like Lisbon, Madrid, or Mexico city.  
**[0:33:02-0:33:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:02):**  The numbers I'm doing today, what does that look like?  
**[0:33:04-0:33:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:04):**  Well, I mean, I mean, I'll just leave it at that in terms of the amount of wealth creation  
**[0:33:10-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:10):**  for a family.  
**[0:33:11-0:33:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:11):**  Inflation can make it more difficult, but it's that it's significant the difference.  
**[0:33:15-0:33:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:15):**  I think that's that.  
**[0:33:16-0:33:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:16):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:17):**  And what I would tell you, and when we're doing this, not just with one family, but  
**[0:33:20-0:33:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:20):**  maybe we're doing it with 100 or 200 families in a community and they're all doing this  
**[0:33:25-0:33:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:25):**  is having a catalytic effect of propelling entire communities into the middle class.  
**[0:33:31-0:33:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:31):**  So I think it's phenomenal wealth creation.  
**[0:33:33-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:33):**  And we're seeing this.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:34):**  People who are successful in tapping now can afford to send their kids for university education.  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:41):**  So to me, that's one of my vision of a transformational wealth is when we have one percent of the  
**[0:33:46-0:33:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:46):**  population that we work with get a university education.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:50):**  That's going to change with the Hido Verde and the resin orchards we're building.  
**[0:33:54-0:33:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:54):**  How much time does it take to be, let's say, four hectares?  
**[0:33:58-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:33:58):**  You mentioned this is the average.  
**[0:34:00-0:34:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:00):**  Is that a full time job for a full family?  
**[0:34:03-0:34:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:03):**  Is it something you do on the side while doing other things?  
**[0:34:07-0:34:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:07):**  What's the average?  
**[0:34:08-0:34:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:08):**  Is it very difficult as well to learn to tap properly?  
**[0:34:10-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:10):**  No, no, it's not hard to learn.  
**[0:34:11-0:34:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:11):**  It does take, it's hard work in the beginning, you know, learning a new skill like that can  
**[0:34:15-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:15):**  be hard work.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:16):**  Over time you get efficient.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:17):**  And in terms of how much money they might make from this activity.  
**[0:34:21-0:34:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:21):**  So in the Hido Verde model, we provide all the financing required to get those plantations  
**[0:34:27-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:27):**  producing.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:28):**  This cost to us is about five thousand dollars US per hectare we spend over that ten year  
**[0:34:35-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:35):**  period rate of initial plantation and maintenance.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:39):**  Most of that money is spent in the first three years and most of that money is spent for  
**[0:34:44-0:34:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:44):**  local people to plant and tend those forests.  
**[0:34:48-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:48):**  So if that farming family wants it, they earn for planting and take care of the trees.  
**[0:34:54-0:34:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:54):**  And we have, today we have twelve hundred people working full time equivalent under  
**[0:34:58-0:35:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:34:58):**  that regime where they're taking care of the trees being planted and they're earning an  
**[0:35:03-0:35:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:03):**  income equivalent to I say one point eight times above the minimum livable wage.  
**[0:35:10-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:10):**  We define the minimum livable wage in Mexico based on an economic institute.  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:15):**  But the real money comes in the resin ten years later, right, when we're tapping.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:19):**  So in terms of how many people that will employ depends on the efficiency, but we would expect  
**[0:35:24-0:35:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:24):**  that two hectares would be enough for a full time job if that's what they want.  
**[0:35:31-0:35:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:31):**  Many tappers in the world are like many farming communities, they want to have diverse sources  
**[0:35:36-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:36):**  of income.  
**[0:35:37-0:35:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:37):**  So most people tapping have other sources of income.  
**[0:35:40-0:35:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:40):**  They have cattle, they have corn, some tappers are lawyers and doctors and they do this as  
**[0:35:46-0:35:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:46):**  well, you know.  
**[0:35:47-0:35:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:47):**  So their model allows for people can choose if they want this to be a full time activity,  
**[0:35:52-0:35:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:52):**  do they want this to be a family employment activity?  
**[0:35:55-0:36:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:35:55):**  And we have many cases where the farmer who has the land might be sixty years old, the  
**[0:36:01-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:01):**  kids don't live here anymore, so they're looking for higher people.  
**[0:36:04-0:36:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:04):**  So it's creating employment for their neighbors to work their parcel.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:09):**  I think when fully realized, Hido Verde will become one of the largest employers in Michoacan,  
**[0:36:15-0:36:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:15):**  bringing about one percent of the state's employment, you know, ten thousand people.  
**[0:36:19-0:36:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:19):**  And what should smart investors, let's imagine the room is full of them listening to this,  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:24):**  what should they take away from your experience until now?  
**[0:36:27-0:36:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:27):**  And obviously it's going to continue and expand and get a lot more concrete as many more parcels  
**[0:36:33-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:33):**  get to the 10 year, et cetera.  
**[0:36:35-0:36:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:35):**  What would you tell a group of investors that is interested in these kind of models, maybe  
**[0:36:39-0:36:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:39):**  not specifically in Mexico, as this is obviously not investment advice, but also in other places?  
**[0:36:45-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:45):**  What would be your main pointers to a group of investors if we would be, let's say, on  
**[0:36:50-0:36:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:50):**  stage talking about this?  
**[0:36:52-0:36:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:52):**  I find having worked with investors for a few decades now, I'm very pointed, modern  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:36:57):**  portfolio, modern portfolio theory that has most of us as a paradigm thinking 10 years  
**[0:37:02-0:37:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:02):**  maximum term investment with a very specific approach to diversifying and mitigating risk.  
**[0:37:09-0:37:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:09):**  And it's clearly a model that's worked under the old economic paradigm.  
**[0:37:13-0:37:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:13):**  We've amassed unprecedented amount of wealth with modern portfolio theory.  
**[0:37:18-0:37:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:18):**  However, a few of us, well, that's right.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:21):**  The one percenters, the one percenters of the world have accrued massive wealth under  
**[0:37:26-0:37:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:26):**  this model.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:27):**  The 99 percent or 90 percent of us haven't necessarily benefit financially in the same  
**[0:37:33-0:37:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:33):**  way.  
**[0:37:34-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:34):**  So we often mitigate our risk.  
**[0:37:35-0:37:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:35):**  We want clear exits, three to five year term with exits.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:39):**  And yet every time I step back and say, let's look at those great companies in the world.  
**[0:37:44-0:37:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:44):**  What's a great company?  
**[0:37:45-0:37:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:45):**  I mean, we have different criteria, great globally important companies, Microsoft, Google,  
**[0:37:50-0:37:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:50):**  any of them, any of them, none of them got to their success following a three to five  
**[0:37:54-0:38:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:37:54):**  year timeline off promising a five year exit with outsized returns.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:00):**  They get to success by pursuing a long term vision and realizing that long term vision.  
**[0:38:06-0:38:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:06):**  So I think as investors, we really need to think about how do we I think we really need  
**[0:38:10-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:10):**  to think about the time differently.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:12):**  And if we want to build great companies to build transformational change in the world,  
**[0:38:16-0:38:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:16):**  we can't be using the same kind of logic that got us into the hole that we're in today in  
**[0:38:20-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:20):**  terms of a climate crisis.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:22):**  And so I would say, one, we need to think differently about time.  
**[0:38:25-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:25):**  We need to think differently about risk.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:27):**  I think the tools we use to measure and mitigate risk need to be updated.  
**[0:38:33-0:38:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:33):**  And the analogy I would give is the following.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:36):**  You know, in the 1970s, people said you could never lend to poor people because they're  
**[0:38:40-0:38:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:40):**  bad credit risk.  
**[0:38:41-0:38:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:41):**  They have no assets, no guarantees.  
**[0:38:44-0:38:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:44):**  Then we have Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, the innovative peer lending.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:48):**  And in my view as an economist, what they innovated was how do we monetize social capital  
**[0:38:53-0:38:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:53):**  when you have a group of poor women with no assets or savings, yet that group and the  
**[0:38:59-0:39:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:38:59):**  promise of one member of the group doesn't repay the other members repay.  
**[0:39:03-0:39:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:03):**  That I call social capital.  
**[0:39:05-0:39:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:05):**  And by creating the social capital and they began to prove that you can actually demonstrate  
**[0:39:10-0:39:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:10):**  very high repayment rates.  
**[0:39:12-0:39:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:12):**  And there are, you know, high 96, 98% repayment rate of these poor uncredit worthy lending  
**[0:39:20-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:20):**  groups.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:21):**  That experience then gave rise to microfinance.  
**[0:39:24-0:39:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:24):**  I think some argue impact investors got involved with microfinancing.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:28):**  Today, microfinancing is a robust segment of the economy.  
**[0:39:33-0:39:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:33):**  It's no longer unproven.  
**[0:39:35-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:35):**  Yet it took those early investors, philanthropists, government and investors to really think differently  
**[0:39:41-0:39:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:41):**  about risk and return.  
**[0:39:43-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:43):**  And we now have an extremely robust microfinance industry with very attractive offerings for  
**[0:39:50-0:39:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:50):**  investors.  
**[0:39:51-0:39:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:51):**  And I believe we're at a point in time with our climate emergency, we need to really be  
**[0:39:55-0:39:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:55):**  thinking differently.  
**[0:39:56-0:40:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:39:56):**  So I would invite any investor who's interested in the kind of thing I'm talking about, then  
**[0:40:00-0:40:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:00):**  we got to take we got to take a percent of our portfolio that we can take some outsized  
**[0:40:05-0:40:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:05):**  risks.  
**[0:40:06-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:06):**  And I am talking about outsized risks, because there's no other option.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:09):**  If we want a planet that is not worse than what we received, we have a planetary emergency,  
**[0:40:15-0:40:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:15):**  we need to think differently.  
**[0:40:17-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:17):**  We're doing it.  
**[0:40:18-0:40:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:18):**  And I would say when people say it's risky, it's unproven, I would say I'm working with  
**[0:40:22-0:40:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:22):**  a family that's been successful, making money with perpetual dividends for 90 years.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:28):**  Imagine that perpetual dividends for 90 years, they want no exit.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:32):**  This is a perpetual dividend model that can exist into perpetuity.  
**[0:40:36-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:36):**  So I'm excited about that as a new vision of wealth building.  
**[0:40:40-0:40:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:40):**  And I'm excited that we need to find investors have their needs met to participate in systemic  
**[0:40:44-0:40:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:44):**  change.  
**[0:40:45-0:40:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:45):**  And of course, we all need to make a profit.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:47):**  But we really need to be thinking differently about risk and reward.  
**[0:40:50-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:50):**  That would be one.  
**[0:40:51-0:40:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:51):**  And as a final comment, I would say to investors, I've heard so often that we got a lot of money  
**[0:40:55-0:40:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:55):**  and there's a lack of pipeline, there's a lack of deals.  
**[0:40:58-0:41:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:40:58):**  Where's the investor ready opportunity?  
**[0:41:01-0:41:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:01):**  And when we're really pushing the envelope of innovation the way we're describing, and  
**[0:41:05-0:41:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:05):**  even if we're doing more conventional venture finance deals, investors need to co-create  
**[0:41:10-0:41:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:10):**  the opportunity with the entrepreneurs.  
**[0:41:13-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:13):**  We can't just look to entrepreneurs and say, I want that investment ready product, show  
**[0:41:17-0:41:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:17):**  me the papers I can sign.  
**[0:41:19-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:19):**  These deals are curating deals with investors.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:21):**  We're building this together.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:22):**  And I'm building multimillion dollar investment opportunities.  
**[0:41:26-0:41:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:26):**  So I would say investors, if we're really serious about regenerative finance, investors  
**[0:41:31-0:41:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:31):**  need to be co-creators.  
**[0:41:33-0:41:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:33):**  And if the individual wealth holder doesn't have the time or skills to be that active  
**[0:41:37-0:41:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:37):**  co-creator, then they need partners, financial advisors, funds that can play the co-creation  
**[0:41:44-0:41:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:44):**  role.  
**[0:41:45-0:41:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:45):**  I do not accept that I've heard for many years, and I don't accept the false notion that there's  
**[0:41:52-0:41:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:52):**  a lack of investment ready opportunities.  
**[0:41:55-0:41:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:55):**  So what if we flip the conversation?  
**[0:41:56-0:42:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:41:56):**  What if you would be in charge of, let's say, a billion dollar investment fund, which can  
**[0:42:01-0:42:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:01):**  have a very, very long term view, but it's definitely investment fund.  
**[0:42:05-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:05):**  What would you focus on?  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:06):**  What are the crucial bits?  
**[0:42:08-0:42:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:08):**  Could be in the sector you're in now, but could also be completely something else.  
**[0:42:11-0:42:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:11):**  Regenerative aquaculture.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:12):**  It could be seaweeds.  
**[0:42:14-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:14):**  Could be satellite monitoring.  
**[0:42:15-0:42:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:15):**  What would you, if you're no longer running this company, but running this fund, what  
**[0:42:20-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:20):**  would you be selecting as your top priorities?  
**[0:42:22-0:42:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:22):**  I don't need to know until the dollar, like the dollar amount is exactly what you would  
**[0:42:26-0:42:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:26):**  invest in, but what would be your top X things you'd be interested in if you had a very large  
**[0:42:32-0:42:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:32):**  amount of resources?  
**[0:42:33-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:33):**  Yeah, I guess I'm going to dream a little bit, you know, not a very practical dream,  
**[0:42:38-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:38):**  but I would want to do it all.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:40):**  So I want to build an ecosystem, right?  
**[0:42:42-0:42:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:42):**  Money I see money, we're talking about regeneration.  
**[0:42:44-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:44):**  Money is the blood in an ecosystem.  
**[0:42:47-0:42:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:47):**  It needs to flow.  
**[0:42:48-0:42:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:48):**  And if it gets, you know, I sometimes feel like the hoarding of wealth is like a blood  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:52):**  clot in our circulatory system.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:54):**  So we have too much concentration of wealth or too much hoarding.  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:57):**  It's unhealthy for the whole system.  
**[0:42:58-0:43:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:42:58):**  So let's get that money flowing.  
**[0:43:00-0:43:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:00):**  And I think that I would have some business development money, some grant money for business  
**[0:43:04-0:43:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:04):**  development, promising early opportunities, but they aren't quite ready, but need some  
**[0:43:08-0:43:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:08):**  technical assistance or investment readiness monies.  
**[0:43:11-0:43:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:11):**  I would then have another layer of what I would call, you know, seed stage round.  
**[0:43:15-0:43:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:15):**  I'd love to see some round of seed stage funding, early stage companies taking the stuff I'm  
**[0:43:20-0:43:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:20):**  looking at, my friends and what I'm talking about.  
**[0:43:22-0:43:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:22):**  I'm talking about kelp.  
**[0:43:23-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:23):**  Kelp.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:24):**  Kelp.  
**[0:43:25-0:43:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:25):**  It's a revolution beginning in Alaska with the EAC.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:29):**  It's unbelievable.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:30):**  It's a multi-billion dollar market opportunity that's going to be part of our future.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:33):**  The source of protein, I think it sequesters carbon, I don't know, 10 times more than terrestrial  
**[0:43:39-0:43:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:39):**  forest.  
**[0:43:40-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:40):**  So I see market opportunity.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:41):**  It's good for health, good for ocean health and great economic opportunity.  
**[0:43:44-0:43:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:44):**  Very early.  
**[0:43:45-0:43:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:45):**  It's an industry in its infancy that's going to scale.  
**[0:43:47-0:43:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:47):**  And I'll use that as an analogy, grant money on development, maybe some venture funding  
**[0:43:52-0:43:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:52):**  for some early, you know, smaller companies.  
**[0:43:54-0:43:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:54):**  And then there might be some more larger investments for growth scale.  
**[0:43:59-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:43:59):**  Maybe I might argue in a heat of our days at that level.  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:01):**  And then, you know, if you got so much money, then you might look for some more mature business  
**[0:44:05-0:44:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:05):**  opportunities in terms of what kinds of sectors that excite me.  
**[0:44:10-0:44:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:10):**  I think the whole issue of soil and nutrients and that's going to be a business both in  
**[0:44:13-0:44:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:13):**  terms of how do we make soils healthy.  
**[0:44:16-0:44:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:16):**  There's a big business that's not well developed there, monetizing carbon that accelerate this  
**[0:44:21-0:44:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:21):**  transformation just, you know, toward a regenerative sustainable future.  
**[0:44:25-0:44:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:25):**  I think there's opportunities in there, but complicated.  
**[0:44:28-0:44:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:28):**  And in terms of things, I think if we look with the circular system, a friend of mine  
**[0:44:32-0:44:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:32):**  has an amazing company where this will be a great example of the new kinds of companies  
**[0:44:37-0:44:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:37):**  we need.  
**[0:44:38-0:44:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:38):**  He's making fabric for textiles and he's sourcing from agricultural waste.  
**[0:44:43-0:44:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:43):**  So he's turning agricultural waste into commercial grade fabrics for clothing and manufacturing.  
**[0:44:49-0:44:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:49):**  And he's also repurposing garments for that fabric.  
**[0:44:53-0:44:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:53):**  So that to me is a very interesting kind of model.  
**[0:44:55-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:44:55):**  And if you want to look at where are those, I would be looking where our industry is fragmented,  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:00):**  where there's fragmentation in the industry, where there's an innovation that offers to  
**[0:45:04-0:45:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:04):**  be the first or second in its group, you know, growth opportunity.  
**[0:45:09-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:09):**  And I'm involved with a fund.  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:10):**  We just invest in a company that's doing EV recharging stations, you know, just that.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:15):**  So just in terms of our move to electric cars and the network of charging stations that  
**[0:45:19-0:45:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:19):**  we need.  
**[0:45:20-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:20):**  Well, we just funded a re-adventure capital, put money into a company doing that.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:25):**  I think that's another example of the kinds of things we could be doing with a billion  
**[0:45:28-0:45:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:28):**  dollars.  
**[0:45:29-0:45:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:29):**  In my heart of hearts, where I would really want to push the envelope is we need to find  
**[0:45:33-0:45:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:33):**  a way for capital markets to be more inclusive of indigenous people worldwide.  
**[0:45:38-0:45:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:38):**  And capitalist system has largely failed indigenous people.  
**[0:45:42-0:45:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:42):**  And I think we're in a new day where there's new models, new ways to think about business  
**[0:45:46-0:45:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:46):**  and finance that are really reinvigorating traditional cultures, tapping their traditional  
**[0:45:52-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:52):**  knowledge to create the solutions we need as we move into this next century in a way  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:45:57):**  that honors the past and creates the, you know, dynamic solutions for the future.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:02):**  It might sound like a little polemic, but I'll just give you an example.  
**[0:46:06-0:46:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:06):**  We're working to adapt the adaptation of traditional knowledge that's working with scientists.  
**[0:46:12-0:46:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:12):**  We're taking pine resin and we believe we have a product that can substitute glyphosates,  
**[0:46:16-0:46:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:16):**  right?  
**[0:46:17-0:46:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:17):**  Glyphosate, you probably know, our listeners know is one of the most.  
**[0:46:21-0:46:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:21):**  We had Seg Bush on the call.  
**[0:46:22-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:22):**  Yeah.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:23):**  It's the most widely used pesticide in the world.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:25):**  I think it's used on 80% of the world's food and the environmentalists among us are really  
**[0:46:30-0:46:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:30):**  unhappy with the toxic effects of the healthcare workers as well and the healthcare workers.  
**[0:46:36-0:46:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:36):**  So what is an 80% of the world's food relies on this product.  
**[0:46:40-0:46:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:40):**  What are we going to do to eliminate the need or substitute it?  
**[0:46:44-0:46:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:44):**  I'm very excited about a product we're working on.  
**[0:46:46-0:46:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:46):**  It's a bio based substitute for glyphosates and that was informed by traditional knowledge  
**[0:46:51-0:46:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:51):**  and science.  
**[0:46:53-0:46:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:53):**  And I, that would be an early stage company.  
**[0:46:55-0:46:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:55):**  It's Australian company that I would take a look at investing in.  
**[0:46:59-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:46:59):**  So I hope that might give a flavor of the kinds of opportunities I would be excited  
**[0:47:03-0:47:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:47:03):**  about with a billion dollars.  
**[0:47:05-0:47:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:47:05):**  I think it gives a very good flavor of that and I want to be conscious of your time and  
**[0:47:10-0:47:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:47:10):**  thank you so much.  
**[0:47:11-0:47:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:47:11):**  I think it's also a good ending to, I don't think the last time we talked because there's  
**[0:47:14-0:47:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:47:14):**  so much more to unpack in this model and the rest of your work, but I think we leave it  
**[0:47:19-0:47:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:47:19):**  at that for now and thank you so much for joining us and obviously for the great work

**[0:50:02-0:50:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:02):**  so you don't have to ride along.  
**[0:50:04-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:04):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:50:09-0:50:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:09):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:15-0:50:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:15):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:50:19-0:50:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:19):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:21-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:21):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:26-0:50:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:26):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:50:34-0:50:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:34):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:50:36-0:50:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:36):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:50:37-0:50:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:37):**  Unfortunately, that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:40):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:44-0:50:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:44):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:50:46-0:50:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/shaun-paul#t=0:50:46):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.
