**[0:00:12-0:00:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:12):**  Now onto the podcast.  
**[0:00:14-0:00:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:14):**  Finally after a year and a half, even more, after the summer of 2020 an update with Benedict  
**[0:00:18-0:00:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:18):**  Beuzel, one of the leading farmers applying regenerative practices, at scale in Europe.  
**[0:00:25-0:00:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:25):**  Farming over 3000 hectares of which 2000 forestry and 1000 organic grain in a very very dry  
**[0:00:31-0:00:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:31):**  area east of Berlin.  
**[0:00:33-0:00:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:33):**  We talk about what has changed and how the on-farm experimentation even in the forestry  
**[0:00:37-0:00:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:37):**  part has simply exploded and what were the crucial elements to have this crazy growth.  
**[0:00:44-0:00:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:44):**  And we talk about where are we in this regenerative evolution and how we really really don't know  
**[0:00:50-0:00:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:50):**  anything.  
**[0:00:53-0:00:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:53):**  Welcome to another episode of Investing in Regenerative Agriculture, Investing as if the  
**[0:00:58-0:00:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:58):**  Planet Mattered.  
**[0:00:59-0:01:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:00:59):**  A podcast show where I talk to the pioneers in the regenerative food and agriculture space  
**[0:01:03-0:01:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:03):**  to learn more on how to put our money to work to regenerate soil, people, local communities  
**[0:01:09-0:01:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:09):**  and ecosystems while making an appropriate and fair return.  
**[0:01:13-0:01:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:13):**  Why am I focused on soil and regeneration?  
**[0:01:15-0:01:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:15):**  Because so many of the pressing issues we face today have their roots in how we treat  
**[0:01:19-0:01:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:19):**  our land, grow our food and what we eat and it's time that we as investors, big and small  
**[0:01:24-0:01:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:24):**  and consumers start paying much more attention to the dirt slash soil underneath our feet.  
**[0:01:31-0:01:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:31):**  In March last year we launched our membership community to make it easy for fans to support  
**[0:01:35-0:01:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:35):**  our work and so many of you have joined as a member.  
**[0:01:38-0:01:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:38):**  We've launched different types of benefits, exclusive content, Q&A webinars with former  
**[0:01:42-0:01:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:42):**  guests, ask me anything sessions plus so much more to come in the future.  
**[0:01:46-0:01:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:46):**  For more information on the different tiers, benefits and how to become a member check

**[0:01:55-0:01:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:55):**  Thank you.  
**[0:01:56-0:02:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:01:56):**  Welcome to another episode today with my good friend Benedikt Boezel who's back after the  
**[0:02:03-0:02:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:03):**  series we did and we just looked at when we released the last one which was in the summer  
**[0:02:07-0:02:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:07):**  of 2020 and so much has changed.  
**[0:02:09-0:02:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:09):**  So we're checking in with one of the most interesting regenerative farmers or farmers  
**[0:02:13-0:02:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:13):**  using regenerative practices on a large scale farm and forestry farm actually east of Berlin  
**[0:02:19-0:02:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:19):**  and I'm so happy to have you back here and to check in.  
**[0:02:22-0:02:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:22):**  It's going to be a full episode.  
**[0:02:23-0:02:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:23):**  There's a lot to discuss so let's see if we can squeeze it into an hour or a bit less  
**[0:02:28-0:02:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:28):**  and otherwise we do another one in six months or so because it seems like the speed of change  
**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:32):**  has only picked up so there's so much to unpack.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:35):**  Welcome Benedikt.  
**[0:02:36-0:02:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:36):**  Hi Koen, thank you so much for the invitation.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:39):**  Good to see you.  
**[0:02:40-0:02:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:40):**  And I mean it's horrible to say but can you give us a brief overview, it's not brief,  
**[0:02:44-0:02:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:44):**  but let's say the summer, if you're thinking back on the summer of 2020, we just came out  
**[0:02:48-0:02:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:48):**  of the first lockdown, we had no idea of COVID, how long that was going to take, etc.  
**[0:02:53-0:02:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:53):**  And now you're feeling now we're talking let's say the middle of winter or the end of winter  
**[0:02:58-0:03:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:02:58):**  in 2022, what's the biggest feeling of change?  
**[0:03:03-0:03:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:03):**  How do you feel most different?  
**[0:03:04-0:03:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:04):**  I mean private is another story but definitely around the farm.  
**[0:03:08-0:03:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:08):**  What's your biggest shift or what's your biggest change that you feel somebody put you there  
**[0:03:12-0:03:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:12):**  and said okay you have five words to answer that?  
**[0:03:16-0:03:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:16):**  That's a tough one.  
**[0:03:17-0:03:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:17):**  I mean really there's no private life and farm life, it's all just one big thing I guess.  
**[0:03:27-0:03:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:27):**  So I would have to say the birth of my daughter in May last year definitely had by far the  
**[0:03:34-0:03:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:34):**  biggest impact.  
**[0:03:35-0:03:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:35):**  So all the farming changes are disappearing compared to family expansion, which I think  
**[0:03:41-0:03:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:41):**  most people can agree on.  
**[0:03:42-0:03:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:42):**  And when you look at the farm or the land or the farming company, what do you see has  
**[0:03:48-0:03:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:48):**  shifted in that year and a half, which seems so long ago if we think about it.  
**[0:03:54-0:03:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:54):**  Yeah it's incredible to think about, I mean one and a half years is really not that long  
**[0:03:59-0:04:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:03:59):**  but like I can't really think back to it anymore.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:02):**  I think what's the biggest shift is that the energy that I was carrying around in my heart,  
**[0:04:09-0:04:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:09):**  in my head is now actually starting to become real outside because we've just been able  
**[0:04:15-0:04:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:15):**  to grow the team so strongly and just have the most incredible people with us that I  
**[0:04:23-0:04:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:23):**  just have the biggest respect and love for them and what they do outside is just incredible.  
**[0:04:28-0:04:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:28):**  And to see that happen is quite touching to be honest with you.  
**[0:04:33-0:04:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:33):**  It's still hard work and a tough life but it's beautiful to see what can happen if you  
**[0:04:39-0:04:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:39):**  just stick with it and take some risks I guess.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:42):**  And so let's unpack that a bit.  
**[0:04:44-0:04:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:44):**  How were you able to grow the team because of course you had a farming team back in the  
**[0:04:49-0:04:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:49):**  day when we talked but not so much on the regenerative side and now there's a full suite.  
**[0:04:54-0:04:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:54):**  So walk us through how many people are there now on the farm and you say grow the team  
**[0:04:59-0:05:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:04:59):**  it could also be from one to two and that's a huge growth but in this case we talk about  
**[0:05:03-0:05:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:03):**  a slightly different growth and how did you, were you able to bring them to the farm and  
**[0:05:07-0:05:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:07):**  how did you find all these people?  
**[0:05:08-0:05:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:08):**  Yeah that's a good question.  
**[0:05:10-0:05:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:10):**  It's always to be kind of difficult to make sense of it looking back.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:13):**  Most of the time it always makes sense when you look back but in this case things just  
**[0:05:18-0:05:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:18):**  happen naturally I think.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:20):**  I think that's one of the things that I found if you're lucky enough to find what you are  
**[0:05:26-0:05:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:26):**  supposed to do in life which I was looking for 15 years of my life doing finance and  
**[0:05:31-0:05:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:31):**  all the other stuff and if that is in line with what's needed at that point in your context  
**[0:05:36-0:05:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:36):**  and this is for me agriculture in a very dry environment then I think there's something  
**[0:05:43-0:05:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:43):**  like energy of the universe that helps you.  
**[0:05:46-0:05:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:46):**  If you do shit of course then it's not going to help you hopefully but if you have a good  
**[0:05:51-0:05:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:51):**  path that makes sense for the context and the environment then there's some weird form  
**[0:05:55-0:05:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:55):**  of support, serendipity all over the place.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:05:58):**  It's just really, I don't know.  
**[0:06:00-0:06:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:00):**  But yeah I mean back in the day, I mean we already had a few in the regenerative team  
**[0:06:10-0:06:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:10):**  I guess but quite a few of them were just interns and back in the day we'd had no financial  
**[0:06:15-0:06:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:15):**  means, we were extremely struggling with the forest company, with the agriculture company,  
**[0:06:21-0:06:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:21):**  we had been in a drought for two or three years in a row, we couldn't do any investments,  
**[0:06:26-0:06:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:26):**  we had bad liquidity.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:28):**  And it still is just insanely tough in this environment, in this region to do agriculture  
**[0:06:34-0:06:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:34):**  or forestry especially if you want to do it in a let's say healthy way.  
**[0:06:38-0:06:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:38):**  And what made us strong back in the day was that I had the people that were doing an internship  
**[0:06:44-0:06:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:44):**  and they had no pay, they didn't get any food, they were just with us because they believed  
**[0:06:50-0:06:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:50):**  in what we were doing and what we were believing and I guess they trusted me that I can somehow  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:06:56):**  find a way to finally also maybe pay them something.  
**[0:07:00-0:07:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:00):**  So I think we were just a few, a handful at that time that believed that there is something  
**[0:07:05-0:07:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:05):**  that we should push and keep doing because I mean when we started planting the first  
**[0:07:10-0:07:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:10):**  trees in an agroforestry system and I swapped my cow against the cows, I always thought  
**[0:07:17-0:07:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:17):**  before the money runs out I'll find people who understand why we do what we do and also  
**[0:07:21-0:07:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:21):**  understand why it's important to do it.  
**[0:07:24-0:07:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:24):**  Therefore will start to support us and as always in life things take a bit longer and  
**[0:07:28-0:07:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:28):**  are a bit more expensive than you expect them.  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:31):**  You mean that it took a bit longer before the money ran out?  
**[0:07:34-0:07:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:34):**  No, the money didn't last that long unfortunately but yeah, so I guess they were sticking with  
**[0:07:42-0:07:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:42):**  us or we were all believing in us making the next step and luckily towards I think the  
**[0:07:49-0:07:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:49):**  end of 2020, yeah of course, I met a guy, Julius, from a company called Follow Food which  
**[0:07:56-0:08:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:07:56):**  is like one of the most sustainable food brands in Germany and they started this Follow Fish  
**[0:08:01-0:08:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:01):**  so you have basically traceable means of seeing where the food comes from and we met actually  
**[0:08:07-0:08:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:07):**  on the day where we got some more cows which was very exciting and he's just been the  
**[0:08:14-0:08:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:14):**  most incredible human.  
**[0:08:18-0:08:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:18):**  He said, look this is exactly what we're looking for, you're doing it, we want to  
**[0:08:22-0:08:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:22):**  support you and they didn't do this because they wanted an equity stake or they didn't  
**[0:08:26-0:08:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:26):**  do it because they want to brag about it, they just said, look we want to support stuff  
**[0:08:32-0:08:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:32):**  that you do and that's why we support you and he stepped up, if it wasn't for him we  
**[0:08:37-0:08:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:37):**  wouldn't be here right now, I wouldn't be talking to you and you know this and probably  
**[0:08:43-0:08:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:43):**  quite a few listeners who are trying to start something know this also, when you have an  
**[0:08:48-0:08:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:48):**  idea and you have a vision and you have some energy to put that to life, you'll meet hundreds  
**[0:08:54-0:08:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:54):**  of people that tell you how great they think you are and how great it is what you're doing  
**[0:08:58-0:09:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:08:58):**  and they're like, yeah I'm going to do this, I'm going to do that, but nothing's going  
**[0:09:01-0:09:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:01):**  to happen, right?  
**[0:09:02-0:09:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:02):**  If they have to sign a paycheck, suddenly it's all not that great anymore, right?  
**[0:09:07-0:09:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:07):**  And so there I have to say, if it wasn't for him in that moment, that was a huge step for  
**[0:09:12-0:09:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:12):**  us because that allowed us to actually continue, start to actually employ some of the interns  
**[0:09:17-0:09:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:17):**  that had believed to stay with us and that was sort of the first step and then shortly  
**[0:09:22-0:09:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:22):**  thereafter we actually won a prize with a brand called ECOVA, they do like sustainable  
**[0:09:28-0:09:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:28):**  washing soaps and this kind of stuff and they had been quite successful through Corona and  
**[0:09:33-0:09:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:33):**  said, okay we want to give this back to nature-based solutions and I couldn't sleep at one point  
**[0:09:38-0:09:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:38):**  and saw the advertisement and thought, why not apply?  
**[0:09:42-0:09:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:42):**  And then I totally forgot about it, I just wrote like something about holistic transformation  
**[0:09:46-0:09:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:46):**  of a forest because we're here in Eastern Brandenburg have like 74% pine monoculture,  
**[0:09:52-0:09:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:52):**  which is a ticking time bomb if you want, right?  
**[0:09:55-0:09:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:55):**  So you think it's forest, like when you hear these numbers of the forest cover in Europe  
**[0:09:59-0:10:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:09:59):**  has been growing, yeah there are trees, but if you drive through them and have been there,  
**[0:10:04-0:10:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:04):**  it's yeah, it's factory farm trees or it's like you say, biodiversity and life isn't  
**[0:10:09-0:10:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:09):**  really active in that place, to say the least.  
**[0:10:12-0:10:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:12):**  Yeah, it really is a ticking time bomb, like it's not able to withstand what's coming  
**[0:10:17-0:10:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:17):**  and this is a fact, right?  
**[0:10:18-0:10:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:18):**  But it's of such a great magnitude that people are not, like the politicians are not daring  
**[0:10:25-0:10:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:25):**  to say because we have this, I mean this is a different discussion, but we have the same  
**[0:10:29-0:10:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:29):**  problem in agriculture as we have in forestry, like we have things that we actually do and  
**[0:10:34-0:10:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:34):**  contribute with regards to climate or rural development activities which are not paid  
**[0:10:39-0:10:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:39):**  for which of course, that money would be used to transform what we have to do in order to  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:44):**  withstand, whatever, you know the drill.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:47):**  Just out of in terms of context, your farm or the farm you manage and hopefully will  
**[0:10:52-0:10:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:52):**  pass on to the next generations is 1000 hectare organic grain and now mixes and there are  
**[0:10:59-0:11:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:10:59):**  trees coming to that as well, but 2000 hectares of forest.  
**[0:11:02-0:11:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:02):**  So the forest piece is a big chunk of the farm, let's say.  
**[0:11:06-0:11:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:06):**  Yeah, for sure and potentially of course, also such a big part of the economic feasibility  
**[0:11:11-0:11:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:11):**  of an area like this, but for that to happen, you have to invest for a long time and transform  
**[0:11:17-0:11:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:17):**  the whole setup of the forest.  
**[0:11:19-0:11:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:19):**  So you decided to write this for this prize on the forestry part, on this tick time, because  
**[0:11:25-0:11:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:25):**  you were still half sleeping or because you thought let's not write about the farming  
**[0:11:29-0:11:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:29):**  part, you thought this is a perfect nature-based solution.  
**[0:11:31-0:11:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:31):**  What made you write that piece on that and not talk about, okay, I would like more animals  
**[0:11:36-0:11:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:36):**  and more electric fences?  
**[0:11:38-0:11:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:38):**  Well, to be honest with you, because at that point we already kind of knew in which sort  
**[0:11:43-0:11:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:43):**  of directions we want to go with regards to all the on-farm research and development as  
**[0:11:48-0:11:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:48):**  far as agroforestry and specifically centropic agroforestry is concerned.  
**[0:11:52-0:11:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:52):**  We already were planning and thinking and talking about silvopasture models and so I  
**[0:11:57-0:12:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:11:57):**  thought also something I learned in school.  
**[0:12:00-0:12:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:00):**  I always spend time trying to understand the exam and the teacher to know what kind of  
**[0:12:06-0:12:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:06):**  thing he's going to be asking for and in that sense also, I mean, I think there was five  
**[0:12:10-0:12:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:10):**  different areas where you could apply for agriculture or land use was one, but there  
**[0:12:14-0:12:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:14):**  was one forest one and I thought, nobody's going to do forest.  
**[0:12:16-0:12:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:16):**  The competition in the forest is going to be less big, so let's go for forest.  
**[0:12:22-0:12:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:22):**  That's probably what I went looking for the shortcut.  
**[0:12:25-0:12:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:25):**  But yeah, and at the same time, it is a huge problem for us and something that is just  
**[0:12:31-0:12:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:31):**  above my head waiting to fall down.  
**[0:12:33-0:12:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:33):**  So it is something that is also…  
**[0:12:35-0:12:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:35):**  You forgot about it and then you won.  
**[0:12:37-0:12:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:37):**  So you basically suddenly out of nowhere you got a phone call, you got an email, what happened  
**[0:12:41-0:12:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:41):**  there with that competition?  
**[0:12:43-0:12:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:43):**  Yeah, suddenly I got this email and like, congratulations, you were in the finalist  
**[0:12:47-0:12:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:47):**  round of XYZ and I was like, I couldn't really remember because it was like three  
**[0:12:51-0:12:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:51):**  to two months or whatever ago and the application to get into that space was just really, really  
**[0:12:57-0:12:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:57):**  short.  
**[0:12:58-0:13:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:12:58):**  I did it in like, I don't know, half an hour and then we were invited to actually  
**[0:13:02-0:13:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:02):**  do a proper casual statement and a proper description and then we actually went into  
**[0:13:06-0:13:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:06):**  the planning progress and then had a presentation in front of the jury and all that.  
**[0:13:13-0:13:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:13):**  And in the end, we were one of three projects that were selected out of 760 something, I  
**[0:13:20-0:13:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:20):**  think.  
**[0:13:21-0:13:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:21):**  And so that was another huge thing for us, which would basically enable us not only to  
**[0:13:27-0:13:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:27):**  get started on the whole planning and the process of bringing that project to life,  
**[0:13:31-0:13:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:31):**  but of course we as a team knew, okay, the story continues at least for a bit.  
**[0:13:38-0:13:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:38):**  And so that was basically then the next big step for us and now we're already in 2021  
**[0:13:44-0:13:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:44):**  and there was then pretty much, let's say the most, the last piece of the puzzle, so  
**[0:13:50-0:13:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:50):**  to say, to bring us on the stage where we wanted to be because we met people, incredible  
**[0:13:55-0:14:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:13:55):**  people again, that basically I was telling my story in the sense of, you know, I've  
**[0:14:01-0:14:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:01):**  done this before and then I took over the farm and I realized technology as we know  
**[0:14:04-0:14:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:04):**  it now is not the solution.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:07):**  We have to focus on ecosystem health, soil health, and then looking at different models  
**[0:14:11-0:14:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:11):**  all over the world and then deciding I want to bring them all to a place where it's just  
**[0:14:15-0:14:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:15):**  incredibly difficult to do agriculture or forestry in the first place, to then test  
**[0:14:19-0:14:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:19):**  and develop on our fields, to gather the data and develop software and technology in order  
**[0:14:24-0:14:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:24):**  to scale it on areas where we might add some value through this work.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:30):**  And I said, look, but this is the thing is that you can't get any grants for this.  
**[0:14:34-0:14:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:34):**  No one understands that innovation, system innovation, ecological innovation is just  
**[0:14:38-0:14:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:38):**  as important as technological innovation.  
**[0:14:40-0:14:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:40):**  And then those guys was like, interesting, because these are the kind of projects that  
**[0:14:44-0:14:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:44):**  we finance that don't get any other money.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:46):**  And I was like, no, really?  
**[0:14:48-0:14:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:48):**  Okay.  
**[0:14:49-0:14:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:49):**  But you must have heard that before as well.  
**[0:14:51-0:14:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:51):**  And in this case, they actually followed through.  
**[0:14:53-0:14:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:53):**  Like that's a...  
**[0:14:54-0:14:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:54):**  Exactly.  
**[0:14:55-0:14:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:55):**  I mean, yeah.  
**[0:14:56-0:15:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:14:56):**  I mean, if you ask me what's the most and maybe the most important thing looking back  
**[0:15:01-0:15:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:01):**  or the most unique experience, it's just about the people.  
**[0:15:05-0:15:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:05):**  Everyone's just chatting and everyone's just...  
**[0:15:09-0:15:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:09):**  It's always about the people.  
**[0:15:11-0:15:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:11):**  You need to find the right people.  
**[0:15:12-0:15:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:12):**  It doesn't really matter what's the topic.  
**[0:15:13-0:15:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:13):**  It's just the people, right?  
**[0:15:15-0:15:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:15):**  And this is for your team.  
**[0:15:17-0:15:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:17):**  This is for your supporters.  
**[0:15:18-0:15:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:18):**  This is for your partners.  
**[0:15:19-0:15:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:19):**  This is, you know, just have people, great people around you.  
**[0:15:23-0:15:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:23):**  Anyway, so yeah, and that then enabled us to actually found a foundation together with  
**[0:15:28-0:15:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:28):**  them that now we can actually use to do really the sort of professional scientific monitoring  
**[0:15:34-0:15:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:34):**  and analysis and data gathering and all of that, which actually then builds on having  
**[0:15:41-0:15:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:41):**  Syntropic Agroforestry Systems, different ones out on the field.  
**[0:15:45-0:15:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:45):**  Because the idea is always to not only gather the data as far as, you know, how is the process  
**[0:15:50-0:15:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:50):**  of actually, let's say, designing an agroforestry system and what are the investment costs and  
**[0:15:55-0:16:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:15:55):**  the harvest costs, as I say, or maintenance costs, but also what are the potential yield  
**[0:16:01-0:16:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:01):**  estimates, right?  
**[0:16:02-0:16:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:02):**  So how can I actually find an investable economic model?  
**[0:16:06-0:16:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:06):**  This is one part of the coin, but the other part of the coin is what does really happen  
**[0:16:11-0:16:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:11):**  with carbon beneath agroforestry systems?  
**[0:16:14-0:16:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:14):**  What does really happen with biodiversity?  
**[0:16:16-0:16:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:16):**  What does really happen with the wind speed, the soil temperature, and all these things  
**[0:16:19-0:16:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:19):**  that today we just talk about and we know they're relevant, but we don't include them  
**[0:16:23-0:16:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:23):**  in the discussion of systems.  
**[0:16:25-0:16:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:25):**  You know they change, but we don't know how much, which direction do they change as a  
**[0:16:30-0:16:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:30):**  benefit or not.  
**[0:16:31-0:16:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:31):**  And this is all research and development.  
**[0:16:34-0:16:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:34):**  And I think that we reached that conclusion at the end of this series as well.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:38):**  And I invite everybody obviously to listen to it.  
**[0:16:40-0:16:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:40):**  I will put the link in the show notes that we can talk all about transition finance models,  
**[0:16:45-0:16:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:45):**  but unless the business models of farmers improve, it's all empty talk.  
**[0:16:49-0:16:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:49):**  And so we really got, and we'll unpack that a bit further in this conversation as well.  
**[0:16:54-0:16:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:54):**  We need better off-take agreements.  
**[0:16:55-0:16:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:55):**  We need better contracts.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:16:56):**  But before we even talk about that, we need to actually have agriculture models that work  
**[0:17:01-0:17:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:01):**  with limited input, that work in the difficult context, that work in any context.  
**[0:17:05-0:17:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:05):**  And for any context, in this case it's Brandenburg, someone needs to figure out what is the model,  
**[0:17:09-0:17:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:09):**  what's the recipe.  
**[0:17:10-0:17:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:10):**  And when you're figuring that out, you need grand capital, unless you have very deep pockets  
**[0:17:13-0:17:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:13):**  yourself and then you're financing your own grand capital, but you need research and development  
**[0:17:17-0:17:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:17):**  and you need to be able to, because nobody will teach you how to do these models unless  
**[0:17:22-0:17:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:22):**  you have a very advanced few farmers around you that have been doing this for 30 years.  
**[0:17:27-0:17:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:27):**  If you're one of the first, you're going to pay the research and development costs.  
**[0:17:31-0:17:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:31):**  And a few grand euros and dollars can go a very, very, very long way, but it is grand  
**[0:17:36-0:17:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:36):**  capital.  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:37):**  I mean, it might come back in some ecosystem services somewhere in the future, but you  
**[0:17:41-0:17:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:41):**  need to figure out what syntropic agroforestry model works for you.  
**[0:17:45-0:17:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:45):**  What is the integration of animals in this specific context, et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:17:49-0:17:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:49):**  People often forget, like, oh, let's finance all of it.  
**[0:17:51-0:17:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:51):**  I mean, this is a podcast talking about investing, but before we can invest, there's a lot of,  
**[0:17:55-0:17:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:55):**  I mean, if you look at the rocket space, the electric car space, if you look at the electronic  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:17:59):**  space we're using to record this, it's all been financed by research and development,  
**[0:18:04-0:18:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:04):**  partly private, partly public.  
**[0:18:05-0:18:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:05):**  So let's not step over that fundamental piece of grand capital there or research and development  
**[0:18:11-0:18:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:11):**  very patient capital that can help enable people like you to find the recipes at work.  
**[0:18:16-0:18:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:16):**  And then we can talk about scale and financing it and all of that.  
**[0:18:20-0:18:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:20):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:21-0:18:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:21):**  I mean, I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:18:23-0:18:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:23):**  It's so beautiful to see all the attention that agriculture now gets and of course, specifically  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:29):**  regenerative agriculture gets, but like, I think we put a lot of pressure on the farmers  
**[0:18:34-0:18:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:34):**  that are in really different situations to what we believe regenerative agriculture can  
**[0:18:38-0:18:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:38):**  be as a key and solution to everything.  
**[0:18:41-0:18:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:41):**  And I truly believe that it of course can be, but we can't forget that most farmers  
**[0:18:46-0:18:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:46):**  are stuck in a system.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:47):**  They have been forced, not forced, but they have been-  
**[0:18:51-0:18:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:51):**  Natched.  
**[0:18:52-0:18:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:52):**  Asked to produce as much as they can for the cheapest price for many, many years.  
**[0:18:59-0:19:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:18:59):**  And this system has been supported by billions and billions and billions.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:04):**  And now we turn to the farmers to say, oh, by the way, can you maybe do a bit more for  
**[0:19:07-0:19:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:07):**  animal husbandry?  
**[0:19:08-0:19:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:08):**  And why not do a bit more biodiversity?  
**[0:19:11-0:19:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:11):**  And you're like, sorry, what?  
**[0:19:13-0:19:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:13):**  And then I was like, okay, well, let's invest in regenerative agriculture.  
**[0:19:16-0:19:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:16):**  Well, before we invest in anything, we need proven business models.  
**[0:19:20-0:19:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:20):**  We need calculation and data that we can actually use to assess if it makes worth to do X, Y,  
**[0:19:25-0:19:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:25):**  Z in a regenerative sense.  
**[0:19:27-0:19:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:27):**  And there's so much work that still needs to be done and data still needs to be gathered  
**[0:19:32-0:19:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:32):**  and also technology and software that needs to be changed.  
**[0:19:34-0:19:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:34):**  And specifically, we have to look towards politics and companies and all of those big  
**[0:19:40-0:19:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:40):**  decisions that are not down at the farmer's level, but in the European gap and so forth.  
**[0:19:47-0:19:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:47):**  And it's always easy to say, oh, let the farmers do it.  
**[0:19:50-0:19:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:50):**  No, it doesn't work like that.  
**[0:19:52-0:19:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:52):**  Let's change some of the really big questions that we hardly ever talk about in that sense.  
**[0:19:57-0:20:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:19:57):**  Scientific community, education, access to land, access to finance, all these things.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:01):**  You of course talk about a lot, but I don't as much.  
**[0:20:05-0:20:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:05):**  We're niche in a niche.  
**[0:20:07-0:20:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:07):**  And so let's unpack a few of those.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:09):**  In terms of the conclusion we reached at that point, in terms of offtake agreements, how  
**[0:20:13-0:20:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:13):**  has that changed over the last year and a half?  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:16):**  Has that changed?  
**[0:20:17-0:20:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:17):**  First of all, let's ask the question, are you still in the organic commodity market?  
**[0:20:24-0:20:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:24):**  Is that something you're working on?  
**[0:20:25-0:20:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:25):**  What's been there?  
**[0:20:26-0:20:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:26):**  I mean, are we going to see your face on a package anytime soon of flour and milk with  
**[0:20:31-0:20:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:31):**  your grain, like your smiley face with your hipster face with your hat?  
**[0:20:35-0:20:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:35):**  What's the progress there?  
**[0:20:36-0:20:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:36):**  Well, I have to disappoint you with that.  
**[0:20:40-0:20:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:40):**  But yeah, I mean, we have been working on that and we have been trying to see what is  
**[0:20:44-0:20:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:44):**  possible, but it's, you know, the world is not waiting for you in a sense.  
**[0:20:50-0:20:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:50):**  Like there has to be, you know, you have to have a really good strategy.  
**[0:20:54-0:20:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:54):**  You have to have a good idea.  
**[0:20:56-0:21:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:20:56):**  But I mean, the main product that we are currently producing is grain and flour, for example,  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:01):**  is not for most a product that is specifically sexy with regards to, I don't know, an old  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:07):**  wine from a certain age that, you know, X, Y, Z.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:10):**  Like of course you can go into that and take it for that quality and tell that story.  
**[0:21:16-0:21:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:16):**  And you have a special stone mill and you have, you know, the starch breaking down in  
**[0:21:21-0:21:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:21):**  a different sense and then it's beautiful and tasty and all that, for sure.  
**[0:21:25-0:21:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:25):**  But communicate that on a package where someone takes maybe one or two seconds to look at  
**[0:21:31-0:21:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:31):**  and they also going to look at the price like 100%.  
**[0:21:36-0:21:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:36):**  So it's a tough product.  
**[0:21:38-0:21:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:38):**  It's an incredible product.  
**[0:21:39-0:21:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:39):**  I think it has an insane potential also because it's as a staple, it can carry that message  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:46):**  so beautifully.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:47):**  So it's definitely something I'm still figuring out, thinking about, talking about and seeing  
**[0:21:54-0:21:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:54):**  where we can go with it.  
**[0:21:55-0:21:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:55):**  But it's not something that you just do and then it works.  
**[0:21:59-0:22:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:21:59):**  Create a brand.  
**[0:22:00-0:22:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:00):**  No, no.  
**[0:22:01-0:22:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:01):**  I don't think it will be out now, but at some point we'll be interviewing Wildfarmed, which  
**[0:22:05-0:22:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:05):**  is an interesting, Wildfarming, two different companies in the UK working a lot on flour  
**[0:22:10-0:22:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:10):**  and direct seeding and integration of animals.  
**[0:22:13-0:22:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:13):**  And they have built that connection to the bakeries, et cetera.  
**[0:22:17-0:22:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:17):**  So there's that pool because without that, yeah, you're going to be just the next package  
**[0:22:20-0:22:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:20):**  on the shelf and probably very expensive compared to, but actually the right price, but very  
**[0:22:25-0:22:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:25):**  expensive compared to the others.  
**[0:22:27-0:22:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:27):**  And that's just not going to fly.  
**[0:22:29-0:22:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:29):**  And the amount of time it takes to create a brand is something that will happen, but  
**[0:22:33-0:22:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:33):**  maybe not now.  
**[0:22:34-0:22:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:34):**  So let's talk about on the farm, what has happened.  
**[0:22:36-0:22:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:36):**  There were some animals on the farm, there were definitely some cows, there were some  
**[0:22:39-0:22:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:39):**  chickens during the series, I think we recorded.  
**[0:22:42-0:22:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:42):**  But if you had to give an overview now of the different experiments or what's the craziest  
**[0:22:46-0:22:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:46):**  experiment that's been going on for the last year and a half, if you had to pick one.  
**[0:22:51-0:22:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:51):**  Yeah, so I mean, as far as the team is concerned, you know, we have now grown to a solid team  
**[0:22:57-0:23:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:22:57):**  of well, all together throughout the different companies, we have more than 25 full time  
**[0:23:03-0:23:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:03):**  employees.  
**[0:23:04-0:23:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:04):**  And we have an average between five and 15 interns basically.  
**[0:23:09-0:23:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:09):**  And then on special, let's say planting occasions, a lot of people, which is great, because you're  
**[0:23:14-0:23:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:14):**  quite remote and having energy around you, I think for many farmers is what keeps them  
**[0:23:19-0:23:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:19):**  going.  
**[0:23:20-0:23:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:20):**  And I think that's the case in your case as well.  
**[0:23:21-0:23:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:21):**  Yeah, I mean, 100%.  
**[0:23:22-0:23:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:22):**  You know, I think this is what where I take so much power and energy from is to see like  
**[0:23:27-0:23:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:27):**  the people that come here and you know, they are just, they're just incredible people.  
**[0:23:31-0:23:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:31):**  They are gifted, they are smart, they are hardworking, you know, they have their their  
**[0:23:36-0:23:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:36):**  hearts at the right spot.  
**[0:23:38-0:23:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:38):**  And you know, they believe in what we do.  
**[0:23:40-0:23:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:40):**  And they believe that also, there's hope, you know, like, I think that is something  
**[0:23:44-0:23:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:44):**  that is so crucial, like, what is just so hopeful is that these people that come here,  
**[0:23:48-0:23:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:48):**  you know, they could earn three times, two times, four times what you can pay as a farmer.  
**[0:23:53-0:23:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:53):**  But what they have realized is that agriculture is simply put, like the biggest instrument  
**[0:23:59-0:24:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:23:59):**  to overcome some of the biggest problems of our time.  
**[0:24:01-0:24:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:01):**  You know, it's not just primary production, it's health, it's climate adaptation, of  
**[0:24:06-0:24:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:06):**  course, it's biodiversity, it's development of rural areas, it's culture, it's education,  
**[0:24:12-0:24:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:12):**  it's all of it, right.  
**[0:24:13-0:24:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:13):**  And that's what we need to understand globally, and it has to start politicians, but it goes  
**[0:24:19-0:24:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:19):**  beyond that, of course.  
**[0:24:20-0:24:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:20):**  Because if we understand that this is what agriculture is, we of course, would look at  
**[0:24:24-0:24:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:24):**  it differently, we would see it differently, we would finance it differently, the scientific  
**[0:24:27-0:24:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:27):**  community would go into different direction, the focus on machines and technology and software  
**[0:24:31-0:24:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:31):**  would go into a different direction.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:33):**  But it's not yet happening.  
**[0:24:34-0:24:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:34):**  But you know, this is really what has to come across.  
**[0:24:37-0:24:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:37):**  So I mean, our team now, we have two people, Hosea and Renke that are heading our agroforestry  
**[0:24:42-0:24:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:42):**  system, our agroforestry team, Jojo's who's heading the tree nursery, Lawrence who's  
**[0:24:48-0:24:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:48):**  doing the compost, Berger who's doing the holistic grazing, Max who's in charge of  
**[0:24:53-0:25:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:24:53):**  the whole scientific data gathering, Lea with, I mean, the list just goes on, you know, and  
**[0:25:00-0:25:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:00):**  we are just incredibly lucky to have these most incredible people that, yeah.  
**[0:25:05-0:25:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:05):**  Show it out.  
**[0:25:06-0:25:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:06):**  I'm just really, yeah, I'm just emotionally touched by being here in this space and having  
**[0:25:12-0:25:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:12):**  them with us, around us.  
**[0:25:15-0:25:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:15):**  And also us as a team with people that have been here for many years, from the agriculture,  
**[0:25:20-0:25:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:20):**  from the forestry or in the office, now starting to grow together so much more and having more  
**[0:25:25-0:25:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:25):**  time to actually speak about that shared vision and that shared idea yet being so differently.  
**[0:25:30-0:25:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:30):**  How's it going?  
**[0:25:31-0:25:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:31):**  That integration of the old squad basically that has been there for many, because you  
**[0:25:36-0:25:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:36):**  as a large farming company, also before you started on the whole regenerative journey,  
**[0:25:41-0:25:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:41):**  obviously you employed a lot of people, I think over 20.  
**[0:25:44-0:25:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:44):**  And then you come bring this young bunch in because the people you just mentioned are  
**[0:25:49-0:25:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:49):**  not over 40, let's say, and they come with all these crazy ideas about integration of  
**[0:25:52-0:25:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:52):**  trees and animals and life and mycorrhiza and compost and et cetera, et cetera.  
**[0:25:57-0:26:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:25:57):**  How is that integration or has it happened?  
**[0:26:00-0:26:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:00):**  Like how is that symbiotic relationship going and is that really tough?  
**[0:26:04-0:26:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:04):**  Because it's a thing that many people see.  
**[0:26:06-0:26:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:06):**  I mean, it's nice to come in with new energy, but it can also hit a wall because you might  
**[0:26:10-0:26:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:10):**  have come in with too much energy and are trying to disturb systems that have been going  
**[0:26:16-0:26:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:16):**  the same direction for a long time.  
**[0:26:18-0:26:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:18):**  Is that a worry?  
**[0:26:19-0:26:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:19):**  Is that going well?  
**[0:26:20-0:26:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:20):**  What's your experience there of these two, almost two different worlds?  
**[0:26:23-0:26:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:23):**  That's a really good question.  
**[0:26:24-0:26:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:24):**  And it's one that I haven't figured out particularly well for quite a few years, but now really  
**[0:26:29-0:26:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:29):**  working on it, this is really my focus now.  
**[0:26:32-0:26:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:32):**  And to be honest with you, I think what makes us as a group here in Madlitz strong is that  
**[0:26:39-0:26:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:39):**  we are exactly what you described, so diverse.  
**[0:26:42-0:26:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:42):**  We have people with different experiences, different backgrounds, different visions and  
**[0:26:45-0:26:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:45):**  philosophies and that is really so crucial for the work that we do.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:50):**  Because I mean, what we are essentially focusing on is to gather data and information and wanting  
**[0:26:57-0:27:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:26:57):**  to find ways that we can then scale regenerative agriculture models and instruments on huge  
**[0:27:04-0:27:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:04):**  areas, not only in ours, but make that data accessible to other people.  
**[0:27:09-0:27:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:09):**  And in that process, it's important to not drift off in your little eco warrior bubble,  
**[0:27:17-0:27:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:17):**  but you have to be on the ground.  
**[0:27:18-0:27:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:18):**  You have to understand the worries and the stuff that goes through farmers' heads.  
**[0:27:23-0:27:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:23):**  You have to understand why they might emotionally have a problem with one of the things that  
**[0:27:27-0:27:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:27):**  you're trying to do.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:28):**  You just need to be there.  
**[0:27:31-0:27:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:31):**  And having that group that is so diverse and having that tension sometimes and the discussion  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:37):**  sometimes about certain things and ways and philosophies is what keeps you being aware  
**[0:27:42-0:27:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:42):**  and on the ground.  
**[0:27:44-0:27:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:44):**  So I think that is really, really making us very strong.  
**[0:27:47-0:27:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:47):**  And it's also beautiful because if you manage to put that together in a room and if you  
**[0:27:52-0:27:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:52):**  manage to establish communication lines where they can actually share and also respect themselves  
**[0:27:58-0:28:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:27:58):**  or each other, good things come from that.  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:00):**  That's how creativity is happening, I guess.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:03):**  And for me, I think there's many ways to bake a cake.  
**[0:28:08-0:28:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:08):**  For me personally, we were struggling with the companies for a good few years, and it  
**[0:28:16-0:28:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:16):**  was not a nice time for me.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:18):**  It was really, really tough.  
**[0:28:20-0:28:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:20):**  And we started with all, let's say, the first regenerative ideas and things that we did  
**[0:28:26-0:28:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:26):**  outside.  
**[0:28:27-0:28:31](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:27):**  And back in the day, of course, we didn't have much to show for, right?  
**[0:28:31-0:28:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:31):**  It kind of grew and started to grow.  
**[0:28:33-0:28:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:33):**  And then suddenly there's some interns and some people also there.  
**[0:28:37-0:28:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:37):**  And then of course, it's difficult and different in the beginning.  
**[0:28:41-0:28:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:41):**  But we have, of course, come quite a far way and now can actually show a lot out there.  
**[0:28:48-0:28:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:48):**  And so having gone through all of that and having actually established now, let's say,  
**[0:28:54-0:28:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:54):**  an organization set up that allows us to look to the future and to actually build on that,  
**[0:28:59-0:29:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:28:59):**  which we weren't able to at all in the last four years, now was the time for me actually  
**[0:29:04-0:29:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:04):**  to say, okay, now is the time where I bring them together and we focus more on communication  
**[0:29:09-0:29:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:09):**  and we focus more on certain ways that we want to do and be with each other and live  
**[0:29:15-0:29:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:15):**  and learn from each other, which before that I just had no time to.  
**[0:29:21-0:29:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:21):**  It's my fault in the end of the day, the fish starts smelling at the head.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:25):**  I don't know how you say that saying in English.  
**[0:29:28-0:29:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:28):**  But no idea, but it sounds good.  
**[0:29:32-0:29:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:32):**  It's not easy for sure.  
**[0:29:34-0:29:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:34):**  And it's a process.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:35):**  And you're not ever going to make everyone happy at the same time.  
**[0:29:39-0:29:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:39):**  That's not how people are.  
**[0:29:41-0:29:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:41):**  There's going to be people who are annoyed.  
**[0:29:43-0:29:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:43):**  There's going to be things that don't go well.  
**[0:29:45-0:29:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:45):**  And that's part of life.  
**[0:29:48-0:29:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:48):**  And we are trying to transform 3,000 hectares of agriculture and forestry.  
**[0:29:53-0:30:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:29:53):**  Anyone who thinks that that process is beautiful, that within that transformation phase, all  
**[0:30:01-0:30:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:01):**  the communication is going well and everything is going well and everything is always clean,  
**[0:30:06-0:30:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:06):**  no, it's not going to happen.  
**[0:30:08-0:30:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:08):**  A startup who is in a certain phase is not going to have perfect processes also.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:13):**  It's part of what we have to do.  
**[0:30:15-0:30:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:15):**  This is why it is also hard.  
**[0:30:17-0:30:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:17):**  It's very messy.  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:18):**  And that has to fit.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:19):**  That has to fit.  
**[0:30:20-0:30:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:20):**  And for sure it doesn't fit for everyone.  
**[0:30:22-0:30:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:22):**  And that's OK.  
**[0:30:23-0:30:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:23):**  There's no hard feelings there.  
**[0:30:26-0:30:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:26):**  So let's talk a bit about what's happening on the ground, in the ground, above the ground.  
**[0:30:29-0:30:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:29):**  I saw some crazy pictures on Instagram of a lot of fallen trees or cut trees.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:35):**  What's been happening there in the forest?  
**[0:30:36-0:30:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:36):**  Did you get a very specific, very concentrated wind blow going around?  
**[0:30:40-0:30:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:40):**  I have to say, I was there yesterday or two days before and I haven't been there for a  
**[0:30:44-0:30:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:44):**  week or one and a half weeks.  
**[0:30:46-0:30:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:46):**  And I'm just in awe what they've again pulled out of the pocket.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:51):**  So actually, this is the forest transformation project that I was referring to earlier from  
**[0:30:56-0:31:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:30:56):**  eCOVA, where we basically have identified five different plots of between one and a  
**[0:31:02-0:31:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:02):**  half and 2.1 hectares each within a very homogeneous pine monoculture forest that we own.  
**[0:31:12-0:31:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:12):**  And those five we have then designed in different transformation styles.  
**[0:31:17-0:31:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:17):**  So one is basically just like the zero plot.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:19):**  So we just put a fence around it, don't do anything just to see what would happen if  
**[0:31:23-0:31:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:23):**  we don't do anything, basically.  
**[0:31:25-0:31:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:25):**  And then all the other plots are starting from quite easily scalable because it's not  
**[0:31:30-0:31:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:30):**  very difficult to do.  
**[0:31:32-0:31:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:32):**  It's quite cheap to do, like the transformation cutting down some trees, let's say, to become  
**[0:31:37-0:31:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:37):**  more and more specialised, more and more diversity, more and more labour intensive to then actually  
**[0:31:43-0:31:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:43):**  end in the last and the most incredible transformation plot where we bring in all the knowledge of  
**[0:31:50-0:31:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:50):**  centropic agriculture into forest transformation.  
**[0:31:52-0:31:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:52):**  So Renke, our head of agroforestry, works very closely with Ernst Gutsch in this project,  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:58):**  for example.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:31:59):**  They've been in contact back and forth, like how we should transform it, what should we  
**[0:32:02-0:32:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:02):**  do and which seeds and which trees and grass and this and that.  
**[0:32:06-0:32:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:06):**  So that's really what those pictures that you saw where we have like this plot.  
**[0:32:11-0:32:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:11):**  Just describe it visually.  
**[0:32:12-0:32:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:12):**  I will put photos if I can find them on Instagram.  
**[0:32:15-0:32:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:15):**  But if not, just visually take us on how does that most extreme plot look like now and how  
**[0:32:22-0:32:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:22):**  would it potentially look like in the future?  
**[0:32:24-0:32:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:24):**  But make it visual because we are on audio.  
**[0:32:27-0:32:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:27):**  You're much more gifted in this than I do.  
**[0:32:29-0:32:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:29):**  But basically, if you think of the pine monoculture, right, you just see it's actually kind of  
**[0:32:36-0:32:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:36):**  beautiful in a weird, disgusting sense.  
**[0:32:38-0:32:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:38):**  But you just have flat soil and you have all the trees which are just like really, really  
**[0:32:43-0:32:44](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:43):**  straight.  
**[0:32:44-0:32:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:44):**  And the canopy at the beginning, at the top, is touching each other.  
**[0:32:48-0:32:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:48):**  So basically, it's kind of dark underneath.  
**[0:32:50-0:32:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:50):**  And so you see down the tree lines for miles, like you can see so far down there, right?  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:55):**  Because they're all straight.  
**[0:32:56-0:32:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:56):**  They're all planted.  
**[0:32:57-0:32:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:57):**  They look the same time.  
**[0:32:58-0:33:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:32:58):**  They're all planted in the same rows.  
**[0:33:00-0:33:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:00):**  And there's nothing underneath, obviously growing.  
**[0:33:03-0:33:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:03):**  And everyone is unique, but they all look the same, if you know what I mean.  
**[0:33:07-0:33:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:07):**  Anyway, so within that monoculture tree structure, we just go in and take out like a square,  
**[0:33:11-0:33:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:11):**  so to say, or identify a square.  
**[0:33:13-0:33:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:13):**  And within the centropic transformation of that pine monoculture, we take out a third  
**[0:33:19-0:33:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:19):**  100% of the trees.  
**[0:33:21-0:33:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:21):**  So we take them all down.  
**[0:33:23-0:33:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:23):**  There's only one birch tree still standing there.  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:26):**  And from those trees that have been taken down there, actually around 40% we take out  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:32):**  of the forest and will sell.  
**[0:33:34-0:33:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:34):**  But 60% of the trees that we took down have then been aligned, basically in lines, left  
**[0:33:41-0:33:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:41):**  and right, of prepared seed beds.  
**[0:33:46-0:33:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:46):**  And the seed beds then have either a very diverse mix of different trees and shrubs  
**[0:33:52-0:34:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:33:52):**  and bushes and a few other things planted in there, or also, of course, proper trees  
**[0:34:00-0:34:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:00):**  and shrubs, which are not only seeds, but also actually visible as such.  
**[0:34:05-0:34:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:05):**  And so in that, let's say reorganization model, we basically then plant through seeds  
**[0:34:11-0:34:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:11):**  and trees an incredibly diverse mix of forest.  
**[0:34:16-0:34:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:16):**  And all of that is basically prepared by mulching the trees next to those seed beds.  
**[0:34:23-0:34:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:23):**  So if you stand in there, you just see basically no tree around.  
**[0:34:28-0:34:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:28):**  And you have these weird lines where you have really big tree chunks lining up left and  
**[0:34:32-0:34:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:32):**  right, left and right.  
**[0:34:34-0:34:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:34):**  So it's really incredible because your eye has never seen something like that.  
**[0:34:37-0:34:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:37):**  So if you stand in there, you're really irritated in a sense.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:39):**  But then if you have Henke telling you exactly what's happening where your mind is just blown  
**[0:34:46-0:34:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:46):**  off because there's just so much thought he put in it.  
**[0:34:49-0:34:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:49):**  And Ernst, of course, is from another planet when it comes to designing those kind of ecosystems,  
**[0:34:54-0:34:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:54):**  right?  
**[0:34:55-0:35:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:34:55):**  And then from there, if you turn around 108 degrees, you still have some tree structure,  
**[0:35:02-0:35:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:02):**  but where we only took out 60% of the trees.  
**[0:35:05-0:35:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:05):**  So you still have some trees there and the canopy is still there, but it's much more  
**[0:35:08-0:35:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:08):**  lighter.  
**[0:35:09-0:35:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:09):**  And underneath the same thing, you also got those rows which have been prepared with this  
**[0:35:15-0:35:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:15):**  preparation tool and then seeded and mulched again left and right.  
**[0:35:19-0:35:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:19):**  So it's just insane what work went in there.  
**[0:35:24-0:35:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:24):**  And the next years are going to be so interesting because we have all of these projects are  
**[0:35:29-0:35:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:29):**  scientifically monitored and really strongly analyzed through different senses, of course,  
**[0:35:37-0:35:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:37):**  as far as the soil.  
**[0:35:39-0:35:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:39):**  The soil is concerned, of course, the soil biology, but even more sort of water relevant  
**[0:35:45-0:35:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:45):**  topics, the whole biodiversity side of it, the economic analysis of it.  
**[0:35:50-0:35:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:50):**  So it's really an outrageous project and we're just very much looking forward to see it in  
**[0:35:56-0:35:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:56):**  a few years because of course it will change over time.  
**[0:35:59-0:36:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:35:59):**  And there's so much valuable info that we need actually to assess forest transformation  
**[0:36:04-0:36:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:04):**  techniques and also put a price tag to values that forests can take with regards to biodiversity,  
**[0:36:11-0:36:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:11):**  with regards to cooling effects, with regards to water storage and carbon storage and all  
**[0:36:16-0:36:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:16):**  these things.  
**[0:36:17-0:36:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:17):**  Today we talk about it a lot, but we can't really put a price tag on it.  
**[0:36:21-0:36:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:21):**  So that's part of what we're doing.  
**[0:36:22-0:36:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:22):**  And then on the agriculture side, we have established a few more systems.  
**[0:36:28-0:36:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:28):**  We've actually started in 2021 with our own sort of syntropic tree nursery where Jojo has  
**[0:36:35-0:36:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:35):**  basically from scratch built the most amazing, beautifully shaped tree nursery where we've  
**[0:36:41-0:36:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:41):**  done roughly nearly 2000 different fruit trees, specifically like apple and pear and plum  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:50):**  and those trees that he started to develop.  
**[0:36:54-0:37:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:36:54):**  In the beginning of last year, we've actually planted in our first key line syntropic agroforestry  
**[0:37:00-0:37:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:00):**  system towards the end of last year.  
**[0:37:03-0:37:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:03):**  So we have now a beautiful key line system that's on roughly 3.5 hectares.  
**[0:37:08-0:37:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:08):**  We have planted a large silver pastoral syntropic agroforestry systems on six hectares where  
**[0:37:14-0:37:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:14):**  we only have five meters between row and row.  
**[0:37:17-0:37:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:17):**  We've done a very interesting syntropic seed agroforestry system where we actually just  
**[0:37:22-0:37:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:22):**  plant the underlying growth parts of the fruit trees that later we will put together with  
**[0:37:29-0:37:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:29):**  the fruit variety.  
**[0:37:30-0:37:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:30):**  So that is very, very interesting with regards to having a system that is really, really  
**[0:37:35-0:37:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:35):**  location and climate adapted because it kind of grows here from the very start.  
**[0:37:41-0:37:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:41):**  That's really interesting.  
**[0:37:42-0:37:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:42):**  Our whole composting facility is just going wild, Lawrence.  
**[0:37:49-0:37:56](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:49):**  I remember visiting in October and Lawrence was saying you were doing some trials around  
**[0:37:56-0:38:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:37:56):**  seed coating and the grain seeds that just went in the winter grain, if I'm correct,  
**[0:38:01-0:38:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:01):**  with a fermented compost extract, if I'm correct.  
**[0:38:05-0:38:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:05):**  The effect that you saw in a couple of weeks, I don't know if it carried through through  
**[0:38:09-0:38:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:09):**  the winter, was already, of course, there was to be scientifically backed up.  
**[0:38:12-0:38:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:12):**  But the visual effect in terms of root growth, like three weeks after you coated the seeds  
**[0:38:17-0:38:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:17):**  was stunning.  
**[0:38:18-0:38:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:18):**  And of course, you have to see how it harvests, how it's, etc., etc.  
**[0:38:22-0:38:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:22):**  But just for the dummy, like me, seeing that root growth, that difference in three weeks  
**[0:38:27-0:38:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:27):**  between the control piece of grain and the plot that was, or most of the other that was  
**[0:38:32-0:38:37](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:32):**  coated with this crazy fermented compost extract was just stunning to see the potential there.  
**[0:38:37-0:38:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:37):**  This was just the first year.  
**[0:38:38-0:38:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:38):**  And I'm imagining the amount of experimentation there is just going to go through the roof.  
**[0:38:43-0:38:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:43):**  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.  
**[0:38:45-0:38:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:45):**  The whole, I think as far as the compost is concerned, it's so obvious that, you know,  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:51):**  with every day and every thing you learn, or you try, or maybe even understand a bit  
**[0:38:57-0:39:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:38:57):**  more, you realize that you don't know anything.  
**[0:39:01-0:39:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:01):**  Like you are just in a universe of knowing nothing, basically, right?  
**[0:39:06-0:39:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:06):**  And that is really the beauty of it.  
**[0:39:08-0:39:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:08):**  Because like, there is just, you know, we're just scraping the surface of what's possible,  
**[0:39:13-0:39:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:13):**  right?  
**[0:39:14-0:39:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:14):**  And I am 100% convinced that we don't need anything as a farmer.  
**[0:39:21-0:39:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:21):**  We just need to understand much more of the complexity of the ecosystem and the interdependencies  
**[0:39:27-0:39:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:27):**  of different components in ecosystems and all the potential that we can gather through  
**[0:39:32-0:39:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:32):**  all the old knowledge that we already had.  
**[0:39:34-0:39:36](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:34):**  I mean, it was all there.  
**[0:39:36-0:39:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:36):**  And I think if we come back to that, you know, I think that's really one of the biggest,  
**[0:39:41-0:39:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:41):**  yeah, steps for us to become independent farmers again.  
**[0:39:45-0:39:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:45):**  And you know, everything today out there makes us dependent.  
**[0:39:48-0:39:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:48):**  And like, that's the worst that can happen.  
**[0:39:50-0:39:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:50):**  Like, it's really the worst that can happen is more dependent farmers.  
**[0:39:54-0:40:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:39:54):**  And also to see Lawrence who started as an intern, you know, he is an auto-detective  
**[0:40:01-0:40:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:01):**  compost expert now.  
**[0:40:03-0:40:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:03):**  I don't think there's many that he's like a sponge, you know, like a sponge from microbes  
**[0:40:08-0:40:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:08):**  and fungi.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:09):**  I would argue there are not many at that level in Europe.  
**[0:40:13-0:40:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:13):**  Of course, I'm going to get emails about this.  
**[0:40:14-0:40:16](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:14):**  I mean, I don't know anything.  
**[0:40:16-0:40:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:16):**  So I can easily say that, right?  
**[0:40:18-0:40:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:18):**  I don't know anything either.  
**[0:40:19-0:40:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:19):**  But it seems like, I mean, there are not many that are able to absorb and play between brackets,  
**[0:40:24-0:40:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:24):**  but play in the best sense of word at this scale.  
**[0:40:27-0:40:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:27):**  And that combination plus, of course, the rest of the team makes a very powerful combination.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:32):**  Like this is not, I'm doing a few plots here and that's it.  
**[0:40:35-0:40:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:35):**  I'm actually able to, in all of these, to take it to a scale that hardly anybody in  
**[0:40:40-0:40:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:40):**  Europe can simply because of the context.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:42):**  And in this case, you can, you will, and you have to as well.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:46):**  And so it's very, and to finalize, are you organizing, I mean, I would say to people,  
**[0:40:51-0:40:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:51):**  go and visit farms.  
**[0:40:52-0:40:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:52):**  Are there tours coming up this year?  
**[0:40:54-0:40:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:54):**  Can people go and come and experience in a structured way?  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:57):**  Don't always just show up at Benedict's.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:40:59):**  He's very busy, but are there going to be structured ways for people to experience these,  
**[0:41:04-0:41:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:04):**  the composting, the animals, the centropic fields, the crazy forest experiments, et cetera?  
**[0:41:09-0:41:12](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:09):**  Well, I mean, let's say we're working on it.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:12):**  I mean, we, of course we do have like farm tours and people that come and come and visit,  
**[0:41:17-0:41:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:17):**  which hasn't always been easy through Corona and so forth.  
**[0:41:21-0:41:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:21):**  And that's something definitely that we want to do more because it's just also really beautiful  
**[0:41:26-0:41:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:26):**  to see people react to this kind of stuff.  
**[0:41:29-0:41:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:29):**  Because you know, you hear so much shit out there and everything's going bad and like,  
**[0:41:34-0:41:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:34):**  climate change and, you know, there's just not many good news out there.  
**[0:41:38-0:41:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:38):**  But so I think people are really longing for some hope and they're longing for just to  
**[0:41:43-0:41:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:43):**  see some, I don't know, a place where there's just people who are really happy and most  
**[0:41:50-0:41:54](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:50):**  of the time, I guess, but who are just doing something because they really love it and  
**[0:41:54-0:41:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:54):**  they do it because it has an insane potential.  
**[0:41:57-0:42:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:41:57):**  And that's the spirit I think that you can also experience here.  
**[0:42:00-0:42:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:00):**  So I love doing it.  
**[0:42:02-0:42:06](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:02):**  You know, if I have people coming around and sometimes on the weekend, I'm like, okay,  
**[0:42:06-0:42:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:06):**  let's go and we jump on the mule and drive around.  
**[0:42:10-0:42:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:10):**  So you know, it's with all the shit that you also have doing it, this is some of the upside  
**[0:42:15-0:42:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:15):**  that you have that people are just really happy to see it.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:22](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:18):**  And that's some form of payback, but yet, of course, it gets more and more and then  
**[0:42:22-0:42:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:22):**  it becomes more difficult to manage that.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:25):**  So actually, we are in the process of thinking how can we find a certain, as you said, like  
**[0:42:30-0:42:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:30):**  structured way of doing it, but we're definitely working on it.  
**[0:42:34-0:42:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:34):**  And the last question on I always say last question and never is on the scientific side,  
**[0:42:38-0:42:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:38):**  like the data collection.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:40):**  How has that changed?  
**[0:42:41-0:42:42](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:41):**  I mean, it changed dramatically.  
**[0:42:42-0:42:47](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:42):**  You mentioned it a few times, but just for people to understand that this is a giant  
**[0:42:47-0:42:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:47):**  experiment or many experiments, but actually being followed quite closely by many people  
**[0:42:51-0:42:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:51):**  and over the next years even more.  
**[0:42:53-0:42:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:53):**  What's been happening on the data collection side with all these experiments you're running  
**[0:42:57-0:42:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:57):**  basically on the cloud?  
**[0:42:58-0:43:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:42:58):**  I think what's really incredible also to see is like the interest in the scientific community.  
**[0:43:05-0:43:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:05):**  When I started really like, I don't know, 2018, 2019, I asked around, of course, and  
**[0:43:10-0:43:13](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:10):**  I wrote like grant proposals and stuff like that.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:17](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:13):**  And no one ever was interested like they were just like, no, okay, well, yeah, you can pay  
**[0:43:17-0:43:19](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:17):**  for it, not really.  
**[0:43:19-0:43:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:19):**  And now the same kind of institutes and organizations and universities are like, oh, wow, you're  
**[0:43:24-0:43:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:24):**  doing that?  
**[0:43:25-0:43:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:25):**  Oh, great.  
**[0:43:26-0:43:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:26):**  Can we like, we'd love to monitor and gather the data and stuff.  
**[0:43:30-0:43:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:30):**  So you can really see how it has just picked up.  
**[0:43:33-0:43:38](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:33):**  It'd be like something that used to just be looked at as I don't know, something eco,  
**[0:43:38-0:43:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:38):**  whatever.  
**[0:43:39-0:43:41](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:39):**  Now they're like, ah, yeah, it really makes sense.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:48](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:41):**  Like there's also there's an economic rationale behind trying to understand complex ecosystems.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:48):**  So yeah, perfect.  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:49):**  Let's go.  
**[0:43:50-0:43:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:50):**  So that's really beautiful.  
**[0:43:51-0:43:55](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:51):**  And I'm actually really, really grateful and happy for the partners that we have, the  
**[0:43:55-0:44:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:43:55):**  KTBL, the New School Institute, Enlightenment Institutes, there's really, you know, just  
**[0:44:01-0:44:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:01):**  great partners that help us gather some of the information and the data.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:05):**  And to be honest with you, even more so like, we have so many initiatives now in Germany  
**[0:44:11-0:44:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:11):**  who do very similar things that we do, and they also gather the data.  
**[0:44:14-0:44:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:14):**  So I think that's really great because it's not just us, it's like a lot of different  
**[0:44:20-0:44:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:20):**  cool and progressive initiatives in Germany that are looking in the same kind of philosophies  
**[0:44:26-0:44:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:26):**  and bringing different universities and different institutes into it also.  
**[0:44:30-0:44:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:30):**  So I think there's a huge momentum also in the gathering of data.  
**[0:44:34-0:44:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:34):**  And then of course, which is like for us, like a really strong focus is the question  
**[0:44:39-0:44:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:39):**  of what do we do with the data?  
**[0:44:40-0:44:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:40):**  Like we need the data, of course, but then, you know, we still live in the 21st century.  
**[0:44:45-0:44:51](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:45):**  So where we really bring it together is when we now use that to actually develop software,  
**[0:44:51-0:44:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:51):**  to actually develop machines, to actually develop all of the things that we need in  
**[0:44:57-0:45:00](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:44:57):**  order to do scalable agriculture.  
**[0:45:00-0:45:04](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:00):**  I strongly believe that in the future, there will not be less people on the ground, there  
**[0:45:04-0:45:10](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:04):**  will be more people on the ground, just because of us realizing what agriculture actually  
**[0:45:10-0:45:11](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:10):**  is.  
**[0:45:11-0:45:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:11):**  But we still need to find ways that makes it economically feasible.  
**[0:45:15-0:45:21](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:15):**  We still need to find ways to have that being a work that is good for your health and not  
**[0:45:21-0:45:25](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:21):**  if you have a bad back after 20 years.  
**[0:45:25-0:45:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:25):**  And so the machines and the technology is a potential to, of course, help us immensely.  
**[0:45:30-0:45:40](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:30):**  But it's not to keep perversing on an exploitative ecosystem, only thinking blindly about yields.  
**[0:45:40-0:45:45](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:40):**  It's about understanding the complex ecosystems and what we need in a specific area, in a  
**[0:45:45-0:45:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:45):**  specific context, to produce food that is not only good for the people and the people  
**[0:45:50-0:45:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:50):**  that work producing it, but also kind with the animals and good for the ecosystem, and  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:45:57):**  thereby actually increasing the soil and growing biodiversity and just being beautiful.  
**[0:46:02-0:46:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:02):**  And it tastes good.  
**[0:46:03-0:46:05](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:03):**  It tastes good, yeah.  
**[0:46:05-0:46:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:05):**  And I think that's really also the next big step, people stepping in that are gifted in  
**[0:46:09-0:46:15](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:09):**  different areas and saying, OK, well, OK, I see a complex, syntropic agroforestry system  
**[0:46:15-0:46:20](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:15):**  where we also do grain between the tree rows and then the cows come in and then the chickens  
**[0:46:20-0:46:23](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:20):**  come in and then we harvest berries from the systems.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:23):**  OK, that's the system I need to develop a technology for, a software for.  
**[0:46:26-0:46:27](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:26):**  OK, perfect.  
**[0:46:27-0:46:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:27):**  Do you have some data?  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:28):**  Yes.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:30](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:29):**  All right, let's go.  
**[0:46:30-0:46:33](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:30):**  I think, you know, that's it's going to be beautiful.  
**[0:46:33-0:46:35](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:33):**  I think it's a perfect place to end, Vanne Dijk.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:35):**  I want to thank you so much for your energy and all the work you bring to the space and  
**[0:46:39-0:46:43](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:39):**  also for taking an hour this morning to, in your very, very busy day, you have to go to  
**[0:46:43-0:46:49](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:43):**  a TV shoot after this, to talk to us and update a bit on what has been happening.  
**[0:46:49-0:46:50](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:49):**  So thank you so much.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:52](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:50):**  And we'll be checking in hopefully soon again.  
**[0:46:52-0:46:57](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:52):**  Yeah, thank you so much also for your very kind words, which I really not, you know,  
**[0:46:57-0:47:01](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:46:57):**  I'm just the clown that talks about it, but it's really the people out there and many  
**[0:47:01-0:47:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:47:01):**  others that should get the praise.  
**[0:47:03-0:47:07](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:47:03):**  But likewise, I want to thank you for all the work that you've done in the space and

**[0:49:51-0:49:53](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:49:51):**  So you don't have to write along.  
**[0:49:53-0:49:58](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:49:53):**  We're going to look into why invest in regenerative agriculture and why extractive agriculture  
**[0:49:58-0:50:03](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:49:58):**  is so risky, how to invest, what kind of frameworks you could and I think should build, what to  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:03):**  invest in, what kind of co-investors you could find or what kind of investors you could find  
**[0:50:08-0:50:09](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:08):**  if you're a soil builder.  
**[0:50:09-0:50:14](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:09):**  Every lesson will have a digging deeper part where I will share what kind of reports, what  
**[0:50:14-0:50:18](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:14):**  kind of interviews, what kind of videos you can look into if you want to dig deeper.

**[0:50:23-0:50:24](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:23):**  So what is it not?  
**[0:50:24-0:50:26](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:24):**  It's not a list of investable deals.  
**[0:50:26-0:50:28](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:26):**  Unfortunately that doesn't exist in this world.  
**[0:50:28-0:50:32](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:28):**  We're really at the beginning of the regenerative agriculture and food revolution.  
**[0:50:32-0:50:34](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:32):**  It's also not investment advice.  
**[0:50:34-0:50:39](https://investinginregenerativeagriculture.com/benedikt-boesel#t=0:50:34):**  Before making any investment, please find professional investment advice.
