**[0:02:32-0:02:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:32):**  All right, guys, thanks so much for coming all together.  
**[0:02:35-0:02:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:35):**  We're here with the rock stars from the last previous seasons of the podcast.  
**[0:02:39-0:02:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:39):**  I've got Shad Goodsy from Atitlan Organics.  
**[0:02:42-0:02:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:42):**  Hey.  
**[0:02:43-0:02:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:43):**  I've got Neil and Jeremy from Granjas Aquín.  
**[0:02:48-0:02:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:48):**  Yo.  
**[0:02:49-0:02:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:49):**  Hey, guys.  
**[0:02:50-0:02:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:50):**  And we're wrapping up a month of focus on building soil for market gardening.  
**[0:02:55-0:03:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:55):**  And seen as that's the primary operation for both of these farms that that these guys have  
**[0:03:01-0:03:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:01):**  developed.  
**[0:03:02-0:03:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:02):**  Let's go around and start talking a little bit about, first of all, how you build soil  
**[0:03:07-0:03:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:07):**  to create as much fertility on what is otherwise fairly marginal land.  
**[0:03:12-0:03:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:12):**  So Chad, Chad, why don't you start us off?  
**[0:03:15-0:03:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:15):**  I know that you have a unique system because you produce a lot with your chickens, both  
**[0:03:19-0:03:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:19):**  as meat products and for eggs.  
**[0:03:22-0:03:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:22):**  And you found an ingenious way of composting a lot of the organic matter that you put into  
**[0:03:27-0:03:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:27):**  the pens, as well as the nitrogen rich manure from the chickens, primarily for the production  
**[0:03:33-0:03:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:33):**  of salad greens on your farm.  
**[0:03:34-0:03:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:34):**  Could you elaborate a little bit about that system?  
**[0:03:36-0:03:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:36):**  Yeah, sure.  
**[0:03:37-0:03:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:37):**  Thanks, Oliver.  
**[0:03:38-0:03:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:38):**  Yeah, it's good to be here.  
**[0:03:41-0:03:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:41):**  So you mentioned the chickens and the topic is more market gardens.  
**[0:03:46-0:03:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:46):**  We maintain two different breeds of chicken on the Ati'Lad organics farm.  
**[0:03:51-0:03:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:51):**  So we have the meat birds, which are the Cornish cross, the traditional typical meat bird.  
**[0:03:57-0:04:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:57):**  They live pretty much exclusively outside, mainly in the food forest.  
**[0:04:02-0:04:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:02):**  So they're very rarely working in the market garden.  
**[0:04:05-0:04:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:05):**  We do get some kind of, I would say it's quite anaerobic kind of compacted compost from their  
**[0:04:13-0:04:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:13):**  house, but they're only there at night.  
**[0:04:15-0:04:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:15):**  We just bed it down every day with hay.  
**[0:04:18-0:04:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:18):**  Most of the time, the majority of their manure is just cycled through the food forest.  
**[0:04:22-0:04:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:22):**  But the hens are a different breed of chicken.  
**[0:04:25-0:04:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:25):**  It's a leg horn cross, more suited for tropical environments.  
**[0:04:30-0:04:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:30):**  And so we use them pretty much exclusively to fuel the salad fertility, which is our  
**[0:04:35-0:04:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:35):**  main product on the farm.  
**[0:04:38-0:04:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:38):**  We do let our hens out sometimes into vegetable areas or food forest.  
**[0:04:42-0:04:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:42):**  We really designed both of our main hen houses, which are each designed to hold a hundred  
**[0:04:47-0:04:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:47):**  hens.  
**[0:04:48-0:04:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:48):**  So it's 200 total spread across two houses.  
**[0:04:50-0:04:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:50):**  The houses respect the various parameters so that under the chickens, a deep hot compost  
**[0:04:57-0:05:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:57):**  pile can just naturally occur and be maintained mostly by the hens.  
**[0:05:02-0:05:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:02):**  And those parameters are things like five square feet per hen and a minimum of three  
**[0:05:09-0:05:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:09):**  feet of deep organic matter in the compost pile.  
**[0:05:13-0:05:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:13):**  And when you have that depth of material, the bottom most layer is pretty much always  
**[0:05:19-0:05:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:19):**  finished compost.  
**[0:05:20-0:05:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:20):**  So when we turn a salad bed, we pull the remaining plants out, feed them to the chickens, and  
**[0:05:25-0:05:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:25):**  then dig the third layer down in their deep compost bedding.  
**[0:05:29-0:05:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:29):**  And that's ready made compost to add to the salad bed.  
**[0:05:35-0:05:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:35):**  Have you found any difficulties in this system or ways that you can improve the efficiency  
**[0:05:40-0:05:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:40):**  of it over the amount of time that you've been trying this out?  
**[0:05:43-0:05:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:43):**  Yeah, so this is definitely, so for anyone interested, all of these plans and details  
**[0:05:49-0:05:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:49):**  are outlined in our composting chickens comic book, which is available for five bucks on  
**[0:05:56-0:05:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:56):**  the Permies marketplace and on Amazon.  
**[0:05:58-0:06:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:58):**  So if you look up Ativan Organics composting chickens, you can get the 30 page super hip,  
**[0:06:04-0:06:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:04):**  super sweet comic book, which has all this information and more.  
**[0:06:08-0:06:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:08):**  But yeah, to give you guys a glimpse and some of the things I've learned through processing  
**[0:06:12-0:06:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:12):**  and since publishing that comic book.  
**[0:06:15-0:06:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:15):**  So it's scale neutral.  
**[0:06:17-0:06:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:17):**  So you can have five hens, you can have 50 hens, you can have 100 hens.  
**[0:06:22-0:06:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:22):**  A natural size limit of hen flocks kind of in nature is about 200, 250.  
**[0:06:28-0:06:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:28):**  So not recommend building a house that accommodates more than 200 hens, you're better off breaking  
**[0:06:32-0:06:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:32):**  them into two.  
**[0:06:33-0:06:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:33):**  So if you have five hens, as long as you respect that space perimeter of five square foot per  
**[0:06:37-0:06:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:37):**  hen, you think in meters, it's two hens per square meter.  
**[0:06:41-0:06:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:41):**  Then with five hens, you can basically have a deep compost pile and have eggs and everything  
**[0:06:48-0:06:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:48):**  I talked about is similar with 50.  
**[0:06:50-0:06:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:50):**  There'll be different advantages to various designs depending on how many chickens you  
**[0:06:55-0:06:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:55):**  have.  
**[0:06:56-0:07:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:56):**  For people, I've seen houses built with 10 or 15 chickens and they have these kind of  
**[0:07:00-0:07:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:00):**  like trap doors.  
**[0:07:01-0:07:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:01):**  So the walls on the side of the chicken houses, the wall at the bottom say 50 centimeters  
**[0:07:07-0:07:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:07):**  or two feet is a swing door so that you can reach in from the outside and more easily  
**[0:07:14-0:07:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:14):**  harvest the compost.  
**[0:07:15-0:07:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:15):**  That works really nice for smaller houses.  
**[0:07:17-0:07:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:17):**  Ours are slightly too large for that.  
**[0:07:19-0:07:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:19):**  We found that keeping them watered, not sopping wet, but irrigating them as if it was a garden  
**[0:07:25-0:07:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:25):**  bed, that compost pile really helps accelerate the breakdown and also just kind of like digging  
**[0:07:31-0:07:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:31):**  random holes in there as part of our chicken maintenance is just going into the house in  
**[0:07:34-0:07:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:34):**  the morning, picking a hole, picking a corner or a space where we haven't done this in a  
**[0:07:39-0:07:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:39):**  little while and dig a hole there.  
**[0:07:40-0:07:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:40):**  And then they come in and dig down that bottom part.  
**[0:07:43-0:07:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:43):**  I could talk for more, we've tried to integrate other animals into it, hanging rabbit cages  
**[0:07:47-0:07:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:47):**  above the chickens also help fuel that compost pile with their urine, with the poop and the  
**[0:07:53-0:07:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:53):**  greens that they've made dirty but don't eat.  
**[0:07:55-0:07:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:55):**  We've tried pigs in there.  
**[0:07:57-0:08:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:57):**  That works really well until the pigs start eating the chickens and there's a lot of other  
**[0:08:02-0:08:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:02):**  kind of design potential with that basic idea of keeping your hands on a compost pile.  
**[0:08:10-0:08:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:10):**  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense and I like how you mentioned that it can be facilitated by  
**[0:08:15-0:08:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:15):**  watering the beds because what I've seen in both your application and in other places,  
**[0:08:20-0:08:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:20):**  because it gets so hot at those lower layers, it actually evaporates off a lot of the moisture  
**[0:08:24-0:08:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:24):**  and you want to kind of maintain that balance for ideal decomposition.  
**[0:08:31-0:08:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:31):**  Now Neil, you and Jeremy have developed a fantastic multi-tiered system on Granja's  
**[0:08:38-0:08:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:38):**  Siqin site with multiple animals contributing to the composting.  
**[0:08:42-0:08:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:42):**  Can you tell us a little bit about how those animals work in synergy, not just to create  
**[0:08:47-0:08:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:47):**  compost but also for the cleanliness of the pen?  
**[0:08:52-0:08:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:52):**  Sure.  
**[0:08:53-0:08:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:53):**  Yeah, the animals we work with are goats and chickens mainly and then we also have some  
**[0:08:59-0:09:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:59):**  ducks that have been really surprisingly prolific because we've just actually given a present  
**[0:09:05-0:09:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:05):**  of some ducks.  
**[0:09:06-0:09:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:06):**  But they've kind of found their way into that system and they're doing well in it.  
**[0:09:10-0:09:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:10):**  But really it works, I think, mostly because of the goat house, placing the chicken house  
**[0:09:16-0:09:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:16):**  below the goat house.  
**[0:09:18-0:09:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:18):**  It's like an idea really that I got from Shad, one of the things I like about the way Shad  
**[0:09:25-0:09:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:25):**  teaches is there's like mantras for every kind of subject that I think are really important.  
**[0:09:32-0:09:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:32):**  One of the mantras for the animal system is this like natural process where omnivores  
**[0:09:37-0:09:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:37):**  follow herbivores.  
**[0:09:40-0:09:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:40):**  And I guess like in a larger farm, which we don't have, where we had pasture, we would  
**[0:09:45-0:09:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:45):**  probably do goats in a section of the pasture being moved on a daily basis and being followed  
**[0:09:54-0:09:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:54):**  by chickens.  
**[0:09:55-0:09:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:55):**  That's kind of how that would work.  
**[0:09:56-0:10:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:56):**  But because we don't have that type of farm, as you said, we kind of have marginal land  
**[0:10:00-0:10:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:00):**  and not a huge amount of it.  
**[0:10:02-0:10:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:02):**  It was easier to do stationary houses where we take the goats out to walk and then the  
**[0:10:06-0:10:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:06):**  chicken house is really just kind of like a rip off of Shad's deep bedding chicken house.  
**[0:10:13-0:10:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:13):**  An elaboration.  
**[0:10:14-0:10:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:14):**  There we go.  
**[0:10:16-0:10:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:16):**  For copyright reasons.  
**[0:10:18-0:10:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:18):**  It works on like, it's essentially two terraces.  
**[0:10:24-0:10:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:24):**  The thing is built on a slope.  
**[0:10:25-0:10:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:25):**  So it's a goat house and then two levels of the chicken house below that.  
**[0:10:30-0:10:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:30):**  And really what we do is instead of turning compost piles, we just successively move it  
**[0:10:35-0:10:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:35):**  down through levels.  
**[0:10:36-0:10:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:36):**  So we clean out the goat house about every three or four weeks and it goes on to the  
**[0:10:40-0:10:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:40):**  first level of the chicken house.  
**[0:10:44-0:10:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:44):**  And the goat manure is quite anaerobic.  
**[0:10:47-0:10:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:47):**  I think goat manure is like really, really high quality because goats are browsers and  
**[0:10:52-0:10:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:52):**  they have very high mineral requirements.  
**[0:10:55-0:11:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:55):**  And so they eat a lot of these like mineral dense plants and then poop it out of the house.  
**[0:11:00-0:11:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:00):**  But they really do compact the manure and you see it when you clean up the house.  
**[0:11:03-0:11:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:03):**  It's like not, it would not be suitable for putting straight onto your garden, but the  
**[0:11:08-0:11:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:08):**  chickens love it.  
**[0:11:09-0:11:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:09):**  And the way we've designed the house is that chickens can get in there kind of pretty much  
**[0:11:13-0:11:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:13):**  any time during the day, which does work nicely.  
**[0:11:15-0:11:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:15):**  They kind of go in and the often will just even like sit on the back of the goat and  
**[0:11:20-0:11:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:20):**  pick, pick bugs off them.  
**[0:11:22-0:11:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:22):**  But they also scratch around a lot and eat the little bugs that start developing the  
**[0:11:27-0:11:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:27):**  goat manure.  
**[0:11:28-0:11:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:28):**  But yeah, then we open the door once every two or four weeks, put the goat house down  
**[0:11:33-0:11:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:33):**  into the first level of the chicken house, then the first level of the chicken house  
**[0:11:37-0:11:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:37):**  down into the second level.  
**[0:11:39-0:11:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:39):**  And then we eventually have a door down at the bottom of the chicken house where we throw  
**[0:11:43-0:11:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:43):**  the piles out and we make like hot piles that we turn one or two more times.  
**[0:11:49-0:11:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:49):**  And it works.  
**[0:11:50-0:11:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:50):**  The compost pile is especially towards the end of the process, even within the chicken  
**[0:11:56-0:11:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:56):**  house, it's just like Chad says, if you dig down, it gets really hot.  
**[0:11:59-0:12:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:59):**  But then we find that when we make up the big piles, it really does start to cook down.  
**[0:12:05-0:12:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:05):**  We cover them with plastic at that stage, which is ideal for us because that means we  
**[0:12:10-0:12:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:10):**  don't have to keep watering.  
**[0:12:11-0:12:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:11):**  As you mentioned, Oliver, the inside of the pile and it's really hard such to just evaporate  
**[0:12:17-0:12:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:17):**  all the water and can get dry.  
**[0:12:19-0:12:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:19):**  But if you have the plastic over it, it almost distills and rains back down into it.  
**[0:12:24-0:12:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:24):**  And so, it kind of creates this sort of like interior hydrologic cycle.  
**[0:12:28-0:12:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:28):**  Sounds really fancy but just kind of like cover it.  
**[0:12:31-0:12:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:31):**  It helped actually a lot with the quality from a kind of a qualitative point of view  
**[0:12:36-0:12:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:36):**  and quantitative actually was during coffee season, like building the coffee production  
**[0:12:41-0:12:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:41):**  facilities and depulping sort of five to 10 hundred pound sacks of coffee every day from  
**[0:12:48-0:12:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:48):**  the community.  
**[0:12:51-0:12:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:51):**  A lot of that we had planned and just putting it to one side and using it for lumber compost.  
**[0:12:56-0:13:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:56):**  But what we actually found over time is it was easier to take kind of well up to slightly  
**[0:13:02-0:13:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:02):**  over half of it and just put it down into the first level of that chicken house as well.  
**[0:13:07-0:13:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:07):**  And the moisture that that has, we noticed the compost really broke down and was improved  
**[0:13:13-0:13:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:13):**  by the addition of that material.  
**[0:13:15-0:13:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:15):**  So, yeah, that's another.  
**[0:13:18-0:13:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:18):**  Have you found that in both cases that at least to a certain degree, the feed costs  
**[0:13:23-0:13:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:23):**  for the chickens is reduced because they're actually eating a lot of bugs or what they  
**[0:13:28-0:13:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:28):**  call bitchos or little parasites that otherwise live, especially in the case of the goats  
**[0:13:32-0:13:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:32):**  in the manure or even around the goats directly?  
**[0:13:36-0:13:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:36):**  And has it made a significant difference in the nutrition levels and the variety of diet  
**[0:13:42-0:13:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:42):**  for the animals?  
**[0:13:44-0:13:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:44):**  Yeah, okay.  
**[0:13:46-0:13:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:46):**  I was just kind of starting to do the math in my head and I haven't finished.  
**[0:13:52-0:13:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:52):**  Yeah, so kind of recommended for our hens, for example, the breed of hen that we work  
**[0:13:57-0:14:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:57):**  with, the recommended kind of feed per hen is about a quarter pound a day, possibly a  
**[0:14:06-0:14:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:06):**  bit more.  
**[0:14:07-0:14:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:07):**  And this is concentrated feed?  
**[0:14:08-0:14:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:08):**  That would be like the industrial recommendation, basically.  
**[0:14:12-0:14:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:12):**  Concentrated feed, no other feed source, just that.  
**[0:14:16-0:14:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:16):**  A quarter to a third of a pound a day per hen.  
**[0:14:19-0:14:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:19):**  So four hens would eat a pound.  
**[0:14:22-0:14:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:22):**  And I know it's like at least six of our hens eat a pound, possibly more than six will get  
**[0:14:28-0:14:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:28):**  a pound.  
**[0:14:29-0:14:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:29):**  I would have to give you the number exactly.  
**[0:14:30-0:14:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:30):**  But I'd say we see at least like a 50% reduction in the amount of store bought feed or non-farm  
**[0:14:38-0:14:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:38):**  grown feed by using the kitchen scraps and the hot compost pile.  
**[0:14:46-0:14:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:46):**  For sure.  
**[0:14:47-0:14:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:47):**  And now we all know that the quantity of nitrogen, especially in droppings from chickens and  
**[0:14:55-0:14:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:55):**  certainly the urine from other animals is very significant.  
**[0:14:59-0:15:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:59):**  And it can be tough to kind of balance out the carbon to nitrogen ratio that would make  
**[0:15:06-0:15:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:06):**  ideal compost.  
**[0:15:08-0:15:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:08):**  And I know that we mostly started out using straw that was imported from the coast as  
**[0:15:15-0:15:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:15):**  the primary source of carbon in these systems, but we've been playing around with different  
**[0:15:19-0:15:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:19):**  sources as well in an effort to try and, I guess, wean ourselves off of inputs from outside  
**[0:15:28-0:15:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:28):**  and try and bring as much carbon from the community rather than relying on outside sources.  
**[0:15:32-0:15:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:32):**  Have you found any success with using leaf litter or other forms of carbon that are more  
**[0:15:38-0:15:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:38):**  readily available in the local area?  
**[0:15:42-0:15:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:42):**  I'll also talk on that one quickly.  
**[0:15:46-0:15:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:46):**  A few comments on that.  
**[0:15:50-0:15:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:50):**  Here in Guatemala, where we are in the highlands of Sololah, there's less infrastructure.  
**[0:15:57-0:16:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:57):**  So it would be different if you're in a place where there's roads and municipalities that  
**[0:16:01-0:16:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:01):**  maintain like public areas and there's tree trimmers and things like that.  
**[0:16:05-0:16:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:05):**  You pretty much get loads of that stuff pretty easily.  
**[0:16:09-0:16:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:09):**  Here in our particular situation, organic matter is more difficult to come by.  
**[0:16:13-0:16:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:13):**  I'm not at all interested in weaning myself off straw that I buy from the coast.  
**[0:16:18-0:16:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:18):**  I want to buy more.  
**[0:16:19-0:16:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:19):**  I would like to be able to have the farm afford to buy three times or four times the amount  
**[0:16:25-0:16:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:25):**  we're currently buying every year.  
**[0:16:27-0:16:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:27):**  Just to be clear, I think there's a lot of systems in nature that use, like, there's  
**[0:16:33-0:16:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:33):**  no such thing as a closed system in nature.  
**[0:16:37-0:16:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:37):**  The earth itself isn't even closed.  
**[0:16:38-0:16:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:38):**  I read the other day, 85 million pounds of cosmic dust lands and settles on the earth  
**[0:16:47-0:16:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:47):**  every year.  
**[0:16:48-0:16:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:48):**  So the earth is getting heavier by 85 million pounds of cosmic dust.  
**[0:16:52-0:16:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:52):**  How crazy is that?  
**[0:16:53-0:16:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:53):**  There's no such thing as a closed system in nature.  
**[0:16:56-0:17:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:56):**  And actually what a lot of systems in nature have is you have these intensive focal points  
**[0:17:01-0:17:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:01):**  that consume and then lots of broader scape that tend to provide for the consumption in  
**[0:17:08-0:17:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:08):**  more densely focused areas.  
**[0:17:09-0:17:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:09):**  You see it in a cell with the mitochondria and the nucleus.  
**[0:17:13-0:17:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:13):**  Majority of the cell is there to promote the nucleus's growth in there and that functionality.  
**[0:17:19-0:17:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:19):**  I see this bringing in hay and bringing in carbon as the mitochondria for the farm.  
**[0:17:24-0:17:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:24):**  And I'll take that from anywhere as long as it's like a sustainable source that's coming  
**[0:17:29-0:17:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:29):**  from it.  
**[0:17:30-0:17:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:30):**  There's some other stuff, but yeah.  
**[0:17:32-0:17:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:32):**  Yeah.  
**[0:17:33-0:17:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:33):**  What about you guys?  
**[0:17:34-0:17:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:34):**  Because, you know, maybe you're not trying to wean off of it directly, but I know that  
**[0:17:37-0:17:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:37):**  we've experimented with other forms of carbon on the farm.  
**[0:17:41-0:17:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:41):**  Have you found any advantages or disadvantages from the sources that we have closer around  
**[0:17:46-0:17:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:46):**  in the local community?  
**[0:17:49-0:17:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:49):**  Yeah, we do find some other materials that are quite close by.  
**[0:17:54-0:17:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:54):**  Sometimes we'll have neighbors that will be cleaning out what they call brossa or like  
**[0:17:59-0:18:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:59):**  this sort of forest mulch on the bottoms of their coffee growing areas because they do  
**[0:18:04-0:18:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:04):**  weeding and they clean this stuff out oftentimes and they're looking to, they know it's a great  
**[0:18:09-0:18:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:09):**  source of carbon and it's not just carbon.  
**[0:18:12-0:18:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:12):**  It's got a lot of interesting sort of microbial growth in it from the forest, which gives  
**[0:18:18-0:18:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:18):**  it a nice potential in that way to diversify the soil communities that you're working with.  
**[0:18:25-0:18:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:25):**  So it has that benefit to it.  
**[0:18:29-0:18:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:29):**  I agree with Shad, the straw is a beautiful resource.  
**[0:18:34-0:18:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:34):**  It stays a bit more aerobic.  
**[0:18:37-0:18:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:37):**  It doesn't get compacted as easily.  
**[0:18:39-0:18:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:39):**  So it definitely creates a healthier compost.  
**[0:18:42-0:18:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:42):**  In some ways the leaves get packed down almost immediately.  
**[0:18:44-0:18:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:44):**  Sawdust.  
**[0:18:45-0:18:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:45):**  Oh sure, because of the air pockets in the straw.  
**[0:18:47-0:18:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:47):**  Yeah.  
**[0:18:48-0:18:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:48):**  And it insulates the pile, which is really, really helpful.  
**[0:18:53-0:18:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:53):**  And I also agree that I don't see it being a serious problem.  
**[0:18:57-0:19:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:57):**  It doesn't create too much of a cost issue.  
**[0:19:01-0:19:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:01):**  It's pretty, it's not the most expensive thing to pull in.  
**[0:19:04-0:19:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:04):**  And I guess the only thing I would look for is maybe a more nutrient rich straw if possible.  
**[0:19:12-0:19:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:12):**  That's the stuff that we get, the goats aren't super excited about it.  
**[0:19:18-0:19:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:18):**  Maybe like barley, if there's barley production somewhere getting the stocks off of that would  
**[0:19:22-0:19:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:22):**  be a great one.  
**[0:19:23-0:19:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:23):**  And something you can feed for the, especially in dry season, something like that would be  
**[0:19:27-0:19:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:27):**  amazing.  
**[0:19:28-0:19:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:28):**  So we've talked now a lot about the base of the systems and the fundamentals of how they  
**[0:19:32-0:19:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:32):**  work.  
**[0:19:33-0:19:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:33):**  But I know that in both cases on both farms you've made efforts to improve the process  
**[0:19:39-0:19:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:39):**  with a few other inputs.  
**[0:19:40-0:19:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:40):**  So let's talk first about EM's.  
**[0:19:42-0:19:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:42):**  Who wants to explain a little bit about what EM's are, how you brew them, and some of the  
**[0:19:48-0:19:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:48):**  ways that you've used them to accelerate the compost and improve the quality.  
**[0:19:51-0:19:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:51):**  Neil, you want to start with that?  
**[0:19:53-0:19:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:53):**  Sure.  
**[0:19:55-0:20:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:55):**  To be honest, I don't really fully understand this stuff that well.  
**[0:20:01-0:20:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:01):**  You know, my EM's were talking about effective microorganisms.  
**[0:20:09-0:20:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:09):**  I read a little bit about this stuff and I have a friend who's a distributor of what  
**[0:20:16-0:20:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:16):**  they call it.  
**[0:20:17-0:20:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:17):**  Like inoculant?  
**[0:20:18-0:20:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:18):**  Yeah.  
**[0:20:19-0:20:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:19):**  Like he sells basically, I think laboratory prepared solutions.  
**[0:20:25-0:20:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:25):**  And they're kind of like kombucha starters.  
**[0:20:29-0:20:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:29):**  You put them in a plastic container and you do a lactoform and you add food source and  
**[0:20:35-0:20:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:35):**  you dilute them down and they proliferate.  
**[0:20:37-0:20:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:37):**  As I understand it, it's a kind of a patented product that has the right mix of symbiotic  
**[0:20:47-0:20:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:47):**  bacteria that work, yeah, that work symbiotically in your soil to eliminate pathogens, to break  
**[0:20:55-0:21:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:55):**  down organic material in a kind of an optimal way.  
**[0:21:01-0:21:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:01):**  I definitely think that EM's and bacteria and compost teas in general are not, they're  
**[0:21:07-0:21:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:07):**  no substitute for carbon.  
**[0:21:10-0:21:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:10):**  I think they're almost like icing on the cake a little bit, but there's no substitute for  
**[0:21:15-0:21:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:15):**  like just raw large amounts of organic, broken down organic material.  
**[0:21:20-0:21:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:20):**  And honestly what I do is this friend of mine, he gave me, kind of gave me a present of like  
**[0:21:27-0:21:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:27):**  a starter kit for these EM's and I started them in a drum probably about a year ago.  
**[0:21:32-0:21:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:32):**  And then I was smelling it and I was just like, just like kombucha is what it smells  
**[0:21:40-0:21:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:40):**  like.  
**[0:21:41-0:21:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:41):**  Or sauerkraut or something or whatever.  
**[0:21:42-0:21:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:42):**  And it gets like this white scum layer on the top that anyone who's done any home fermenting  
**[0:21:46-0:21:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:46):**  will do.  
**[0:21:47-0:21:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:47):**  And I started to kind of be like, there's no way, you know, it's not really, I'm not  
**[0:21:52-0:21:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:52):**  the type of person I guess who likes to buy things that come in a shiny plastic container.  
**[0:21:58-0:22:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:58):**  Especially not if you can make them yourself, right?  
**[0:22:00-0:22:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:00):**  And I don't know if I can, but anyway, what I started doing, what I started doing, and  
**[0:22:06-0:22:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:06):**  this is maybe some listener will be kind enough to write in and tell me how wrong I am about  
**[0:22:10-0:22:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:10):**  all this.  
**[0:22:12-0:22:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:12):**  I kind of, I never let the drum get empty.  
**[0:22:15-0:22:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:15):**  So I'm assuming it has a lot of these original microbes from the starter kit that we started  
**[0:22:21-0:22:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:21):**  with, but really I just top it up.  
**[0:22:24-0:22:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:24):**  We live next door to our wonderful neighbors, Jared and Michelle who run Love Probiotics  
**[0:22:29-0:22:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:29):**  and have a great line of fermented products that they sell here on Lake Atitlana and in  
**[0:22:34-0:22:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:34):**  Antigua.  
**[0:22:35-0:22:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:35):**  And they do kombuchas, ginger beer, junes, and every now and again they give me like  
**[0:22:39-0:22:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:39):**  a scoby or some leftover fermented ginger.  
**[0:22:43-0:22:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:43):**  And then at the farm we also make a lot of cheese, so we have a lot of whey, which is  
**[0:22:47-0:22:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:47):**  another kind of probiotic thing.  
**[0:22:50-0:22:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:50):**  And we're always doing little ferments, we make our own ginger beer, we make our own  
**[0:22:54-0:22:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:54):**  sourdough bread.  
**[0:22:55-0:23:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:55):**  And so anytime I have a leftover something and I just put it into the bucket and I keep  
**[0:23:02-0:23:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:02):**  it topped up with whey, panella, which is unprocessed cane sugar, and water from the  
**[0:23:11-0:23:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:11):**  river that doesn't have chlorine in it, I think is important.  
**[0:23:15-0:23:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:15):**  We just keep it topped up and we spray it on the garden once a week.  
**[0:23:18-0:23:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:18):**  We had been spraying it on the compost piles, but then we started to notice these things  
**[0:23:22-0:23:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:22):**  are getting so hot anyway, they're obviously full of all kinds of microbial life.  
**[0:23:26-0:23:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:26):**  So we're just adding a tiny bit on top maybe isn't it?  
**[0:23:30-0:23:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:30):**  And they're probably all competed by these extremely.  
**[0:23:32-0:23:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:32):**  But whatever else is in there and it's probably a lot of the same stuff.  
**[0:23:36-0:23:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:36):**  So what we actually do with this stuff mostly now is we sweeten our animal feeds with it.  
**[0:23:42-0:23:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:42):**  It's kind of like one of the things, and we put a watering can to work on to the garden  
**[0:23:47-0:23:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:47):**  every week.  
**[0:23:48-0:23:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:48):**  So it's like you're kind of inoculating the plants and soil in the garden with it.  
**[0:23:54-0:24:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:54):**  And what we also do is just like sort of our goal is to feed our animals as much from the  
**[0:24:02-0:24:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:02):**  valley as we can.  
**[0:24:04-0:24:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:04):**  And we do, we feed our goats with about 80% fresh forage from the valley, which works  
**[0:24:11-0:24:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:11):**  I think is really great.  
**[0:24:12-0:24:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:12):**  But in order to get that real kick from their production really to kind of make it worthwhile,  
**[0:24:18-0:24:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:18):**  we do feed them some, we do give them some non-medicated concentrates.  
**[0:24:23-0:24:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:23):**  What we do with those is we just, we, it's actually, it's nice.  
**[0:24:29-0:24:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:29):**  I enjoy this process.  
**[0:24:30-0:24:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:30):**  Yeah, you do seem to.  
**[0:24:33-0:24:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:33):**  We mix, we mix in, so we take a five gallon bucket of the grain and then we mix in a handful  
**[0:24:40-0:24:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:40):**  of our own homemade mineral mix, which is actually biochar or activated carbon, which  
**[0:24:46-0:24:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:46):**  I'm sure Jer's going to talk about soon, which he, Jer, figured out an ingenious way of turning  
**[0:24:51-0:24:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:51):**  the coffee grains into biochar, sea salt, sodium bicarbonate, and ash.  
**[0:24:57-0:25:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:57):**  And we mix it in with that when it's dry and then we sweeten it with this kind of like,  
**[0:25:02-0:25:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:02):**  it tastes like a kind of a kombucha and the goats go crazy for it.  
**[0:25:08-0:25:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:08):**  They eat it much more ferociously than they would if it wasn't sweetened.  
**[0:25:14-0:25:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:14):**  And so it's kind of like, I kind of think it's like, okay, it's concentrate, but we're,  
**[0:25:18-0:25:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:18):**  we're certainly getting really good medicine into them at the same time, probiotics and  
**[0:25:22-0:25:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:22):**  especially the, especially the activated carbon because goats are very prone to parasites.  
**[0:25:28-0:25:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:28):**  So I think the fact that they're like taking regular small amounts of activated carbon  
**[0:25:33-0:25:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:33):**  has, and probiotics has to be helping to alleviate that tendency that they have.  
**[0:25:39-0:25:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:39):**  And then finally, like, I think in terms of soil building, for me, it's like very nice  
**[0:25:43-0:25:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:43):**  to think of all these like rich mineral sources becoming like microbially charged in the rumen  
**[0:25:52-0:25:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:52):**  of the goat.  
**[0:25:56-0:26:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:56):**  Where you know, as I understand it, I guess I've taken courses in this stuff, a lot of  
**[0:26:02-0:26:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:02):**  the science and stuff goes over my head, but as I understand it, like goats, rumens, and  
**[0:26:07-0:26:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:07):**  particularly any herbivore, their rumen is really like a kind of bio digester.  
**[0:26:12-0:26:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:12):**  And it has a lot of the microbes that are responsible for making minerals bioavailable  
**[0:26:20-0:26:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:20):**  to plants.  
**[0:26:21-0:26:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:21):**  There's a good quote by Elaine Ingham where she says, every mineral that every plant needs  
**[0:26:29-0:26:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:29):**  to survive is available in every handful of soil.  
**[0:26:33-0:26:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:33):**  And it's like, I think that's it, that might be wrong, but you know, something along those  
**[0:26:37-0:26:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:37):**  lines, but usually they're not available because the microbial communities aren't present in  
**[0:26:43-0:26:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:43):**  the soil to actually break down these inorganic particles and make them bioavailable.  
**[0:26:50-0:26:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:50):**  So you know, there's some really elaborate ways that soil scientists kind of talk about  
**[0:26:54-0:26:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:54):**  about doing this, but for me, just feeding them to goats and then passing that goat manure  
**[0:26:59-0:27:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:59):**  through a system and putting it out into your garden is a pretty passive way of sort of  
**[0:27:03-0:27:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:03):**  doing that, you know.  
**[0:27:05-0:27:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:05):**  Now Shet, have you used any extra additives or improvements for your own compost systems  
**[0:27:10-0:27:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:10):**  or are you at the point where the simpler the better and trying to cut out any excess  
**[0:27:15-0:27:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:15):**  steps?  
**[0:27:16-0:27:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:16):**  Yeah, so let's see, just I will, first I'll take a minute to just put a little bit of  
**[0:27:24-0:27:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:24):**  what Neil said in the context as well.  
**[0:27:28-0:27:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:28):**  I also am not really into these sorts of liquid fertilizer type things.  
**[0:27:37-0:27:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:37):**  But one key distinction that's worth noting for listeners or whoever's interested in possibly  
**[0:27:42-0:27:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:42):**  following such recipes, like what Neil was talking about with the EM, which then became  
**[0:27:47-0:27:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:47):**  kind of like just a probiotic living stew of whatever kind of probiotic sources you  
**[0:27:54-0:28:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:54):**  get, whether it was from a kombucha, etc. and he mentioned and then he'd get topped  
**[0:28:00-0:28:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:00):**  up with canela, which is basically sweetened water.  
**[0:28:03-0:28:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:03):**  So what Neil was describing there, that EM mix, which converted into other sort of active  
**[0:28:10-0:28:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:10):**  biological mix, they are all aerobic.  
**[0:28:14-0:28:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:14):**  They're aerobic fermentations.  
**[0:28:17-0:28:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:17):**  Lacto-fermentations are aerobic.  
**[0:28:18-0:28:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:18):**  It means they have oxygen.  
**[0:28:19-0:28:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:19):**  They're not happening in oxygen core conditions.  
**[0:28:23-0:28:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:23):**  They're happening in oxygen rich conditions.  
**[0:28:25-0:28:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:25):**  And so that is cool.  
**[0:28:28-0:28:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:28):**  Feed it to your animals, add it to the garden.  
**[0:28:31-0:28:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:31):**  It does all these things that Neil kind of talked about.  
**[0:28:35-0:28:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:35):**  It regenerates the biological communities, etc., etc.  
**[0:28:38-0:28:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:38):**  But then communally, then Neil started talking about the inside of the rumen of a goat.  
**[0:28:43-0:28:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:43):**  And then he said that actually it's kind of like a biodigester and that's exactly what  
**[0:28:48-0:28:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:48):**  it is.  
**[0:28:49-0:28:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:49):**  It's spot on.  
**[0:28:50-0:28:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:50):**  Those sorts of bacteria that live in that rumen are anaerobic.  
**[0:28:55-0:28:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:55):**  There's no oxygen in them.  
**[0:28:57-0:29:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:57):**  And what people often do with teas at home, so you're listening to this right now and  
**[0:29:02-0:29:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:02):**  you're like, this is sweet.  
**[0:29:03-0:29:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:03):**  I'm going to like put some stuff into a bucket and let it sit for a while.  
**[0:29:08-0:29:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:08):**  It will most likely turn anaerobic.  
**[0:29:10-0:29:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:10):**  It will become gross.  
**[0:29:11-0:29:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:11):**  It will smell gross.  
**[0:29:12-0:29:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:12):**  It won't smell like a nice kombucha or something you'd want to drink.  
**[0:29:16-0:29:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:16):**  It would be really disgusting.  
**[0:29:18-0:29:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:18):**  And so here we go to wrap that up.  
**[0:29:20-0:29:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:20):**  You have these aerobic ones and you have anaerobic ones.  
**[0:29:23-0:29:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:23):**  So aerobic are the probiotics.  
**[0:29:25-0:29:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:25):**  It's the E.M.s.  
**[0:29:26-0:29:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:26):**  It's all the life forms.  
**[0:29:27-0:29:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:27):**  And the anaerobic ones are not necessarily smelling really good, but they're the ones  
**[0:29:32-0:29:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:32):**  that make minerals bioavailable.  
**[0:29:35-0:29:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:35):**  And so keep that in mind.  
**[0:29:37-0:29:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:37):**  I would not want to put anaerobic shit on my garden.  
**[0:29:40-0:29:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:40):**  Like I would want to oxygenate it first or in the form of those anaerobic bacteria in  
**[0:29:45-0:29:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:45):**  the rumen and then the output of that rumen, the poop compulsive, it becomes biological  
**[0:29:51-0:29:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:51):**  again.  
**[0:29:52-0:29:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:52):**  So anaerobic stuff you want to treat with caution, but understand that they're the things  
**[0:29:55-0:29:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:55):**  that might be necessary to make the minerals available.  
**[0:29:58-0:30:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:58):**  And the aerobic, the oxygenated stuff is kind of good to drink, to spray on your garden,  
**[0:30:03-0:30:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:03):**  to do whatever with and to probably the best to chug it.  
**[0:30:05-0:30:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:05):**  The chat drew some of ours.  
**[0:30:06-0:30:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:06):**  We were doing garden club and I brought some up and chat thought it was a kombucha.  
**[0:30:13-0:30:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:13):**  I thought it was a kombucha and all these guys are like, and he was like, yeah, you  
**[0:30:18-0:30:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:18):**  can drink it.  
**[0:30:19-0:30:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:19):**  And I'm like kind of far away and then I'm watching all the people in the course and  
**[0:30:22-0:30:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:22):**  they're like taking the teeny sip and making these really like gross faces.  
**[0:30:25-0:30:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:25):**  And I'm just like, man, what has holes like Neil brought some sweet ginger beer.  
**[0:30:30-0:30:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:30):**  Didn't even tell me.  
**[0:30:31-0:30:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:31):**  No one wants to try it.  
**[0:30:33-0:30:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:33):**  They're all judgmental.  
**[0:30:34-0:30:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:34):**  They're like, this is gross.  
**[0:30:35-0:30:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:35):**  And then I just like went over and pounded like a meter of it.  
**[0:30:40-0:30:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:40):**  Oh my god.  
**[0:30:41-0:30:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:41):**  Oh my god.  
**[0:30:42-0:30:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:42):**  Well, you know, if it's good for you, go.  
**[0:30:45-0:30:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:45):**  It's like Neil needs to step up his ginger beer.  
**[0:30:48-0:30:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:48):**  Kind of tastes like old socks.  
**[0:30:51-0:30:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:51):**  I've been taking a little bit of a very similar product recently that I found that somebody  
**[0:30:56-0:31:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:56):**  is selling around here at the lake and it smells and tastes very similar to E.M.  
**[0:31:01-0:31:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:01):**  You're just supposed to take a cap full of it and mix it in with water, like put it in  
**[0:31:04-0:31:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:04):**  with a smoothie.  
**[0:31:05-0:31:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:05):**  But I've had great results from it.  
**[0:31:07-0:31:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:07):**  I've read that a lot of a lot of nutritionists are not a lot of nutritionists, but do take  
**[0:31:13-0:31:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:13):**  this E.M. product and just repackage it and sell it as a program.  
**[0:31:18-0:31:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:18):**  I would imagine that was happening.  
**[0:31:19-0:31:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:19):**  So yeah, so just like people are looking for this, go do some research.  
**[0:31:23-0:31:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:23):**  But the simplest way to do it is to just sweeten the water or aerate it.  
**[0:31:27-0:31:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:27):**  You need to put a pump in it.  
**[0:31:29-0:31:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:29):**  You can put some plants that are rich in minerals.  
**[0:31:31-0:31:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:31):**  You can put a little manure in there or soccer compost or something.  
**[0:31:34-0:31:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:34):**  Then you aerate it or add that probiotic thing that will make it bubble and feed it something  
**[0:31:39-0:31:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:39):**  sweet.  
**[0:31:40-0:31:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:40):**  That'll be aerobic and that's great.  
**[0:31:41-0:31:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:41):**  If you wanted to dabble in the anaerobic stuff, you would want to, after you get it, make  
**[0:31:48-0:31:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:48):**  it oxygenated before you put it in your garden.  
**[0:31:51-0:31:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:51):**  And just be wary of that stinky fermented tea that smells really gross because I see  
**[0:31:56-0:31:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:56):**  that happening a lot.  
**[0:31:57-0:31:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:57):**  People think that's a compost tea.  
**[0:31:58-0:31:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:58):**  It's not a compost tea.  
**[0:31:59-0:32:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:59):**  It's kind of like a mix of the two and it won't really do good for anything.  
**[0:32:04-0:32:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:04):**  Now going back to just my personal approach to it, I don't do that stuff just because  
**[0:32:09-0:32:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:09):**  in our setup and our scale, we don't just never fit for us.  
**[0:32:13-0:32:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:13):**  I have used fish emulsions, oxygenated fish emulsions in the past when I had sandy soil  
**[0:32:19-0:32:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:19):**  and no fertility.  
**[0:32:20-0:32:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:20):**  But we have more fertility on the farm.  
**[0:32:23-0:32:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:23):**  So I'm like the simplest thing that matters.  
**[0:32:25-0:32:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:25):**  I bring in the straw and any other organic matter and the restaurant scraps.  
**[0:32:31-0:32:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:31):**  And we basically are only compost pile and the whole entire farm is under our chickens.  
**[0:32:36-0:32:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:36):**  And anything that we don't burn goes in there.  
**[0:32:39-0:32:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:39):**  And that just suits our approach.  
**[0:32:40-0:32:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:40):**  Yeah.  
**[0:32:41-0:32:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:41):**  You have a super simple approach, which is really great from a learning point of view  
**[0:32:46-0:32:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:46):**  because you're like, wow.  
**[0:32:47-0:32:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:47):**  And from a business point of view, I mean, we're going to talk about this a little bit  
**[0:32:49-0:32:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:49):**  more in a minute, but efficiency is a huge aspect of making a farming or production model  
**[0:32:55-0:32:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:55):**  profitable.  
**[0:32:56-0:33:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:56):**  And if you add a whole bunch of unnecessary steps or maybe they're necessary, maybe they  
**[0:33:00-0:33:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:00):**  have a function, but if they can't be justified by the amount of time or human labor put into  
**[0:33:05-0:33:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:05):**  them, it's really hard to justify them in a profitable model.  
**[0:33:09-0:33:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:09):**  Now I know that there's one other main additive to the compost that especially Neil and Jeremy  
**[0:33:15-0:33:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:15):**  have been trying lately and that's biochar.  
**[0:33:17-0:33:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:17):**  And I know that Jeremy knows a lot more about this and has been experimenting with it on  
**[0:33:21-0:33:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:21):**  the farm.  
**[0:33:22-0:33:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:22):**  So do you want to tell us a little bit about the method that you've discovered for turning  
**[0:33:26-0:33:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:26):**  all of the coffee hulls into biochar and some of the other things you've been able to do  
**[0:33:32-0:33:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:32):**  with that method?  
**[0:33:34-0:33:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:34):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:35-0:33:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:35):**  Yeah.  
**[0:33:36-0:33:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:36):**  Sort of like the same style in mind as all the other things we talked about, really try  
**[0:33:42-0:33:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:42):**  to simplify it.  
**[0:33:44-0:33:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:44):**  And actually we're doing on quite a small scale compared to what other people might  
**[0:33:49-0:33:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:49):**  do.  
**[0:33:50-0:33:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:50):**  I'll also say it's probably not the most efficient system, but because it's on a small scale  
**[0:33:56-0:34:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:56):**  and we have waste product to use, it seems to work fine for us.  
**[0:34:01-0:34:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:01):**  And we try to use this system to do other things.  
**[0:34:03-0:34:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:03):**  I'll talk about in a minute, but like smoking, like smoke cooked chickens on the inside of  
**[0:34:10-0:34:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:10):**  the oven as you do the biochars, the way we found to like make it justifiable to really  
**[0:34:16-0:34:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:16):**  have the process go forward.  
**[0:34:17-0:34:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:17):**  Sure, it's not functioned via smoke chicken at the end.  
**[0:34:20-0:34:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:20):**  I mean, because otherwise you're just burning loads of fuel and you do get some product  
**[0:34:24-0:34:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:24):**  out of it, but there's a pretty high heat cost to doing it, which wouldn't work otherwise  
**[0:34:32-0:34:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:32):**  probably.  
**[0:34:33-0:34:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:33):**  So, I guess I'll explain real quick why biochar is important.  
**[0:34:39-0:34:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:39):**  All the other organic matter kind of, it's a form of carbon, inorganic carbon basically,  
**[0:34:47-0:34:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:47):**  and it works like organic matter in the soil or broken down living carbon, like what would  
**[0:34:53-0:34:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:53):**  come from hay or leaves.  
**[0:34:55-0:35:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:55):**  The thing about this organic carbon sources that create this black fluffy earth is that  
**[0:35:01-0:35:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:01):**  they eventually exhaust from the soil.  
**[0:35:03-0:35:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:03):**  The microbial communities use them as a calorie and they break it down and eventually it all  
**[0:35:11-0:35:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:11):**  gets exhausted into the air in the form of CO2.  
**[0:35:14-0:35:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:14):**  It seems like it's oxygen that goes back into the atmosphere.  
**[0:35:17-0:35:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:17):**  Exactly.  
**[0:35:18-0:35:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:18):**  Yeah, oxidized, whatever you want to call it.  
**[0:35:20-0:35:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:20):**  Or just turned into a class.  
**[0:35:23-0:35:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:23):**  Oh yeah, I mean the plants are creating more carbon thanks to the organic matter in the  
**[0:35:29-0:35:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:29):**  soil, but you do have to keep adding it as the idea.  
**[0:35:35-0:35:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:35):**  If you can cut out that step, that could mean huge things for any gardener.  
**[0:35:41-0:35:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:41):**  Bringing in the carbon is always a really extensive and continual process.  
**[0:35:49-0:35:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:49):**  What biochar basically does is create this organic matter in your soil to create communities  
**[0:35:53-0:36:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:53):**  for soil microorganisms to hold onto water, to hold onto nutrients really well.  
**[0:36:00-0:36:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:00):**  It does not exhaust from the soil because it's actually inorganic or it's become mineralized  
**[0:36:06-0:36:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:06):**  through this heating process.  
**[0:36:09-0:36:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:09):**  And what that means is it can exist in the soil much like any mineral for thousands of  
**[0:36:14-0:36:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:14):**  years or indefinitely, some people say it lasts like 10,000 to 30,000 years, which is  
**[0:36:21-0:36:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:21):**  like more than enough for me to really...  
**[0:36:24-0:36:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:24):**  Yeah, more than you need to remember.  
**[0:36:27-0:36:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:27):**  Which kind of has interesting ramifications, like you're creating permanent fertility on  
**[0:36:32-0:36:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:32):**  a piece of land, which really feels nice.  
**[0:36:37-0:36:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:37):**  The interesting thing is how do you actually make this stuff and what do you make it out  
**[0:36:40-0:36:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:40):**  of?  
**[0:36:41-0:36:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:41):**  A lot of people talk about this using any old bits of carbon like scraps of wood or  
**[0:36:47-0:36:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:47):**  leaves or sawdust.  
**[0:36:50-0:36:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:50):**  And the second two, I would say would be a better idea than scraps of wood because the  
**[0:36:54-0:36:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:54):**  scraps of wood are quite dense and they're all in different sizes.  
**[0:36:57-0:37:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:57):**  So, they don't break down at the same time into the black, you know, charcoal bits that  
**[0:37:02-0:37:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:02):**  you want to sort of powder, right?  
**[0:37:05-0:37:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:05):**  Which you can do it, but it's not very efficient because you're like...  
**[0:37:08-0:37:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:08):**  So, higher surface area is ideal?  
**[0:37:10-0:37:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:10):**  Higher surface area...  
**[0:37:11-0:37:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:11):**  Even heating and the product that you want...  
**[0:37:13-0:37:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:13):**  Break down and like the consistent texture...  
**[0:37:17-0:37:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:17):**  You want something that looks like activated charcoal.  
**[0:37:21-0:37:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:21):**  Already...  
**[0:37:22-0:37:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:22):**  Because that's kind of what it is really.  
**[0:37:23-0:37:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:23):**  Yeah, these powdery flakes of black stuff.  
**[0:37:27-0:37:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:27):**  And if you were looking under a microscope, it would look like a totally crazy looking  
**[0:37:31-0:37:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:31):**  sponge structure with all these little passageways and holes like micro pores in it, like you  
**[0:37:37-0:37:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:37):**  know, just so much.  
**[0:37:39-0:37:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:39):**  And what we use, you got to find the right material and make it one that's available  
**[0:37:43-0:37:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:43):**  hopefully free or if it's not free and abundant, free and abundant.  
**[0:37:48-0:37:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:48):**  We use the shells from the coffee, they're the hull of the coffee after you take the  
**[0:37:52-0:37:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:52):**  pulp off.  
**[0:37:53-0:38:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:53):**  There's this dry parchment shell around the outside, what they call it.  
**[0:38:00-0:38:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:00):**  And the buddy that roasts the coffee for us and for most people around our area has just  
**[0:38:06-0:38:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:06):**  so much of it.  
**[0:38:08-0:38:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:08):**  And you know, he's like using it as mulch and other things, but he's not really, you  
**[0:38:12-0:38:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:12):**  know, he's just kind of, oh yeah, that stuff.  
**[0:38:13-0:38:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:13):**  And it's not a great mulch really.  
**[0:38:15-0:38:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:15):**  It's kind of somewhat impermeable.  
**[0:38:17-0:38:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:17):**  Well, it doesn't soak up moisture in its raw form.  
**[0:38:21-0:38:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:21):**  It's silica rich, so it's almost like this like little glass shells around the coffee.  
**[0:38:26-0:38:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:26):**  So it's not doing a whole lot.  
**[0:38:27-0:38:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:27):**  It might keep moisture in the soil, but sure.  
**[0:38:29-0:38:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:29):**  It's a little bit, but it's still organic.  
**[0:38:30-0:38:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:30):**  But it can also wick it off the surface too.  
**[0:38:32-0:38:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:32):**  I've seen it do that for sure.  
**[0:38:34-0:38:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:34):**  And it's kind of just slow to break down.  
**[0:38:36-0:38:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:36):**  It's just not really a high value product on its own.  
**[0:38:42-0:38:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:42):**  So we just, we're like, give us as much as you can get over here.  
**[0:38:46-0:38:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:46):**  You know, anytime you come over, please bring a bag.  
**[0:38:48-0:38:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:48):**  And so now we have loads of it and we're just using it.  
**[0:38:51-0:38:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:51):**  Anytime we get a chicken from Shad or we kill a duck or something like that, toss it right  
**[0:38:57-0:38:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:57):**  in there.  
**[0:38:58-0:39:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:58):**  Cause it means we get to make biochar and we get to use a lot of the scrap wood from  
**[0:39:02-0:39:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:02):**  our construction to heat what we call the retort or the container that you put the biochar  
**[0:39:08-0:39:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:08):**  material in.  
**[0:39:09-0:39:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:09):**  So you have the sort of tin vessel or whatever it's made out of steel vessel that's oxygen  
**[0:39:16-0:39:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:16):**  can't get into, but heat can conduct into it.  
**[0:39:19-0:39:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:19):**  So basically you bake...  
**[0:39:20-0:39:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:20):**  And oxygen can escape from it actually.  
**[0:39:22-0:39:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:22):**  Yeah, you do need a, well, gases, not, not, yeah, yeah, it needs to vent.  
**[0:39:28-0:39:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:28):**  There's all sorts of organic gases that come out of it, which are not good for the atmosphere  
**[0:39:32-0:39:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:32):**  they're like intense greenhouse gases and they're flammable.  
**[0:39:37-0:39:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:37):**  So the trick with biochar is that you send the gases back into the heating element or  
**[0:39:42-0:39:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:42):**  the stove underneath so it can burn off and actually heat itself.  
**[0:39:46-0:39:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:46):**  And once these guys get kicking, ours is very inefficient by the way, it's like we don't  
**[0:39:50-0:39:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:50):**  even have that step down right now, unfortunately.  
**[0:39:52-0:39:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:52):**  I'd like to get that working, but where we have to get a welder in there and start...  
**[0:39:56-0:39:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:56):**  I'll just interrupt for a sec.  
**[0:39:58-0:40:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:58):**  Just like being very humble here, this is actually like arguably my favorite design  
**[0:40:04-0:40:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:04):**  feature on our farm because it's like...  
**[0:40:05-0:40:09](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:05):**  Oh sure, because of the other biochar furnaces, you don't get to smoke birds.  
**[0:40:09-0:40:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:09):**  And by putting the technique Jare came up with of just really having a fire pit where  
**[0:40:15-0:40:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:15):**  we burn our waste construction material, putting a drum over the top of it that has a door  
**[0:40:21-0:40:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:21):**  and a rack where the chicken can go up on top of the rack and the coffee shells go down  
**[0:40:25-0:40:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:25):**  onto the bottom, it creates this kind of insulating effect.  
**[0:40:28-0:40:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:28):**  So the chicken like cooks in really slowly.  
**[0:40:32-0:40:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:32):**  And then to stop the biochar going too far, Jare puts in a little bit of water, what at  
**[0:40:36-0:40:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:36):**  about the three quarter of a mile.  
**[0:40:38-0:40:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:38):**  Yeah, exactly.  
**[0:40:39-0:40:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:39):**  And that water just kind of goes in and it means the chicken sort of plumps up.  
**[0:40:42-0:40:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:42):**  So you get this actually quite smoke steam.  
**[0:40:46-0:40:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:46):**  Yeah, smokey steam.  
**[0:40:47-0:40:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:47):**  You take a smokey steamed chicken and he always marinates it before and then it just comes  
**[0:40:52-0:40:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:52):**  out amazing.  
**[0:40:53-0:40:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:53):**  So it's amazing, so it's almost, it would be worth lighting that amount of wood just  
**[0:40:57-0:40:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:57):**  to produce a chicken of this quality.  
**[0:40:59-0:41:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:59):**  And the fact that you get this amazing soil amendment as well, I think it's like, it's  
**[0:41:04-0:41:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:04):**  a beautiful system and I really liked it.  
**[0:41:06-0:41:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:06):**  He just did it without spending any money playing.  
**[0:41:10-0:41:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:10):**  It was a drum that we'd already had.  
**[0:41:12-0:41:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:12):**  Yeah, we had tried it before for a while.  
**[0:41:14-0:41:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:14):**  We tried to build an oven.  
**[0:41:15-0:41:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:15):**  Yeah, yeah, we used it for so many things.  
**[0:41:17-0:41:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:17):**  And I had one of those like wake up in the middle of the night moments.  
**[0:41:20-0:41:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:20):**  I was like, whoa, wait a minute.  
**[0:41:22-0:41:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:22):**  What are we doing?  
**[0:41:24-0:41:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:24):**  Let's use this tin barrel or whatever steel barrel.  
**[0:41:27-0:41:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:27):**  Okay, so talk to me now about how you in with soil amendments because it's not something  
**[0:41:32-0:41:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:32):**  you can just throw on top of your garden beds, right?  
**[0:41:34-0:41:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:34):**  Yeah, good point.  
**[0:41:36-0:41:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:36):**  So after it's been cooked down and it's in this really fine texture, we consider that  
**[0:41:42-0:41:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:42):**  activated charcoal.  
**[0:41:44-0:41:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:44):**  It's activated in the sense that it's ready to receive or pull in loads of nutrients and  
**[0:41:51-0:41:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:51):**  solution, anything, even parasites and other stuff like that.  
**[0:41:54-0:41:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:54):**  That's why Neil is so psyched about giving it to the goats because it will just suck  
**[0:41:58-0:42:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:58):**  them right out of its stomach lining and pull it down through and out of the animal system.  
**[0:42:04-0:42:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:04):**  And same for humans, I could use this stuff if I needed to.  
**[0:42:06-0:42:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:06):**  I'd use it when I had parasites.  
**[0:42:08-0:42:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:08):**  Yeah, again, it's a really good way of rendering them inactive and clearing your system out.  
**[0:42:12-0:42:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:12):**  Yeah, I'm gonna like, one of our guys has got a bad case I got right now, Miguel actually.  
**[0:42:18-0:42:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:18):**  I'm gonna like slip some in his food later and not tell him.  
**[0:42:20-0:42:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:20):**  I'm just kidding.  
**[0:42:21-0:42:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:21):**  Yeah, he'll be really surprised when his poop all comes out black.  
**[0:42:24-0:42:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:24):**  Yeah, no, just kidding.  
**[0:42:25-0:42:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:25):**  He'll probably take it anyways.  
**[0:42:28-0:42:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:28):**  But it's great for all that stuff.  
**[0:42:29-0:42:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:29):**  It has so many uses, you clean water with it, whatever, if you want it to.  
**[0:42:33-0:42:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:33):**  And we don't produce a lot of it, so I like that we're using it for these specific concentrated  
**[0:42:39-0:42:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:39):**  uses.  
**[0:42:40-0:42:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:40):**  And all the extra biochar goes into our worm production system.  
**[0:42:46-0:42:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:46):**  We were adding it to our animal house system, but it was almost like a drop in the bucket.  
**[0:42:51-0:42:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:51):**  Yeah, drop in the ocean.  
**[0:42:52-0:42:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:52):**  It was like, all right, so it's in there.  
**[0:42:54-0:42:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:54):**  Maybe like, I'm not sure how much compared to...  
**[0:42:56-0:42:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:56):**  Half a gallon bucket into a hundred chicken house.  
**[0:42:59-0:43:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:59):**  It's like...  
**[0:43:00-0:43:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:00):**  Not a whole, not saying a whole lot.  
**[0:43:03-0:43:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:03):**  But if you put it into your worm compost and you have them, the juices from the worms soaking  
**[0:43:07-0:43:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:07):**  in constantly, you have a really fine, really like high-end product basically.  
**[0:43:13-0:43:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:13):**  And the worms would also pass, the worms would eat it and excrete it out as well.  
**[0:43:18-0:43:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:18):**  And then it becomes charged or inoculated immediately when the worms work through it.  
**[0:43:24-0:43:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:24):**  And so what that means is now it's ready to go in your garden and it's going to have all  
**[0:43:28-0:43:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:28):**  these amazing effects.  
**[0:43:29-0:43:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:29):**  It's going to hold onto the nutrients.  
**[0:43:31-0:43:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:31):**  It gives it to the plants easier because we mentioned the microbes need to be present  
**[0:43:37-0:43:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:37):**  for the plants to receive a lot of these minerals and they're in the biochar.  
**[0:43:41-0:43:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:41):**  They're being received from the worms or whatever other sort of active compost that you have  
**[0:43:45-0:43:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:45):**  it mixed into.  
**[0:43:48-0:43:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:48):**  So it actually...  
**[0:43:49-0:43:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:49):**  And it will...  
**[0:43:50-0:43:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:50):**  It's important to realize that I think because it will, otherwise, if you just put it straight  
**[0:43:54-0:43:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:54):**  on your soil, it will actually, it will charge itself in your soil.  
**[0:43:58-0:44:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:58):**  Sort of leech the nutrients out of the soil.  
**[0:44:00-0:44:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:00):**  Not leech, it would pull them away from the plants.  
**[0:44:03-0:44:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:03):**  It would out-compete your plants.  
**[0:44:05-0:44:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:05):**  So it will actually...  
**[0:44:06-0:44:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:06):**  I've heard cases of it actually when it's added on-charge to gardens or farms that it  
**[0:44:12-0:44:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:12):**  has like a negative result on yield.  
**[0:44:15-0:44:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:15):**  It could take years for this stuff to build up if you don't.  
**[0:44:17-0:44:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:17):**  That's what happened to me the first time I made it when I was over in EMAP.  
**[0:44:20-0:44:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:20):**  I made a bunch of it out of corn stalks and they added it as mulch to the garden and all  
**[0:44:27-0:44:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:27):**  the plants just shriveled up and got kind of yellow because it was actually robbing  
**[0:44:31-0:44:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:31):**  nitrogen from the plants.  
**[0:44:35-0:44:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:35):**  What kind of concentrations are we talking about here?  
**[0:44:37-0:44:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:37):**  How much biochar would you ideally add to a really well-charged fertile soil system  
**[0:44:45-0:44:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:45):**  for a market garden?  
**[0:44:46-0:44:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:46):**  As much as you possibly can.  
**[0:44:47-0:44:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:47):**  It's like you can't add too much but you really...  
**[0:44:49-0:44:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:49):**  Recharge.  
**[0:44:50-0:44:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:50):**  Yeah.  
**[0:44:51-0:44:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:51):**  As long as it's inoculated, you could really just...  
**[0:44:54-0:44:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:54):**  I guess I would add it in small amounts.  
**[0:44:58-0:45:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:58):**  What I like to do now is what I'm thinking is like put it in our nursery, into the plants  
**[0:45:02-0:45:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:02):**  we're going to put into the ground so that they're there with them from the start because  
**[0:45:06-0:45:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:06):**  that's where plants need it most especially is when they're like growing and putting it  
**[0:45:10-0:45:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:10):**  deep in your garden is really nice because if you have it at the bottom of a say a planting  
**[0:45:15-0:45:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:15):**  area, all the nutrients that would leach out during the rainy season for instance will  
**[0:45:20-0:45:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:20):**  get trapped down there by the stuff.  
**[0:45:23-0:45:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:23):**  So you think about the most effective use of it I guess because you never make that  
**[0:45:27-0:45:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:27):**  much.  
**[0:45:28-0:45:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:28):**  The only people that make a really lot of it have a big system that they're working  
**[0:45:31-0:45:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:31):**  on and it's beautiful.  
**[0:45:33-0:45:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:33):**  It's a byproduct and they use the heat for something.  
**[0:45:36-0:45:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:36):**  We're using it for chickens but we have a friend Klaus who uses rice hulls and he cooks  
**[0:45:44-0:45:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:44):**  the rice hulls to make the biochar and the heat works as a kiln or works in a kiln to  
**[0:45:48-0:45:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:48):**  dry wood.  
**[0:45:50-0:45:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:50):**  He stores and processes lumber.  
**[0:45:51-0:45:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:51):**  You want to use energy as many times as possible before you can't reclaim it, right?  
**[0:45:55-0:45:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:55):**  And that's more important on a larger scale.  
**[0:45:57-0:46:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:57):**  For our scale, we wouldn't try to set up some elaborate kiln drying system if we were just  
**[0:46:02-0:46:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:02):**  gonna use it every once in a while.  
**[0:46:04-0:46:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:04):**  We might maybe if we could get like a weekly rotisserie smoked chicken at the Atlantic  
**[0:46:12-0:46:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:12):**  stay going, maybe we could do like...  
**[0:46:15-0:46:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:15):**  Make a dehydrator connected to it.  
**[0:46:17-0:46:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:17):**  I'm still super excited about the idea of making a sauna that churns out biochar.  
**[0:46:23-0:46:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:23):**  I'm still working on this idea.  
**[0:46:25-0:46:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:25):**  I gotta get...  
**[0:46:26-0:46:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:26):**  I gotta get a space to work on that.  
**[0:46:28-0:46:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:28):**  It's like patting that.  
**[0:46:29-0:46:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:29):**  Yeah, and then like maybe it could heat water as a byproduct of the exhaust.  
**[0:46:32-0:46:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:32):**  There's a lot of ways of reclaiming heat.  
**[0:46:35-0:46:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:35):**  But let's switch gears for just a second here.  
**[0:46:38-0:46:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:38):**  I want to talk before we run out of time about some of the new endeavors and how you guys  
**[0:46:42-0:46:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:42):**  are moving forward with your respective farms.  
**[0:46:45-0:46:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:45):**  I know that you have been trying to form an Athy Laut Organics Cooperative.  
**[0:46:50-0:46:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:50):**  Tell us a little bit about where we're at in that process and how working with the local  
**[0:46:55-0:46:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:55):**  community is starting to advance.  
**[0:46:58-0:47:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:58):**  Yeah, let's see.  
**[0:47:00-0:47:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:00):**  So the reality here is there's no real infrastructure to sell into for these small organic products.  
**[0:47:15-0:47:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:15):**  There's not like distributors of them already existing.  
**[0:47:19-0:47:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:19):**  And furthermore, the demand is really high and each individual holding both of international  
**[0:47:26-0:47:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:26):**  people and locals is like not ever enough to satisfy the demand.  
**[0:47:30-0:47:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:30):**  So just part of the reality is that there will always be a larger demand for organic  
**[0:47:34-0:47:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:34):**  food than any one individual person here could satisfy.  
**[0:47:40-0:47:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:40):**  And there's really no way that you can reach that market even though it exists.  
**[0:47:45-0:47:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:45):**  So we're kind of having to figure out all the details of like how do you package these  
**[0:47:52-0:47:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:52):**  things?  
**[0:47:53-0:47:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:53):**  How do you maintain communication with customers?  
**[0:47:56-0:47:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:56):**  How do you distribute them?  
**[0:47:57-0:47:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:57):**  How do you charge for them?  
**[0:47:59-0:48:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:59):**  That whole kind of chain.  
**[0:48:01-0:48:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:01):**  And naturally it works better when you handle more products, of course.  
**[0:48:07-0:48:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:07):**  So yeah, Neil and Jeremy and I have been working for now over a year, we're basically a bit  
**[0:48:15-0:48:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:15):**  of a year ago.  
**[0:48:17-0:48:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:17):**  I decided it was in Hot  
**[0:48:37-0:48:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:37):**  T-Gan.  
**[0:48:38-0:48:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:38):**  And we decided to sell it to them, potentially like kind of like a rent to buy type sort  
**[0:48:41-0:48:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:41):**  of situation.  
**[0:48:43-0:48:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:43):**  And so they took the goats over.  
**[0:48:45-0:48:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:45):**  But in that arrangement, we basically decided to sell under the same label that is Hot T-Gan  
**[0:48:49-0:48:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:49):**  Organics, partly because of the recognition that's around here and it has, you know, kind  
**[0:48:56-0:48:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:56):**  of.  
**[0:48:57-0:48:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:57):**  Well, your operation is a lot more developed at this point.  
**[0:48:59-0:49:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:59):**  Developed and just also the idea that the word organic is in there lends itself to products  
**[0:49:04-0:49:05](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:04):**  that are organic.  
**[0:49:05-0:49:10](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:05):**  And so anyway, basically we now have the two of us working together.  
**[0:49:10-0:49:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:10):**  We've been for many years.  
**[0:49:11-0:49:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:11):**  So we're here at the Bamboo Guesthouse right now.  
**[0:49:14-0:49:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:14):**  Our head chef also has a greenhouse up above where he grows organic tomatoes and chili  
**[0:49:18-0:49:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:18):**  peppers, but also salads that supplement our production.  
**[0:49:23-0:49:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:23):**  So we buy salads from him.  
**[0:49:25-0:49:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:25):**  We have two local egg producers in addition to assistance from Neil and Jeremy.  
**[0:49:31-0:49:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:31):**  And so we have a team of local people as well that are starting to tap into this.  
**[0:49:36-0:49:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:36):**  But really the work before looking for products is figuring out those logistics.  
**[0:49:41-0:49:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:41):**  And so a big step I think we've made in service of this is we now have started to share the  
**[0:49:47-0:49:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:47):**  delivery.  
**[0:49:48-0:49:50](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:48):**  So, so I do that again, it's farm.  
**[0:49:50-0:49:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:50):**  Our farm manager basically communicates with other clients.  
**[0:49:54-0:49:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:54):**  That's like part of our responsibility is taking in all the orders.  
**[0:49:58-0:50:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:58):**  And then we deliver to two different towns twice a week.  
**[0:50:00-0:50:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:00):**  And so now I'll do that organics team takes both.  
**[0:50:03-0:50:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:03):**  I'll do that organics and groundhouse, the key and Jeremy's products to one town.  
**[0:50:08-0:50:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:08):**  And then the other town is covered by groundhouse, the key and Jeremy.  
**[0:50:11-0:50:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:11):**  So the fact that we could basically like dovetail our need for transportation into serving both  
**[0:50:21-0:50:25](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:21):**  of us and having our time of delivering is like a big step in that direction where I  
**[0:50:25-0:50:30](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:25):**  see it could go and maybe Neil or Jeremy, you guys want to add in on this after I would  
**[0:50:30-0:50:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:30):**  like to see the branding continue to improve and the packaging and the presentation in  
**[0:50:36-0:50:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:36):**  the stores and at the restaurants that use our products to continue to improve.  
**[0:50:40-0:50:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:40):**  I'd like to continue to improve the logistics of transport and then thoughtfully add new  
**[0:50:48-0:50:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:48):**  products one by one.  
**[0:50:51-0:50:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:51):**  Yeah.  
**[0:50:52-0:50:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:52):**  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.  
**[0:50:56-0:51:00](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:56):**  I think it's great.  
**[0:51:00-0:51:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:00):**  I think trying to find ways to work symbiotically with alongside each other.  
**[0:51:07-0:51:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:07):**  And I think in some ways it's the basis of good community, you know.  
**[0:51:12-0:51:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:12):**  So definitely so far so good.  
**[0:51:15-0:51:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:15):**  It was a great gesture.  
**[0:51:17-0:51:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:17):**  It was like a real shad giving us a loan of the goats like a year and a year and two or  
**[0:51:26-0:51:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:26):**  three months ago was a huge shot in the arm for our farm and to get goats that were already  
**[0:51:33-0:51:37](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:33):**  producing milk, it was like a huge head start.  
**[0:51:37-0:51:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:37):**  And then, yeah, we put a lot.  
**[0:51:39-0:51:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:39):**  It did take us the guts of the year probably to have really, really consistent consistency  
**[0:51:45-0:51:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:45):**  with our production and products.  
**[0:51:48-0:51:56](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:48):**  So you know, now it's I do kind of feel like proud to be a member of this thing where regularly  
**[0:51:56-0:52:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:56):**  in stores and restaurants all over the lake there's really good high quality chicken,  
**[0:52:01-0:52:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:01):**  eggs, salad, cooking greens, dairy, milk and cheese, you know, like all really good top  
**[0:52:11-0:52:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:11):**  notch products.  
**[0:52:13-0:52:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:13):**  There's loads of other things that both Shad and ourselves have planted and have had plenty  
**[0:52:18-0:52:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:18):**  of experience growing like sweet potatoes, malanga, taro root, turmeric, cheese tomatoes.  
**[0:52:26-0:52:32](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:26):**  These are all like perennial crops basically that well not come out they're not perennial  
**[0:52:32-0:52:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:32):**  but you know sort of easy crops to grow that things just want to grow and lake to grow  
**[0:52:39-0:52:44](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:39):**  here that I would be really excited to look into expanding the thing.  
**[0:52:44-0:52:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:44):**  But Shad's right, it's like there's quite a lot to figure out for each product.  
**[0:52:52-0:52:58](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:52):**  I know that's a topic for another podcast all the intricacies of actually selling and  
**[0:52:58-0:53:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:58):**  distributing your products because as we've talked about so much here and also in other  
**[0:53:02-0:53:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:02):**  interviews I've done it's pretty easy to grow things.  
**[0:53:07-0:53:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:07):**  It's pretty easy to get products out of the ground either through plants or through animals  
**[0:53:11-0:53:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:11):**  but managing the business side of it is a whole other aspect and I definitely look forward  
**[0:53:15-0:53:17](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:15):**  to exploring that more.  
**[0:53:17-0:53:21](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:17):**  I just gave, we're hosting a PDC right now, a permaculture design certification course  
**[0:53:21-0:53:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:21):**  we host a couple of years so if you're listening and interested in coming and learning and  
**[0:53:27-0:53:29](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:27):**  practicing here check us out.  
**[0:53:29-0:53:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:29):**  But we're teaching one right now and this morning was the talk on kind of permaculture  
**[0:53:33-0:53:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:33):**  inspired businesses, triple bottom line businesses, land-based endeavors with an intention to  
**[0:53:40-0:53:46](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:40):**  make something at least to cover the expenses of the totality of the operation.  
**[0:53:46-0:53:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:46):**  And I quoted Joel Saladin who's kind of like my role model in this whole realm of like  
**[0:53:52-0:53:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:52):**  farm business and farm entrepreneurship.  
**[0:53:54-0:54:02](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:54):**  He says even nature rewards even the most feeble attempt at production, like even the  
**[0:54:02-0:54:06](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:02):**  crappiest attempt to grow some food usually grows some food, like nature's pretty sweet  
**[0:54:06-0:54:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:06):**  just like gives you something.  
**[0:54:08-0:54:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:08):**  But the real trick like you just said Oliver is like yeah you're gonna get something before  
**[0:54:13-0:54:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:13):**  you plant it you should know where you're gonna sell it if you have intention of selling  
**[0:54:18-0:54:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:18):**  it.  
**[0:54:19-0:54:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:19):**  Now before we wrap up today can both of you guys, well all three of you guys talk a little  
**[0:54:23-0:54:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:23):**  bit about the things that you have on offer right now because there's a whole range of  
**[0:54:27-0:54:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:27):**  courses and you guys have started a cafe at Gran Jacyquin and Aptitlan Organics is working  
**[0:54:34-0:54:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:34):**  in new realms as well.  
**[0:54:35-0:54:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:35):**  Talk a little bit about where you're headed in the future because I'm really looking forward  
**[0:54:39-0:54:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:39):**  to catching up and doing some follow up on this when I have a chance to come back.  
**[0:54:45-0:54:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:45):**  Yeah I can lead.  
**[0:54:47-0:54:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:47):**  So definitely you know it's an interesting time right now the Aptitlan Organics farm  
**[0:54:54-0:55:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:54):**  and then also Gran Jacyquin and we also have another farm that we work with Big Rock Farm  
**[0:55:01-0:55:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:01):**  which is over in San Marcos.  
**[0:55:03-0:55:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:03):**  The three of us, the three farms and four of us that's including Haley who's not here  
**[0:55:08-0:55:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:08):**  right now, the four of us are also collaborating on the teaching endeavors.  
**[0:55:12-0:55:16](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:12):**  So we're not only looking for like the farm product cooperative but we're starting to  
**[0:55:16-0:55:22](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:16):**  dream up this vision of like what a teacher's cooperative would look like and it would probably  
**[0:55:22-0:55:28](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:22):**  include not just courses both here and abroad but also possibly consulting services and  
**[0:55:28-0:55:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:28):**  other things that maybe Neil and Jeremy will mention a bit more.  
**[0:55:31-0:55:35](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:31):**  But it's the same kind of set of questions how do we work together symbiotically at the  
**[0:55:35-0:55:41](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:35):**  teaching level as well so you know I'm really excited that we now have a team of four solid  
**[0:55:41-0:55:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:41):**  lead facilitators that are teaching intro to permaculture courses and also permaculture  
**[0:55:47-0:55:48](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:47):**  design certification courses.  
**[0:55:48-0:55:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:48):**  So you can find information about all the permaculture trainings on aptitlanorganics.com  
**[0:55:53-0:55:54](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:53):**  you can check all that out.  
**[0:55:54-0:55:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:54):**  Furthermore we have some other cool things going on both at Aptitlan Organics and at  
**[0:55:59-0:56:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:59):**  the Bamboo Guesthouse which is kind of like the farm's guesthouse where we have our farm  
**[0:56:03-0:56:04](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:03):**  and table restaurant.  
**[0:56:04-0:56:12](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:04):**  We have a 200 hour yoga teacher training with a permaculture component with the Waking Spirit  
**[0:56:12-0:56:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:12):**  Yoga in November.

**[0:56:22-0:56:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:22):**  of this area.  
**[0:56:24-0:56:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:24):**  And we also have a permaculture for the herbalist path course that's September 23rd and this  
**[0:56:31-0:56:36](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:31):**  is super exciting this is our first collaboration with Punta Mona in Costa Rica and with the  
**[0:56:36-0:56:43](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:36):**  village witches who do the master herbs stuff and vision festival and also pulling in fungi  
**[0:56:43-0:56:49](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:43):**  academy so that herb course is a four week permaculture and herb mapping the human body  
**[0:56:49-0:56:53](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:49):**  and systems to the whole earth system is going to be really exciting that September.  
**[0:56:53-0:56:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:53):**  So we have a lot of stuff you can check out all our things at Aptitlanorganics.com and  
**[0:56:57-0:57:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:56:57):**  you can also check out BambooGuesthouse.com as well for other listings there.  
**[0:57:03-0:57:07](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:03):**  Awesome and you guys tell me about how Grand Hasekina is moving forward and developing  
**[0:57:07-0:57:11](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:07):**  after about a year and a half of collaboration.  
**[0:57:11-0:57:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:11):**  We have a lot of work to do yet we're rebuilding our animal house we built it as a kind of  
**[0:57:18-0:57:23](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:18):**  a temporary structure and we're sort of building it around doubling down on the things that  
**[0:57:23-0:57:31](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:23):**  we've seen working so we're making it more ample so there's more room for goats and we  
**[0:57:31-0:57:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:31):**  can put more divisions in there and also rebuilding the structure so that it can have a flat deck  
**[0:57:40-0:57:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:40):**  up above where we can have extra space for growing plants and maybe even like a hangout  
**[0:57:45-0:57:51](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:45):**  area but also principally an area to dry coffee in coffee season.  
**[0:57:51-0:57:59](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:51):**  So that's like a big project we're finishing our post farmhouse as well there's quite a  
**[0:57:59-0:58:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:59):**  bit of work to do on that and we have like quite a bit of landscaping to do yet we have  
**[0:58:03-0:58:15](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:03):**  a whole sort of zone two strokes three forest garden wetland that we're like midway through  
**[0:58:15-0:58:18](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:15):**  doing the earthworks on now.  
**[0:58:18-0:58:24](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:18):**  So that's a it's a lot of work it's we're really excited about it and it's a it's a  
**[0:58:24-0:58:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:24):**  great opportunity for long-term volunteer slash like apprenticeship or intern or leadership  
**[0:58:33-0:58:38](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:33):**  kind of programs that we're like looking forward to because like we do have all this really  
**[0:58:38-0:58:42](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:38):**  interesting work going on right now and we're in that sort of like primary implementation  
**[0:58:42-0:58:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:42):**  phase you know so it's it's it's cool in a lot of ways it's it's a lot of work and we're  
**[0:58:47-0:58:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:47):**  happy to open it up to people that are really like gung-ho to like get in on us.  
**[0:58:52-0:58:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:52):**  We're excited about about that kind of like in a way symbiosis between the volunteer program  
**[0:58:57-0:59:03](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:57):**  and the and the teaching program because yeah we really do feel like you know a stint at  
**[0:59:03-0:59:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:03):**  at actually doing the hands-on work of implementing these systems in in conjunction with a course  
**[0:59:08-0:59:13](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:08):**  is is a really I think good way to fast track your learning if you're passionate about this  
**[0:59:13-0:59:20](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:13):**  stuff and then the other thing we're super excited about is is the community reforestation  
**[0:59:20-0:59:27](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:20):**  project it was a great you know shad in a lot of sense that already envisioned this  
**[0:59:27-0:59:34](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:27):**  project and then we spent a lot of time doing the first ones where we started doing week-long  
**[0:59:34-0:59:40](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:34):**  volunteer programs where where people can come learn the basics of agroforestry and  
**[0:59:40-0:59:47](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:40):**  and permaculture but we spend most of the time doing light earthworks and planting trees  
**[0:59:47-0:59:55](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:47):**  on on local people's land which for us is like I guess the culmination of of like probably  
**[0:59:55-1:00:01](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:55):**  between Shaddai and Jeremy maybe like 20 plus years of being Guatemalan and observing this  
**[1:00:01-1:00:08](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:01):**  ecosystem and and realizing that coffee in a lot of ways holds could hold the key to  
**[1:00:08-1:00:14](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:08):**  preserving this ecosystem because it is a shade tolerant forest crop and I'm really  
**[1:00:14-1:00:19](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:14):**  inspired by like this vision of somehow being part of the development of kind of like a  
**[1:00:19-1:00:26](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:19):**  community wide zone three commercial operation we're lucky that we collaborate with Tim who's  
**[1:00:26-1:00:33](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:26):**  a coffee roaster and we're lucky that we we did build up good relations last year about  
**[1:00:33-1:00:39](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:33):**  buying so much coffee from the community and we kind of have now like a list of names of  
**[1:00:39-1:00:45](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:39):**  coffee producers who are very excited to have some soil conservation and and useful shade  
**[1:00:45-1:00:52](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:45):**  trees planted on their land so that's another like endeavor that is is I think we're all  
**[1:00:52-1:00:57](https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:52):**  pretty excited about yeah it's super exciting and before we wrap up I just want to say to
