And just over a month ago at the regenerate conference in Denver, I met Jared Kirst, who in<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:03:16">0:03:16-0:03:44</a>:</strong>  his own words is a recovering sod farmer paying the pennants for all his glyphosate use by  rehabilitating the soil on his farm, focusing on soil health and building a thriving grass-fed beef  business. Well, good morning, Jared Kirst. Welcome to Ranching Reboot. How are you, buddy?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:03:46">0:03:46-0:04:05</a>:</strong>  Morning, Brian. I'm doing pretty good. Thanks for inviting me.  Well, I appreciate you doing this. And this isn't one of our normal ones, is it? You're kind of new  to this whole regenerative stuff, aren't you? Yeah, you know, new because I started the journey<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:31</a>:</strong>  2010 timeframe, but I was a real slow learner, Brian. It took a long time. My first attempt out  of the gate at soil health, rejuvenation was probably the word I would have used at the time,  started with Roundup Ready Alfalfa. You know, I told you I was a sod farmer, turf grass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:04:32">0:04:32-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  Right.  And that's real extractive.  I think we're going to have to get back to how rejuvenating the land with Roundup Ready Alfalfa,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:05:04</a>:</strong>  how that kind of squared, but go on.  Yeah. So, you know, I actually got into farming in general from sort of non-farming side. I  graduated from college with a business degree and flaunted around and became the office manager at<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:05:04">0:05:04-0:05:25</a>:</strong>  this sod farm in Glenwood Springs. And there was a farm manager at the time who was a part owner  in the whole operation had been started by a doctor and his wife. The wife was actually the  business owner manager and it was a funding mechanism for their nonprofit hospital in Mexico.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:05:25">0:05:25-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  And they had started growing sod with the concept of maximizing per acre per acre yield, essentially.  So they could fund their hospital in Mexico with the profit.  Correct. Nonprofit Mission Hospital, which gave me kind of this<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:05:46">0:05:46-0:06:06</a>:</strong>  in with the nonprofit and the idea that it was not just greed that I was going after. Very idealistic.  I was out of college, but I slipped pretty quickly into recognizing that, yeah, there was  money to be made in sod, but we only had 130 acres or so of irreparable ground on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:06:06">0:06:06-0:06:29</a>:</strong>  Okay. The rest was sagebrush. Where are you? So we're in between Glenwood Springs and Carpino,  Colorado up in the mountains. The farm is 7,000 feet in elevation, which presents its own unique  challenges and opportunities like anything. And the water is really good. Spring water year round<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:06:29">0:06:29-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  fed produces most of the water for the farm. Okay. So we were in this little niche close to Vail and  Aspen. That was the market for the sod. Now we're trying to make it the market for grass-finished  beef, but that's the situation we find ourselves in. And when we tried to expand the business,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:06:54">0:06:54-0:07:17</a>:</strong>  the only thing we could do is add on sales because the acres were limited. So Macy, the owner had  started a distribution business selling landscape supplies, fertilizer, seed chemicals. Ironically,  lots of chemicals and fertilizer. To go with the sod, we sold some farmers and ranchers in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:07:17">0:07:17-0:07:40</a>:</strong>  area, but largely landscape, right? What I call aesthetic agriculture on that side. Right.  We were selling as much sod as we could sell. And I was only a farmer in the sense that I was  ordering fertilizer, directing seed and planting. Once the farm manager had left,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:07:40">0:07:40-0:08:03</a>:</strong>  I took over general manager of the place in about 2001. And the owners left also to go  down to Mexico to run their hospital. So I was sort of left to grow the business and manage it.  And during that period, the lead up to the peak of business in 2007, right? The right before the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:08:03">0:08:03-0:08:28</a>:</strong>  crash market, we were selling a lot of sod. Out of the 130 acres that I had in production at the time,  we would put onto a pallet, a rolled up piece of sod on a pallet of about 77 acres of sod,  which was pushing it. We were dumping NPK on the fields.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:46</a>:</strong>  Okay. 77 acres to make one pallet of sod? Did I hear that right?  No, no. 77 acres worth of sod got put onto pallets. That's thousands of pallets. There's  only 400 square feet. There's roughly a hundred pallets to an acre.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:08:46">0:08:46-0:09:10</a>:</strong>  How many pallets to an acre? About a hundred.  Okay. Okay. And this is cutting the roots and a little bit of soil off each time.  And we come back in with fertilizer and seed and aeration, physical penetrative aeration in order<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:09:10">0:09:10-0:09:32</a>:</strong>  to fix the soil problems and compaction. And what we were finding is that it was becoming  exceedingly expensive to grow every consecutive square foot on that same area. Of course,  because of the funding requirements, there was no fallow. There was no rotation. It was sod on sod.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:09:32">0:09:32-0:09:47</a>:</strong>  Right. Maximize profit.  Maximize profit at all costs.  Yeah. And what I realized about the crash in 2000, you know, in 2007, the markets in<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:09:47">0:09:47-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  Denver started to implode, but the wealth in Vail and Aspen delays that in our market. And so 2008  was also very strong. In order to get all of that cash out of the sod, we were really extracting it  from the soil. This is the bottom line. And the hubris of the sod farmer is that it's just<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:30</a>:</strong>  chemistry. It's just a growing media that is, and we can grow anything. We can grow sod on concrete,  Brian. You know, that's what I would tell you. I would say that that attitude, that mindset,  that we're treating our soil just like a growing medium and hauling all the inputs to it to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:10:30">0:10:30-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  it grow that we think that it needs. That's not just sod farming, Jared. I think that's  farming in general. And it's gotten worse in the last two decades.  That ability, that hubris to believe that we can control it was really deeply set in me. I had<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:11:14</a>:</strong>  learned the greens industry from a golf course mentality, not from a farming, even though all  of my family were homesteaders, essentially in Eastern Colorado, farming and ranching.  And so I was around, I guess traditional is what we called it from the time I was growing up,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  but it was also NPK farming, row crop, monoculture, same concept. At least there,  they would rotate between wheat and corn and flowers or something.  It wasn't a typical corn soybean rotation. I wasn't familiar with that, but it was the same<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:11:35">0:11:35-0:11:57</a>:</strong>  kind of mentality and I was real stuck in it. So that's what led to when I recognized how much it  was costing to produce a role of a square foot, which is how we do it or acres or whatever. It was  really getting expensive. Partly I realized now is because the soil was so degraded that the biology<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:11:57">0:11:57-0:12:24</a>:</strong>  was completely gone and we were trying to run a chemical system. And there were abiotic issues,  there were pathogenic, biotic issues showing up. There was all these things. And so I started  researching how to fix it. I had actually been given a book by Joel Salatin called You Can Farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:12:24">0:12:24-0:12:44</a>:</strong>  And I looked at that and I said, well, this has nothing to do with us. And I tossed it on the  shelf around that timeframe, around 2009. And I said, well, alpha is a league. I've heard of this.  It pumps nitrogen and it has a root system that will fix this soil. So I get out there and I order<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:12:44">0:12:44-0:13:03</a>:</strong>  up the Roundup ready. I had to register. I should have known at the time there was something crazy  if you have to register with the state or the government to get a permit to put this in. But  I put in a monoculture of alfalfa over the top of this ground in areas where I just couldn't grow<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:13:03">0:13:03-0:13:22</a>:</strong>  sod realistically anymore. And I knew we were going to take a big hit financially, but it was  also coming on the heels of that recession. So demand dropped and we were relying then on that  distribution business, selling chemicals and fertilizers to the maintenance contractors to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:13:22">0:13:22-0:13:46</a>:</strong>  stay in business. Well, as the business, we had also had to shrink contract and also we contracted  too slowly. So I had had 20 some employees at the peak and I was reluctant to let them go because  it's hard to find people always here in these mountain communities. And that was a slow addition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  2010, we actually had the first and only year of losses, financial losses in that business. And the  owners living in Mexico and Texas at the time said, we don't like this very much obviously.  They had been used to making revenue. And probably a lot of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:28</a>:</strong>  And they didn't like the light at times. Yeah, like in the 2007, 2008 era, it was starting to  pour in. But I realized we were sort of reaping what we sowed. We had also crashed our ecosystem  and it had crashed about the same time that the economy hit. That same kind of,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:14:30">0:14:30-0:14:53</a>:</strong>  really it's very similar I guess to when the Lehman Brothers crashed, my fields started crashing.  And I was learning on the side some things by a few people at these farm and I was going to,  I went to an Acres Conference, that organic farming conference,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:14:54">0:14:54-0:15:10</a>:</strong>  you know, a bunch of Amish people there, which is my first exposure to that.  Acres is a Acres Conference is pretty cool. I've never been. And as we're recording this,  I think it's actually going on right now. It is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:15:10">0:15:10-0:15:32</a>:</strong>  It is. You mentioned Joel Salatin and your journey started with one of his books.  It's kind of funny. Just a couple of days ago, somebody was talking about him and I was looking  at my recording schedule and I had a hole. And I said, well, why don't I just email Joel Salatin?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:15:32">0:15:32-0:15:48</a>:</strong>  Let's just throw a hook out there and see what comes back. Let's see what bites. And he bid on  it. And within three hours, we're scheduled for an interview, which is going to happen in a couple  of weeks. So for all y'all podcast fans in two weeks, if everything goes good, will be Joel<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:15:48">0:15:48-0:16:12</a>:</strong>  Salatin the week after Christmas. I think that's right. Yeah. First episode of 2022 should be Joel  Salatin. There you go. And I went and took a class from him in Denver in person. They do those  classes through the Stockman Grammar that he now edits, which was again, the Stockman Grass Farmer<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:16:12">0:16:12-0:16:31</a>:</strong>  was given to me by my uncle, who's still ranching and farming on all of the family ground in eastern  Colorado. And that many years did you get the Stockman Grass Farmer before it started to sink in?  It was probably two or three. And it was probably what led me to all of these things. Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:16:31">0:16:31-0:16:54</a>:</strong>  I was growing alfalfa. And for a few years, that alfalfa, it's so pretty, the crop, you know,  and it did thrive. It was obviously chemically reaching down and getting some of those phosphate  stores that I had been dumping on the fields, producing its own nitrogen, and really,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:16:54">0:16:54-0:17:11</a>:</strong>  and I was at the time, just having it hayed by the neighbors. And, you know, in theory, they were,  the idea was they were going to take half the hay for the fee, and then the other half they would  take and then we would trade the value of that. And I started talking about bringing in cattle<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:17:11">0:17:11-0:17:28</a>:</strong>  at some point. And they're a cow calf operation. They run about 300 head, a cow calf operation. And  so it just made sense. I didn't really know what I was doing at the time with the with the cattle  idea. I just thought, oh, it'd be good to bring them in because I've got all this stuff to grace.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:17:29">0:17:29-0:17:53</a>:</strong>  But I was in the long run trying to put everything back into sod. So I started going to classes.  That Stockman Grass Farmer has a contributor, Alan Nation, you know, who was the editor at the time.  Was holding a class in Mississippi with Annabel Portomingo. Oh, you know him? Yep, I've heard of<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:17:53">0:17:53-0:18:11</a>:</strong>  him. And he's, he apparently, you know, not everybody agrees with a lot of his assertions.  I'm finding it was, it was an exposure that I had, I was signed up for the class and Alan Nation was  supposed to teach it and he actually died just a week or two before the class. And so I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:18:11">0:18:11-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  was was stuck teaching the whole thing. And Alan's wife was there to sort of help and support the  thing. But I sat in that class, you know, actually, with her to the Alexander dairy family from  Northern California, I have not, but they're doing they're doing that regenerative, certified milk,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  and it's now showing up all over the country. And so I was there and I was there and I was  like, Oh, well, I'm going to get a certified milk and it's now showing up all over the country.  And you said that was Alexander dairy in Northern California,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:18:51</a>:</strong>  and they're selling regenerative milk?  The Alexander family.  All right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:18:51">0:18:51-0:19:10</a>:</strong>  Yes, they're an amazing family. Yeah, you know, they're, they're really progressive folks.  Blake and his wife are, and he and his daughter were there at this grass finishing class,  and I thought he was just going to teach me because I'm a grass farmer, oh, just plant this<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:19:10">0:19:10-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  and that and the other thing and you would produce excellent beef. It's obviously a little more  complicated than that. But it was one of my introductions. And then I went to another  acres conference. And that it is when it really started clicking, because I was walking down the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:49</a>:</strong>  hallway, Brian, and I heard this guy talking, just his voice talking about taste buds. And people  and I was like, What is that about? You know, there's some kooky stuff at those.  And I, I step into the classroom and there's Fred Provenza telling me about how the connection from<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:19:49">0:19:49-0:20:10</a>:</strong>  the soil to my tongue. And this what he calls the wisdom body changed my whole life. It really did,  it gave me the why in that next 30 minutes. It was starting to light bulbs going off about  why the soil at my farm, for example, didn't smell good. I could just, I could just start seeing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:20:10">0:20:10-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  cascade of these issues. And so I introduced myself to Fred. And it's, he lived in Colorado  at the time and started this friendship. And he's been just an absolute mentor to me. And I mean,  he gave me the why, as to what am I searching for? What am I trying to do? Am I, am I healing<br />

And that was in the timeframe, you know, leading up to  I had just bought the business from the owners. They didn't want it anymore,  because the liability. And so obviously gave me an opportunity to buy it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:21:04</a>:</strong>  What year was that? I'm just trying to keep my timeline straight.  2012 is when we agreed, right? Because we had had the loss, we started turning it around,  we had the loss in 2010. So we started the discussion in 2011. And by 2013, we closed on it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:21:04">0:21:04-0:21:22</a>:</strong>  and I had a contract on the land. This the farm itself is 182 acres out of this larger development,  you know, it's literally, it's got development homes planned across the road.  Do you have a farm inside of like a subdivision? Is that what you're telling me?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:21:24">0:21:24-0:21:42</a>:</strong>  It doesn't feel like that. But it could end up there pretty close, right? There's a we are real,  real close to our neighbors with Colorado Mountain College, which is a community college that was  actually started by people that were donated land from the founders of my farm, the homesteaders of<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:21:42">0:21:42-0:21:59</a>:</strong>  this farm, and the neighbors, they donated the land to this company. Now, they're my neighbors.  Okay. Which is, you know, it's a great relationship for working on there.  But behind me, there's a 6000 acre parcel that's a neighbor on one side, and it's leased by my<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:21:59">0:21:59-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  neighbors for the cow calf. It's, you know, scheduled in theory to have 600 houses in a  couple golf courses. So that's the kind of pressure we're sort of surrounded by and the  neighboring property across my street from me is only 90 some houses or something. So we'll see.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:22:19">0:22:19-0:22:39</a>:</strong>  That is the context in which I find myself. So the Berkleys, the owners sold it to me.  And in 2012, I also had my first daughter, which Brian is, I don't want to underestimate how  much of a change I think that it like softened my tissue, more of these ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:22:39">0:22:39-0:22:59</a>:</strong>  Okay. And so that 2014 timeframe, the two hour, two years, I was learning, really busy,  trying to save the distribution business. And, you know, I had pulled most of the sod acreage  out of production. During that timeframe, we were only running on maybe 1520 acres at the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:23:00">0:23:00-0:23:20</a>:</strong>  And also, at that time, our demographic shifted, you know, we were running largely on immigrant  labor, right, traditional Mexican green card, labor, and that dried up with that recession,  you know, over the next few years, those folks just quit coming or if they came back,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:23:20">0:23:20-0:23:41</a>:</strong>  they were headed to Aspen for $25 an hour, right, framing houses. And so we started scrambling and  ended up, you know, hiring mostly local folks, young folks, and very transitory positions,  seasonal, you know, they'd work one year, and that was about it. So I ended up doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:23:42">0:23:42-0:24:00</a>:</strong>  most of the farming myself, you know, instead of being the sort of gentleman intellectual farmer,  just telling them what it was, I was ended up doing all of the spraying and the fertilizing and  the seeding. Well, and it woke up in me something that was just dormant, I think, in my, in my<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:24:00">0:24:00-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  ancestry, was that I really enjoy that a lot, that connection with the soil. But it was still  pretty sick. I mean, the farm was was sick. And I'll say that the soils degraded, you know,  and you could see satellite imagery where it's just, there's no color, there's no photosetic<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:34</a>:</strong>  capacity for a large part of the year in many of these places, the weeds were, and we call them  weeds, and we're talking everything under the sun, napweed, thistles of any sort, everywhere.  And my infrastructure was really old, you know, some of the diesel pump sets were getting 30<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:24:34">0:24:34-0:24:53</a>:</strong>  years old. So I started dumping money on them, you know, trying to bring this back, you know,  if I was going to buy this land, and I was gonna leave any land, whether it's my children or  otherwise, that started changing all those philosophies. And of course, the word regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:24:53">0:24:53-0:25:08</a>:</strong>  started getting thrown around, about the time that it started pinging around in my brain.  And with Fred Provenza, then he ended up writing that book Nourishment that you know about,  it's become like, I give it to everybody, you know, it's that kind of thing to me, but I also<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:25:09">0:25:09-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  simultaneously started reading more of all of these things. You know, Alan Savory and the  whole management became another complete game changer for me. And the philosophical  philosophical side of it, Brian was, you know, people like Wendell Berry, and that Masanobu<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:42</a>:</strong>  Fukuoka, yeah, one straw revolution.  I can't, I can't get his name either. But yeah, one straw, one straw Fukunoba guy.  Yeah, the one, the do nothing farming guy, like, you know, simple, interesting book translated,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:25:42">0:25:42-0:26:03</a>:</strong>  but just, again, all these cracks into my, my existing preconceived notion. And, you know,  it took a while, but now I am, I have fully drunk the Kool-Aid, you know, and I listen to you and  people in our space, I became also trying to engage with community, which is something that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:26:03">0:26:03-0:26:21</a>:</strong>  sod farmers only did, you know, at high end resorts once a year with their association, right.  And that, that didn't work out for me. But I started engaging my local farming community.  That changed a lot. I started going to the Rocky Mountain Farmers Union stuff and meeting people<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:26:21">0:26:21-0:26:40</a>:</strong>  that care. And I realized that I needed to expand my world, not be so self focused, if you will.  And it's been, it's been really good to do that. But then it's challenged a lot of things.  But I started running into this problem like that I think you run into is that I start saying,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:26:40">0:26:40-0:26:54</a>:</strong>  yeah, we're all one big farming family. And I started to think, well,  we're all one big farming family. But I don't have to, even though there's a lot of pressure to,  I don't have to agree that we're doing things okay. And that it's okay that everybody's still<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:26:54">0:26:54-0:27:12</a>:</strong>  running massive feedlots.  Yeah, I, you know, participating, participating in the current system, because that's the way it is,  doesn't make us complicit in its creation. But it also shouldn't prevent us from trying to build a<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:27:12">0:27:12-0:27:32</a>:</strong>  better system or doing something better. And like, you've got the can opener on a couple can of worms  right now that are kind of, that are kind of interesting. Like, you know, well, a month ago,  we were out of Denver for Regenerate. And one of the things they were talking about was,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:27:35">0:27:35-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  you know, that the redistribution of land and that, you know, the thought that you'll own  nothing and be happy and that we need to, we need to really look at this model of that, you know,  the, what that one guy said on the last day, the that lawyer in his presentation, it was like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:28:10</a>:</strong>  tell a president from California, didn't he say something like, we need to demolish the pillar of  private property ownership in this country in order to transform agriculture, scares the hell  out of me. I mean, it does. And that's not where I intended to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:28:10">0:28:10-0:28:29</a>:</strong>  I know what I was thinking of is, you know, these cans of worms that, you know, yeah, there are  problems with the current system. There's a lot of problems of the current system that we're not  really willing to take a honest look at and ask some questions like, why do we need to do this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:28:29">0:28:29-0:28:50</a>:</strong>  Is this really the best thing long term for animal health? Like, well, the big thing that's going  around lately is they're talking about restricting all livestock antibiotics, need a prescription in  2023. I'm okay with that. That doesn't bother me, because out of my relatively few animals in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:28:50">0:28:50-0:29:10</a>:</strong>  scope of the entire beef production chain, I'm not going to have to doctor that many because I have  a healthy pasture, I have a healthy system, and I've got good cattle. Now, the people that are  trying to defend the current system and say that we need to keep it going, that, you know, these<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:29:10">0:29:10-0:29:29</a>:</strong>  antibiotics are critical for animal health and welfare. They're the same people that are injecting  80 plus percent of cattle that show up at a feedlot with antibiotics when they get off the truck  to prevent disease. And, okay, so from one point of view, that's a viable strategy. We can't let<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:29:29">0:29:29-0:29:44</a>:</strong>  disease get in our 100,000 head feedlot where they're all packed in like sardines, and there's  no natural immunity. We can't let any pathogens get in there. So we have to nuke everything to  reduce so there's no possibility of a pathogen, then everything's safe, right? It doesn't work<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:29:44">0:29:44-0:30:04</a>:</strong>  like that. It doesn't work like that. Because nature finds a way around all of our antibiotics.  She finds a way around all our herbicides, our pesticides, our insecticides. She always does. She  always has. And she'll keep doing it. The only thing we can do is try to invent stronger and more<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:30:04">0:30:04-0:30:25</a>:</strong>  lethal toxins, which the stronger and more lethal the toxins get that we spray on our food and that  we feed to our food. I think it's fallacy to think. It's fallacy to believe that long term,  the chemicals that we spray on our food have no effect on the human body<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:30:26">0:30:26-0:30:47</a>:</strong>  and human health. I just think it's absolutely absurd to think that all the chemicals that we  use in food production have no effect on human health. It is possible, I will grant, that some  of those things may not have a huge negative effect. But the problem is you don't know<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:30:47">0:30:47-0:31:08</a>:</strong>  PFAS, that forever chemical class, you hear about it showing up in compost. And we're only just  scratching the surface of that problem because nobody's tested in most of the country yet.  But again, it was presumed safe without, it's like this with everything, the consequences<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:31:09">0:31:09-0:31:27</a>:</strong>  of ignoring the potential and just assuming that it'll be okay could be catastrophic. Now,  it's one of the issues, everything you talked about, Brian, is absolutely true. Us trying to  control and subdue nature, and by that I mean the pathogens we're talking about in this case,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:31:28">0:31:28-0:31:47</a>:</strong>  and if you look everywhere, you mentioned sardines, they are dumping antibiotics into  salmon farms again. And they're finding that they have to. It is repeated and repeated throughout  every human system, whether it is on the slaughter floor at the slaughterhouses, the sterilization,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:31:48">0:31:48-0:32:06</a>:</strong>  they're trying to sterilize everything. And then that is where in those giant plants that  these recalls are coming from. And it's in hospitals that you find all of the worst  antibiotic resistant pathogens because they have to coat everything in antibiotics. So you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:32:06">0:32:06-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  absolutely right. And that all of these philosophical people I was talking to you about,  the concept is the same. No matter what avenue we're talking about is every time we humans try  to separate ourselves and say, no, we know better than the natural system, whether you call it<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:50</a>:</strong>  creation or evolutionary biology, I don't care. The system is really good at what it does.  And every time we think we know better, every time I've never seen a time we don't get it wrong.  So that was me having to look at myself and what I did, extracting all of that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:33:13</a>:</strong>  ecosystem brilliance out of the land and turning it into calf was what I was doing. And so trying  to get back there, I also kept falling into the same kind of thing. Well, I can do this,  I'll fix it with chemicals and inputs. It's still very hard, Brian, to back off. But I will tell you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:33:13">0:33:13-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  a little anecdote about how I got out of that. I have a center pivot, a small pivot, 26-acre pivot  there. And it's on the side of a mountain. And the bottom part of it is down in a lowland area  heading towards the wetlands. And I had lost a bunch of sod production in that lowland<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:34:00</a>:</strong>  due to soil saturated with water. Right, wouldn't drain. Right. Well, and I literally  spent much money and time tiling. I drenched, put in drain tiles, poured in gravel  and fabric into my soil. Drain tiling to me is something that's just,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:22</a>:</strong>  it's a foreign concept. Like, we're going to go in and put a pipe eight feet in the ground  to take excess water out because it's too wet to grow crops. Like that makes no sense to me  in my context at all. Okay, but that is your brain has gotten to a place where it sees that I was,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:34:22">0:34:22-0:34:37</a>:</strong>  oh, that's simple. You know, you have too much water, put a little pole in the bottom of that  and drain it right away. It makes sense. And they're doing it all over the country. I was  wrong. There's no question. So I said, okay, now that it's dried up, let me plant some alfalfa<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:34:37">0:34:37-0:34:55</a>:</strong>  that soil. So I put the alfalfa in. Well, the drain tile didn't always work. We have a lot of  clay soils. They seal up pretty fast. The floods came in and took out my alfalfa. And I was giving  up. I was like, this is insane. I had 12 acres of just ruined ground. So I rented a little old<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:34:55">0:34:55-0:35:17</a>:</strong>  pull behind no-till drill from the NRCS. I dumped every weird seed I could think of in that thing.  You know, and I had probably started hearing Gabe's Brown's name at that point, you know,  and this was in 2015, probably 2014. And I walked away from that field. I literally pretended it<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:35:17">0:35:17-0:35:38</a>:</strong>  didn't exist because it was dead to me. I was so angry. I just couldn't believe how bad it  was happening. And today, right, it is my showpiece pasture. It's on my website. Super diverse,  has all kinds of mix of grasses and legumes, little bit of thistles, but every other kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:35:38">0:35:38-0:35:58</a>:</strong>  of fool could think of is in there. And the cattle thrive on it. It grows back super quickly. And the  soils underneath are now structured and black. And guess what? There's no flooding. No, there's  nothing. It's unbelievable how good the water cycle is now. Probably don't need drain tile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:35:59">0:35:59-0:36:14</a>:</strong>  I was gonna say, you probably don't need drain tile to drain that field anymore.  I don't need anything. In fact, it's amazing to me how it stays wet in that perfect zone all the  time. And that is, it's just what everybody talks about in our world, this carbon deal, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:36:14">0:36:14-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  and when we hear those terms about every percent of carbon adds this many gallons to your acres,  whatever, I also resist to some of those things because we're trying to put a number on something  that it varies so much depending on your soil types. Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:52</a>:</strong>  You name it. I mean, if you're in the Sandhills North Ray versus my Clay Mountain, it's not the  same. But organic matter is better no matter what. There's just no question. And that perennial root  system is doing an amazing thing with the fungal hyphae, the mycorrhizal relationships going on<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:36:52">0:36:52-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  there. The bugs, the bugs, Brian, are out of control. And it's become one of the main keys  to my farm now is recognizing the proliferation of biodiversity in insects, in birds. I'm having  such, it's giving me so much drive now. And 10 years ago, when you were still<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:38</a>:</strong>  sod farming and trying to have a little bit of alfalfa, all those bugs and birds and wildlife  would be absolute death for your crop. In fact, I was talking to somebody yesterday,  because I've got my program with my cows and I'm feeding Pro Earth Health,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:37:38">0:37:38-0:37:59</a>:</strong>  Cattle Active Tub, because they're about the only tub that's American Grassfed Association and IMI  certified. So, that's a pretty clean product. And I'm feeding alfalfa. And the question was,  well, what was the alfalfa sprayed with? Is it organic? Is it non-GMO? Like, fuck, I don't know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:38:00">0:38:00-0:38:21</a>:</strong>  Like, it probably not. I'm just gonna say probably not. Even for the price that I had to pay for it  this year, it's probably just regular field run alfalfa, nothing special. It's probably  had everything in the world sprayed on it. And the person I was talking to had this to say about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:38</a>:</strong>  well, you have to spray alfalfa because if you don't, bugs will eat that first cutting.  Yeah, okay. I'm not an alfalfa farmer. Maybe there's truth to that. Maybe there's not. I just,  I keep going back to this thing like having an enterprise to fit your environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:38:38">0:38:38-0:38:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I don't know if you've heard me say that a lot recently, but it's something that I say  pretty often. And it has a tendency to come back up a lot more in the wintertime when there's guys  in northern Montana that are trying to fight through four feet of snow to feed cows. Like,<br />

My question is, if there's four feet of snow for six months of the year, why do you own  cows? Like that becomes the question at that point, but we can't get there, right?<br />

So where are we going? All things appropriate in context,  but are we really asking ourselves the honest questions about, is what I'm doing appropriate<br />

Well, I can tell you, Brian, on that alfalfa subject, let me just, it's one of my learning  moments. I had this beautiful crop again now, monoculture, right? I was even proud of myself for<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:39:44">0:39:44-0:40:07</a>:</strong>  having sprayed it less often with glyphosate than was required under, you know, the growing  recommendations, but it was a culture and it is real pretty to a sod farmer to see,  you know, 30 inch alfalfa as green and lush as it could be with no contaminated weeds or anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:40:07">0:40:07-0:40:31</a>:</strong>  The next year I got decimated by weevil. That insect found the crop, you know, even at 7,000  feet and I had 100% loss. We didn't really bail anything. They came and maybe got 10 round bales  off of the whole farm. I realized one thing I had done was kill all the weeds in my pipe tracks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:40:31">0:40:31-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  I'm running handset aluminum irrigation because that's what I have from the sod farming days.  Like a side roll wheel line type thing?  No, on the ground, you know, two, three and four.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:52</a>:</strong>  On the ground, you know, three, two, three and four inch on the ground impact sprinklers every 60 feet.  Oh wow.  Handset like a lot of California farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:40:52">0:40:52-0:41:03</a>:</strong>  Okay.  That was the sod farmers deal, right? We would move those pipes out of the way, harvest, put them back.  I'm transitioning, but it's hard, right? I'm stuck in sort of my paradigm still, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:41:04">0:41:04-0:41:24</a>:</strong>  right, it was devastating to watch those weevils ruin my crop. First cutting and  I ordered some, I think it was a BT spray or it might've been spina sat. I don't remember one of  the organic insecticides and I was like, I'm going to take care of this problem. I didn't spray it<br />

I'm learning these people, these sort of gurus about the fact  that I may be just asking for more trouble because I'm killing off other insects, maybe not all,  but I'm killing off other insects. And I started observing. I started looking and I get on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:41:42">0:41:42-0:42:03</a>:</strong>  ground and I'm crawling around and on the thistle, Ryan, you would find all of these ladybug larva  and they'd like love it. And I said, no wonder I destroyed all the thistle. It was so clean  and so beautiful, but I took away all the beneficial insects. The next year, I let it go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:42:03">0:42:03-0:42:26</a>:</strong>  Not only did I let it go, but I was trying to learn what all kinds of critters I could,  insect type critters that I could promote on my farm. And to be honest, I think the one that  solved the evil problem was parasitoid wasps. The next season, Ryan, there was during this,<br />

Everywhere, everywhere. I was like, what is going on? You know, a little bit creepy.  Yeah. We will has never, ever made a presence on my farm since in the last seven years, six years,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:42:46">0:42:46-0:43:06</a>:</strong>  the weevil you'll come and then it just goes away. The beneficial insects keep it from becoming  a problem. And I'm not spraying anything. I'm just leaving some of my chicory because I've got a  bunch of plants, areas where I got chicory growing. And I think those wasps are breeding in the stock<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:43:06">0:43:06-0:43:23</a>:</strong>  of that chicory. I quit mowing down all my stuff in the winter time to leave these breeding sites.  I don't know. I'm no entomologist, but all I'll tell you is it has gotten to be a passion of mine  to see bugs. And I mean, I I'll take bugs in and look at them under my little sort of cheap<br />

And I still would like some help. You know, there's that Diasys, I think it's called  foundation. This guy, yep. And he's, he's big into insects. I would love to get involved somehow,<br />

The Audubon Society, I have been watching the bird population,  right? And I have ground nesting birds. And I'm even trying to figure out through my intensive<br />

There's no question they have a large role, what they do. I don't know. But there's many more of  them now. And you can't fool the birds. Did you know the Audubon Society has a conservation<br />

I am trying to get my farm, be what they call it, be safe, be something,  I don't know. Yeah, so I spent, I'm working through that process too. And it's, it hasn't been  short. I'm not gonna say it's been hard. I haven't had to jump through any flaming hoops. I've been<br />

Pheasant's Forever  Quail Forever came out, wrote the habitat management plan. And I've been audited by  Food Alliance. So like I am, this is the first time I've said anything about it on the podcast,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:25</a>:</strong>  because there are so many steps in this process. But I am like, maybe within the next couple of  episodes, hopefully by the end of the year, I'll be formally part of the Audubon Conservation Ranching  family. I hope to be there with you. There's a, there's, it's like anything else. When it comes to,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:44</a>:</strong>  even though I don't want to call it a bureaucracy, it's a little bit. The paperwork side, I've spent  a long time working on, and I read through all of the requirements. But we're running into this  thing where there's a discussion about 50% of your acres under management, according to the way I<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:46:11</a>:</strong>  read it, need to be managed for, you know, bird biodiversity and bird habitat. And the way some  people have read it is that it needs to be 50% native range. My farm doesn't have any native  range unless you count some wetlands as part of that. But way over percent of it at any one time<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:46:11">0:46:11-0:46:32</a>:</strong>  is in perennial plants cover mostly pasture, right? No, no monocrops anymore. I have ruined  my alfalfa stands with a bunch of overseeding. I'm putting so much stuff in there, letting the  weeds grow and grazing for diversity, not grazing for alfalfa production anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:51</a>:</strong>  But I am doing that. I believe that my farm is, and I think the evidence shows,  Brian, I had a swamp hawk. It's a Northern Harrier. Show up on my farm for the first time  four years ago, five years ago, something like that. And it was cool. It was cool to see him<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:46:51">0:46:51-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  fighting with the red tails, you know, playing with them sometimes, I think too. But for two  years, I loved seeing this animal come in and hunt my farm. Two years ago, there was two of them.  I was like, Oh my God, I got to prepare of these animals here, right? And I was super<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:31</a>:</strong>  excited. I'd been putting up raptor poles using old three inch aluminum pipe and sticking it to  the top of my fence poles way up in the air and trying to help my raptors to hunt.  And this last year, I saw one of those swamp hawks. And I was really sad because I figured<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:47:31">0:47:31-0:47:47</a>:</strong>  the other one had gotten munched by something. But I'm too pessimistic at times, Brian.  Come, I think it was June or July, all of a sudden there was four. There was four.  There you go. They had been sharing, I think, this is just my speculation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:47:47">0:47:47-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  sharing response down the nest. And there was four and they would fly around me when I was out  there building paddock. They'd be screaming at me. And it was like, it's a proof that I'm doing  something right. If those orders of animals, you know, in that trophic cascade, I think they call<br />

If those things are getting that complex, I know I'm doing something right, you know?  And I've even had the red, those cranes, I've had them breed successfully on the farm now a couple  of years. It's super cool to see. And so I know I'm doing well. And I feel like if I can<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:48:27">0:48:27-0:48:50</a>:</strong>  convince the folks at Audubon that I am, my farm is in the right mode, we are doing the right things.  I actually am not that concerned about circations, somewhat out of principle, if you will.  I'm real skeptical of greenwashing. Yep, yep. We can circle back to that one later.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:48:50">0:48:50-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  So I'll say this about the Audubon Conservation Ranching and the Blue Nest Beef Program.  Yeah. If you're hung up on some of the things in that application,  and you haven't talked to, I believe his name is Chris Wilson. If you're hung up on the application,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:49:05">0:49:05-0:49:23</a>:</strong>  you haven't had a conversation with Chris, you need to call him. And he'll walk you through,  and he'll tell you what you need to worry about and what you don't. And he'll keep you moving on  that process if you're hung up on that application. And I was just on there looking because I was,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:49:23">0:49:23-0:49:40</a>:</strong>  you know, just wanting to see where everybody was at. I don't think there's anybody in Colorado  that's in the Audubon Conservation Ranching Program. Well, the Parker Pastures folks,  Bill and Kelly Parker, Gunnison, they're there. And part of the reason I started this journey is<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:49:40">0:49:40-0:49:57</a>:</strong>  because they've been real helpful to me. You know, I even went and visited Bill and chatted  with him about stuff. They're a great family. They're people who recognize me, they're in the  direct consumer beef business in Colorado. And so they could view me as a competitor and just<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:49:57">0:49:57-0:50:16</a>:</strong>  shut me down, but they didn't. They're super welcoming and kind. And they have that certification.  Now, they're working on a lot of these native range up there and then pastures and stuff. So  I suspect it was kind of a shoe in for them, but they are there and they have the label on their<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:50:16">0:50:16-0:50:32</a>:</strong>  beef. They get theirs processed, the same processor I do. In fact, I think I mimic them  because I was like, where am I going to get my beef done that's any good? Because there's no  processing in our valley. It's one of the things I've got a bone with, but they got it done. And so<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:50:34">0:50:34-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  I feel like my farm should participate. I feel like the marketing, it might help, Brian. I mean,  I'm trying to sell beef these days. And I think you're just now starting that process yourself.  I've sold a little, not much, just a little. We're working on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  I'm working on it. It's going pretty well, but I've got a walk-in freezer that I bought from my  cousin who had been doing a beef and pork and chicken operation in Eastern Colorado.  I bought a walk-in and it is packed. It's so full. I've got to start moving more beef and it's going,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:34</a>:</strong>  but building my market, this is only the second year we've been actively marketing beef off the  farm. And there's a tug of war going between how many animals I want to run to heal my ground and  how many I can get sold out the door. Yeah, that's always a fun bit of math to try to work out. How<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:51:34">0:51:34-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  many should I be running? How many do I need to make a living? And how many do I think I can sell?  And if you think you can sell a bunch, you're probably wrong. And you need to have a place to  be able to store a bunch of those. So what are your customers? What's your customer base? If you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:52:17</a>:</strong>  could tell me what your average customer looks like and what's your demographic?  I think I've been using the term avatar for that person. And I think I kind of guessed it ahead of  time, but it's proven out to be upper middle-class women. I mean, it's almost exclusively women,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:52:17">0:52:17-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  not entirely, but mostly women driving these purchases. They tend to be between 30 and 50.  Again, that's sort of demographically average. And they are looking for specifically local first  and second, grass fed, whatever. And I am promoting my regenerative farm as a way to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:52:45">0:52:45-0:53:03</a>:</strong>  both have your beef and say that you are on the planet at the same time. I believe it. I don't  believe it to be greenwashing, Brian. I believe even though my farm is small, if somebody comes  and stands on my farm and sees the impact those animals are having directly on the ground, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:53:03">0:53:03-0:53:23</a>:</strong>  and I both agree that that is the way the land wakes up. It is being healed. Yes, I destroy it  largely, right? And the people I worked for. And to be honest, probably the farmers before that,  there was a lot of pretty rough treatment of that ground before even-<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:53:23">0:53:23-0:53:42</a>:</strong>  Probably a chain of poor decisions going all the way back to the original settlers.  Colorado potatoes, it were huge in this valley. And I think the potato beetle and every other  disease probably started wiping out some of this potato production about the time that Idaho got<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:53:42">0:53:42-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  more competitive. So there's still ancient remnants of potato harbors on my farm.  But clearly there was, it was, and then they started grazing, but I think it was  set stock, continuous grazing. Everything that I've learned. So yes, it is natural.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:22</a>:</strong>  West Jackson talks about the fact that there's degraded land everywhere. I think  Gabe Brown always says it too. Every land has been degraded by us. Mine just happens to be an  intense version of that. So to see that that beef is healing, the production of that beef is healing<br />

It is tangible. My problem is I don't have the skill  or the time to do enough monitoring. So I've been trying to figure out how to get help with that.  I want to be able to apply how I'm helping the ground. And I'd like to test my beef for<br />

I watch what they're eating and I know they taste good. Now we are talking about  largely Angus mix here that I'm running. So they fatten pretty well. These are moderate framed,  a lot of that kit ferro genetics in there. So that part is just getting lucky, I guess,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:55:05">0:55:05-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  where the stock are coming from. But I know they taste good. I'd like to see how much  this biodiversity and the healing of the soil affects that. I think it's a good thing.  It affects that nutrient density, if you will. That's a big point to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:55:23">0:55:23-0:55:44</a>:</strong>  You brought up Fred Provenza earlier. And that was love doing an interview. Fred was just  awesome to talk to. And we talk about the flavor of the land and nutritional wisdom.  The couple of cattle that I've kept pieces of and we've been eating that are processed here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:55:44">0:55:44-0:56:03</a>:</strong>  So I took these cows from the native range pasture where they had a protein tub.  And I took them to the processor. So I'm going to say it was pasture finished, not even grass  finished. Pasture finished on native range, about as low energy budget as you can get.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:56:05">0:56:05-0:56:20</a>:</strong>  And so when we're out at Regenerate, I had pictures of a ribeye and of us of,  I think, two ribeyes and two storylines, one from each animal. And I showed our friend Mike  Calacrate and he's like, oh, that's probably a great high choice. Which, okay, just looking at<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:56:20">0:56:20-0:56:43</a>:</strong>  a picture in a vacuum wrapped on somebody's cell phone. If he thinks they're great, high choice,  that tells me that it's probably fairly decent quality. But what I'm getting at is  what's the first time we tasted that meat. I can close my eyes and I can see the pasture<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:56:43">0:56:43-0:57:03</a>:</strong>  they were standing in the day before they went to the processor plant. And as I'm eating it,  my brain is picking up the different flavonoids and different notes in the meat. And that's what  some people might call quote, gamey. That's not gamey. That's the flavor of the land. That's the<br />

If you want it to be slightly sweet,  mostly flavorless, you can feed it corn for 60 to 90 days and you can get that flavor.  If you want something that's packed with nutrients, has an amazing bouquet of flavors,<br />

Well, Brian, I hear what you're saying. And I feel like what I'm actually shooting for,  and I think you talked about this a little, is a bit of a compromise there.<br />

Yeah. Let's just say for the sake of the people that don't know who Anibal is,  if you want to know how to grass finish an animal and make it taste good,<br />

That's why I went to him. And his studies, he gets into fat and tenderness and all of those  things and perceptions. And that word gamey, you bring up what that means because it doesn't mean<br />

He tends to use the term off-the-top. He's a good guy.  He tends to use the term off flavors also because that can come from too low of a pH,  an acidic soil base. It's very likely that you'll get these metallic notes or<br />

But in my neck of the woods, I'm trying to convince people who  largely like, they prefer their flavorless grain finished feedlot beef from Costco. And their  history, if they tried grass finish was, I don't like it. It's tough, lean and gamey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=0:58:59">0:58:59-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  But Anibal says, and I have proven out, is that if your primary nutrition right towards the end  comes from alfalfa and rye grass, there is an amazing amount of no gaminess in that meat.  I contend that you will still get a deep nutritional profile based on that entire<br />

Stored in those muscle tissue bones and the ligaments are that diverse array,  especially in some of my most diverse pastures. We're talking crazy amounts of things,  including thistle. They paddle thus far have learned to love thistle flowers. They eat them<br />

I don't know how that tongue is so tough, but they pop those thistles  in their mouths and it's wonderful to see. But that when you talk about the flavonoids and  the terpenes and all of those compounds that Fred talks about being in there from native range,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:00:03">1:00:03-1:00:24</a>:</strong>  particularly, even if they self-medicate because they feel something off balance and  persistent in the room. I try to provide as much of that as I can through as much of the season  on fairly managed pastures. We are talking, I have chicory and I have plantain and lots of dandelions<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:43</a>:</strong>  and a lot of different clovers, not just alfalfa in there. And then of course, there's grass  diversity as well. Some natives, some quite a bit of Timothy. And I'm trying to just get  everything I can out there, but at the end of the time, I'm putting them into those fields.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:00:44">1:00:44-1:01:04</a>:</strong>  It's a little scary because of the bloat potential that I've been told over and over by my neighbors  is going to kill everything. So far so good. But these cattle, their rumens get really adjusted  to our place. And by that time I can put them in a field that's only got 20%<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:01:06">1:01:06-1:01:26</a>:</strong>  grasses and weeds and stuff in that alfalfa. And as long as it's at that stage of alfalfa  where those blooms are coming in strong, they love it. And I'm looking at and taking pictures of  cow do every day. I never realized how important that was going to be to my life.<br />

And, but I, you know, times they a little rich and I got to start,  I pull some through the day. You know, I'm working on a grazing system where I'm giving  them a different breakfast than they're getting for, you know, post lunch and dinner, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:01:43">1:01:43-1:02:01</a>:</strong>  Trying to focus on those, those legumes, the heavier ones in the late afternoon, you know,  as those, as those sugars are building as high as possible, the bricks level, which I'm only  just learning to test. I'd like to just be able to taste it myself, but I haven't calibrated,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:02:01">1:02:01-1:02:13</a>:</strong>  I haven't calibrated my brain yet. So I can't quite do it.  You can't taste the difference between four and 4.5. Trust me. You just can't, you can't. Maybe  between five and 10, but between four and four and a half, it doesn't work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:02:15">1:02:15-1:02:35</a>:</strong>  Some of that sand point looks edible. So I've tried it, but it's, it's not quite as tasty as I,  as it looks. I can imagine. I think that bricks testing is a good thing, but what is it? I don't  think we really all know what it means yet. Like I think we're just starting to understand,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:02:36">1:02:36-1:02:55</a>:</strong>  okay, more sugars is better, more sugars, more gain. I get that. But what if the line is fuzzy?  What if the line is sharp and bright? You know, that, that may mean different things.  And how the bricks responds during the day, all in a plant community in a specific area,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:02:55">1:02:55-1:03:17</a>:</strong>  how that bricks responds, you know, during the day between, you know, sunrise, peak photosynthesis,  and sunset. That could be different from the same species of plant on the other side of the pasture  for reasons we don't understand. Yes. And what complicates it even more is, is the input<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:03:17">1:03:17-1:03:38</a>:</strong>  from the farmers, the individuals. Every one of these cattle is an individual, even though it's  sometimes really interesting to think about it that way. But I watched the distinct patterns,  both in performance, how they respond to pastures, how much one is eating versus the other. And,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:03:38">1:03:38-1:03:54</a>:</strong>  and clearly what they're choosing, you know, I mean, they're, I had this leaders, ones that  really enjoyed it and others that were sort of turned off by it. So you get a complication of  the temporal things through a day. And all I can do is try to rest on those principles, like you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:03:54">1:03:54-1:04:10</a>:</strong>  said, trying to maximize those sugars, but also like Temple Grandin and Joel Salitan, I heard them  in a conversation recorded not that long ago. And he was talking about how you'd always move  his cows at the same time of day, whether it was between four and five o'clock. And she started<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:04:10">1:04:10-1:04:23</a>:</strong>  talking about being more flexible, not training those cattle that's always the same time every  day. And I think that's a really interesting thing because you've seen them pile up at that,  at that gate, because they, they get trained exactly to know what it is. She's right. The more<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:04:23">1:04:23-1:04:39</a>:</strong>  I, I forced some variety in their lives, the less crazy they are about, you know, when they're going  to move. But I think it also would lead to this, each individual learning something different and,  and getting a little more diversity out of it. These are all just principles. And if I apply<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:04:39">1:04:39-1:05:01</a>:</strong>  this in a different way, half of the time, I get that the machines that I use are like you've  mentioned about antibiotics, we've just had no health problems. And I do, I do some crazy things  like well, I put organic apple cider vinegar in their water tanks every day. I don't know what it<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:05:01">1:05:01-1:05:18</a>:</strong>  does. But I'm convinced by you know, what they tell me that that probably helps.  is just too expensive and hard to get for me and I need two semi loads a year.  It's not really a thing I'm into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:05:18">1:05:18-1:05:38</a>:</strong>  In your context, that's an issue that maybe out in your range, you've got different  Forbes that can offer something of the micronutrient profile that in my sort of manufactured fields  I don't get, but I'm also trying to produce a product that is super intensive, that is<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:05:38">1:05:38-1:05:52</a>:</strong>  going to be pretty costly based on my needs.  The land costs alone where I live are so crazy per acre that if you're going to justify  raising cattle, you're going to have to make sure that you're selling that for a premium.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:05:52">1:05:52-1:06:10</a>:</strong>  And even then at the prices I'm selling it for, I'm really not even putting into the  production costs like the RFP school taught me to land costs and overheads.  They are at the moment left to the side because if I put them in, it's depressing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:06:10">1:06:10-1:06:24</a>:</strong>  So I'm mostly dealing with direct costs in my equation right now.  As long as you're honest with yourself about that, that's what really matters.  And I know it's part of the plan, but you talk about salt and scenery and that's what<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:06:24">1:06:24-1:06:32</a>:</strong>  I'm shooting for.  That C90 for example, that you even advertise, my cattle love it.  I actually like it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:06:32">1:06:32-1:06:43</a>:</strong>  It tastes really good.  And when I mix, I grow garlic on the farm.  One of the side enterprises that a friend and I are working on is growing garlic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:06:43">1:06:43-1:06:53</a>:</strong>  I was blending up the weird cloves into a paste and mixing into my C90.  Oh, I bet they loved it.  Yeah, they think it's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:06:53">1:06:53-1:07:07</a>:</strong>  And the fly control, it seems to help.  I don't have a huge problem with that anyway, but I kind of figure I'd rather do any of  these things, put that into my direct costs, trying to figure out my price per pound to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:07:07">1:07:07-1:07:21</a>:</strong>  sell and recognize that it's saving me, I hope, antibiotic bills.  Because once I put antibiotics in them based on my protocols, they got to get pulled and  sent to the market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:07:21">1:07:21-1:07:31</a>:</strong>  They got to go to the commodity system, to the feedlot where they don't give a shit  if they're pumped full of antibiotics.  And I would like to do that to no animals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:07:31">1:07:31-1:07:41</a>:</strong>  To be honest, my goal is to not have that happen.  And thus far, I've been okay.  I only brought in 31 head this year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:07:41">1:07:41-1:07:53</a>:</strong>  So, like you said, small scale and starting.  You got to start where you are.  And the enterprise has to fit the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:07:53">1:07:53-1:08:05</a>:</strong>  If you brought in 60, you'd have to buy a bunch of inputs.  You'd have to buy a bunch of feed.  And then it wouldn't be anything resembling a sustainable or remotely regenerative operation<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:08:05">1:08:05-1:08:18</a>:</strong>  because you're having to import that much feed.  Yeah, and I probably on my production, I probably could have handled that this year, just seeing  how quickly Brian, my fields are responding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:08:18">1:08:18-1:08:29</a>:</strong>  The growth is amazing.  So it's what's a lure, it's attempt to get more animals in there.  But I don't have the funds to build a 2000 square foot freezer, which is what would happen<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:08:29">1:08:29-1:08:39</a>:</strong>  if I couldn't sell them fast enough.  I could send them all to the butcher all day and pay for the processing.  But if I'm not selling enough, that equation goes upside down pretty fast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:08:39">1:08:39-1:08:51</a>:</strong>  And so that is, it's again, it's that seesaw that I'm working out.  My market's growing.  But, you know, to be perfectly honest, I have to keep in mind, I don't know that this is<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:08:51">1:08:51-1:09:03</a>:</strong>  going to be an effective stainless enterprise for me, right?  I mean, I have another farmer who's been really helpful to Jake and Molly Shipman run this  farm called Dooley Creek.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:09:03">1:09:03-1:09:17</a>:</strong>  And they are again, direct consumer people, they've been so helpful in getting me going.  And they're right here in my valley.  You know, I may end up leaning on them to move more animals, simply because you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:09:17">1:09:17-1:09:24</a>:</strong>  I got to look at that as a bigger picture.  And what's right for my farm.  I don't want weddings on this farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:09:24">1:09:24-1:09:36</a>:</strong>  But I may have to even look at things like, you know, agritourism, I have a really pretty  setting on my farm.  Maybe I've got to do more of that and less beef, but I will need the animals to keep<br />

And I the phrase I use Brian because regenerative is a struggle with that word.  It's just a word.<br />

So I like my mission statement is re nourishing earth, because that's what I feel like I'm  doing in the entire cycle is putting actual nourishment to a living soil in the form of<br />

And the rest of my management trying to capitalize on the energy from the sun and then the nourishment  coming out is those that nourishing meats you're talking about that taste.<br />

And then when a horse shows up, and somebody on that horse starts moving a little fast,  those cows get triggered real quick.<br />

I mean, you know, it's a little bit a little odd, that part.  But I want them to understand that it's part of the philosophy.<br />

And there is a smell that you probably know, but I didn't know it for the first 15 years<br />

I didn't know what soil could smell like.  When I turned, which I did drop a two bottom plow in the soil and flipped over all this<br />

And yes, I put it back into turf grass, that acres, and now it's back to pretty sick, not<br />

It's just one of the struggles of recognizing that regenerating is a real thing, but sometimes  I'm cashing out that bank account of what I've regrown in order to stay on the farm.<br />

And I did kind of want to ask you if you had some sort of succession plan that was interested<br />

And I think a lot of operators are facing, well, I think a lot of operators are older  than I am.<br />

It's in the upper sixties now in agriculture.  So, there's a whole generation of guys that are facing retirement.<br />

And the whole business of enriching all the people that are farming the farmers.<br />

There's not any incentive in the system for those older operators to pass down that land<br />

They have the incentive to hold on to it as long as possible.  So that land asset that they've had in this commodity production scheme for decades stays<br />

The land prices in the I states, like I'm thinking of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, where  they grow all of the frickin' corn, where a lot of the farm subsidies go, they're still<br />

But somehow people are still buying it and they're still staying in business.  John Deere makes bigger tractors and bigger combines every year that cost more money.<br />

Beef prices aren't high, people.  They're getting close to where they should be to reflect the actual cost of production.<br />

Brian, what you brought up there is one of the biggest fundamental when I think about  the bigger picture of agriculture in general, our environment, our economy.<br />

He talks about an economy, which is the same in farming I believe until you get into a<br />

In that trade-off scenario is how we've gotten to this low commodity price, that ex-fidelity,  externalizing, as the economists call it, all of the costs onto everybody else.<br />

I think that's true across the board in this system.  Almost every true cost to our environment has been externalized and a true cost accounting.<br />

<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:27:08">1:27:08-1:27:22</a>:</strong>  So what's the basic economy?  A human being needs food, water and air to live.  And food we can generally obtain from our natural environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:27:22">1:27:22-1:27:31</a>:</strong>  It takes a little bit of labor and a little bit of creativity.  Water is a little bit easier for most people.  You can go to a creek, you can go to a stream and you can drink, you go to a pond and drink.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:27:31">1:27:31-1:27:38</a>:</strong>  You can't just find food falling off every tree everywhere unless you know exactly where  to look.  And that takes knowledge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:27:38">1:27:38-1:27:52</a>:</strong>  It takes some skill.  So the basic unit of the economy is those that could find the food and bring the food  back to the community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:27:52">1:27:52-1:28:04</a>:</strong>  They would get a trade.  They would get a labor trade or a value trade for the calories that they brought.  And that's the start of trade.<br />

You look at my apples and go, man, those would be delicious.  And I look at my apples and go, man, an orange would be delicious.<br />

Let's make a value trade for that.  And so we invented this thing called money, currency, greenbacks, dollars, pesos, rubles,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:28:26">1:28:26-1:28:47</a>:</strong>  cents, whatever the hell you want to call them.  Food is energy, food is life, and to some extent, money is just a way to store energy.  It's a way to store energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:28:47">1:28:47-1:29:04</a>:</strong>  It's a way to store food long term because that's what it really comes down to.  The people that can't grow their food, a thousand years ago when we were all living in tribes  and trees, a thousand years ago the people that couldn't grow food, they're in town,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:29:04">1:29:04-1:29:17</a>:</strong>  they're making the pots, they're weaving the fucking clothes, they're cooking the things,  they're being the altar boy for the priest, whatever.  The people that could grow the food or could go out to the forest and get it, they would<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:29:17">1:29:17-1:29:22</a>:</strong>  bring it back.  There would be some sort of value exchange.  To me, that's the basic unit of the economy.<br />

I give you food, you give me something of equivalent value for it.  So every time that we want to, quote, grow the economy, we're not actually growing the<br />

We're just adding another layer into an existing system to extract another layer of wealth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:29:53">1:29:53-1:29:59</a>:</strong>  Are you following me?  Mostly, yeah.  So we have these systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:29:59">1:29:59-1:30:12</a>:</strong>  Okay, so let's talk farming.  So we go back a hundred years.  Everybody's doing, you know, a hundred years ago everybody was farming with mules, mule<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:30:12">1:30:12-1:30:17</a>:</strong>  teams.  Well, what's the next big invention?  Tractor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:30:17">1:30:17-1:30:31</a>:</strong>  You can have this little itty bitty tractor that takes one guy to run that makes 25 horsepower  that replaces your 16 head team of mules and all the feed it takes to run them.  Oh, that seems like a good deal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:30:31">1:30:31-1:30:45</a>:</strong>  So now we've made that value trade between taking animals as part of a cycle, as part  of a system.  We're taking the animals that added their labor and their biology back to the land in<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:30:45">1:30:45-1:30:59</a>:</strong>  the process of working it to prepare for another crop.  We completely remove that and we put a diesel fuel powered tractor out there running on  rubber tires or I mean if you're really old, a steam tractor on steam rims, whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:30:59">1:30:59-1:31:11</a>:</strong>  But we replace that with mechanical horsepower with industrialized horsepower.  Those 16 mules aren't peeing and pooping as they're walking across the field anymore.  Now I've got a tractor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:31:11">1:31:11-1:31:21</a>:</strong>  Now you don't have to have 10 guys to maintain the mule team, maintain the equipment for  the mules, have a blacksmith on site, have a ferry on site.  You don't have to have any of that crap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:31:21">1:31:21-1:31:29</a>:</strong>  You just need a part-time mechanic and a parts dealer.  So we make a value trade.  I mean we think okay that's a good trade.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:31:29">1:31:29-1:31:37</a>:</strong>  We're saving a lot of labor.  We have all these labor saving appliances, these things that save labor.  What if those are all bullshit?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:31:37">1:31:37-1:31:54</a>:</strong>  What if really the value of this world is the human labor that it takes to produce food?  If that's the only thing that has value or if that's the base unit of value, the human  labor and the resources it requires to produce an energy of food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:31:54">1:31:54-1:32:08</a>:</strong>  If we correctly account for that energy, whether it's human energy, animal energy or fossil  fuel energy, I think the books are going to start to balance.  But I don't think anybody's going to like the math.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:32:08">1:32:08-1:32:25</a>:</strong>  That part, if you were to see true cost accounting, I'm not sure what the ramifications for our  lifestyles would be, but there's no question there would be some changes.  And personally, for example, one of the things would be travel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:32:25">1:32:25-1:32:44</a>:</strong>  The money that the wealthier nations spend on travel for leisure probably starts to become  untenable and I really like to travel.  So I mean, these are things that I've been confronting in my own life, in my own accounting,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:32:44">1:32:44-1:33:01</a>:</strong>  but you're absolutely right about this fundamental equation.  Now I would argue that very quickly after the trade of the energy, we are in human systems.  So one of the things, we could talk about shelter and what housing means to us, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:33:01">1:33:01-1:33:21</a>:</strong>  that relates to the next part, which is to protect this human from those humans who don't  want to play by any kind of trade rules and they just want to come kill you, you start  relying on the king or whoever is in charge of the tools and the iron.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:33:21">1:33:21-1:33:33</a>:</strong>  And now you've added this labor, like the beginning of the military industrial complex  to the system.  And because we're so busy growing food and taking care of our people that we don't have<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:33:33">1:33:33-1:33:48</a>:</strong>  time to defend ourselves against the guys in the other valley that can't quite grow  enough food for themselves that want to come over here and take our shit.  So let's all get together, we'll put somebody in charge and they can get a few guys around<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:33:48">1:33:48-1:33:59</a>:</strong>  or strong-arm men to help protect us.  And we'll just pay them, I don't know, one or two percent.  We'll just give them two percent of our crop every year so they can eat and they can feed<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:33:59">1:33:59-1:34:09</a>:</strong>  the army and protect us and life is good.  There you go.  That's how it fucking starts again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:34:09">1:34:09-1:34:26</a>:</strong>  Yes.  And I'll argue, you know, way more accounts of worms that opens up, but that today is  sort of the reality on the ground of where we find ourselves just exponentially exploded<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:34:26">1:34:26-1:34:36</a>:</strong>  with that percentage here in the United States, right?  What is it?  Five, five or plus percent of our GDP goes to military and probably more when you really<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:34:36">1:34:36-1:34:54</a>:</strong>  pin it down.  It is the existence of that protection of our system that is the only real backing behind  that money that that system by fiat, that's right, the dollar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:34:54">1:34:54-1:35:10</a>:</strong>  To be honest, it's it is only that military might, I think that backs it up.  The rules in that system to protect you from people that would break those rules is part  of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:35:10">1:35:10-1:35:20</a>:</strong>  Is it flawed?  Is it rife with with deceit and and all kinds of people taking advantage of it?  Of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:35:20">1:35:20-1:35:34</a>:</strong>  But you look at another currency that people really are hyped up about is crypto.  And what happens when there is no army by fiat to determine the value and to force the  rules?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:35:34">1:35:34-1:35:48</a>:</strong>  Well, you get you get some pain.  And that would be a whole nother conversation one day.  But that internalization of the costs, getting back to that energy exchange and some amount<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:35:48">1:35:48-1:36:02</a>:</strong>  of system to protect it, it's where we are trying to figure out how that relates to the  future because I mean, what is this is a temporal issue we're talking about.  And we are externalizing most of our costs onto the future, really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:36:02">1:36:02-1:36:24</a>:</strong>  Yes, there are pollution problems, for example, but it's, it's the cost to my kids generation,  and my grandchildren that don't exist that really, it's just my sod farming was, we were  taking and extracting energy, literal energy out of the soil for today's profits to to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:36:24">1:36:24-1:36:39</a>:</strong>  in this case, a lot of those profits were going to help poor people in Mexico.  Okay, so altruism doesn't make it okay that you were extracting it, but it's kind of the  makes it an interesting equation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:36:39">1:36:39-1:36:56</a>:</strong>  But it's just like that in our bigger economy, all that culture we are extracting from historically  what was put in there by the biological systems by creation, and we're extracting it for today's  profits at the expense of tomorrow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:36:56">1:36:56-1:37:08</a>:</strong>  And with you and I are around to we may be everybody, you tend to, you tend to be a little  pessimistic on a more short term than some people.  And I can't say I disagree with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:37:08">1:37:08-1:37:22</a>:</strong>  But that externalizing of costs and dumping them on the future is really what the whole  thing's about.  That energy exchange has become falsified, and the massive economy that this world puts<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:37:22">1:37:22-1:37:36</a>:</strong>  together.  If we don't try to stop it, like I did stop doing all the harm.  First, let nature and the only perpetual at least on the scale that we're talking about<br />

<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:37:43">1:37:43-1:37:53</a>:</strong>  And I don't care what science says that they're going to make it up.  It's just not a thing.  Anytime you've seen MIT try to put plants in a box.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:37:53">1:37:53-1:37:59</a>:</strong>  It doesn't actually work.  You know, I mean, that's just a fact.  It's like, it's like anything else we talked about earlier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:37:59">1:37:59-1:38:16</a>:</strong>  So yeah, those things, Brian, they're, they're big parts that are just the bigger outcrop  of what I did on my little micro scale on my tiny farm.  And to try to come to a true cost accounting, even on my farm is a super struggle right<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:38:16">1:38:16-1:38:31</a>:</strong>  now to make sure that I can afford the ridiculous land costs.  And if the interest rates are my interest rates variable on my land, no, I'm terrified.  I mean, it could destroy me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:38:31">1:38:31-1:38:46</a>:</strong>  I'm going to have to start affecting more, more money just to survive.  So these are all real things in our economy that you and I are talking about.  It's going to have to come to the same, the same moment of accountability.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:38:46">1:38:46-1:39:01</a>:</strong>  And I don't know how painful that's going to be.  And I we're in a strange spot because, okay, we have this, we have this weird intersection  between an entire generation of farmers and ranchers aging out an entire generation wanting<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:39:01">1:39:01-1:39:14</a>:</strong>  to get in, not having the capital to do it.  The generation wanting to get out, they can't give it away.  But on the same token, you can't take it with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:39:14">1:39:14-1:39:22</a>:</strong>  So you got to do something with it before you die.  Or do you?  I mean, I guess everybody has to answer these questions for themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:39:22">1:39:22-1:39:45</a>:</strong>  But so we have a generation with very little money that wants the land that an old generation  with assets has, but they don't have a way to get it.  And the energy required to continue farming and ranching the way we've been doing it since<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:39:45">1:39:45-1:39:55</a>:</strong>  the 50s and 60s, the energy is still there.  It's just too expensive.  It's going to be too expensive.<br />

And if I was a halfway decent podcaster like Clay Connery guy, I'd tell you the episode  right off the top of my head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:40:08">1:40:08-1:40:18</a>:</strong>  It was probably single digits.  It was pretty early on.  But I think in that conversation, I said something about $6 diesel fuel.<br />

<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:40:25">1:40:25-1:40:37</a>:</strong>  If you can't make your operation work with $20 diesel fuel, you need to figure it out  now and make some changes.  Okay, that's a light bulb.<br />

So what I'm getting at is like, we're at this nexus.  And I'm not sure what's going to happen.<br />

When they're in a feedlot, they're basically in prison in confinement in general population,<br />

I can imagine that that's kind of kind of what that's like.  I can't imagine that that's a healthy life for those animals.<br />

They deserve better than that.<br />

There are a journey of agriculture crap can't feed the planet.  Look, it's not an overnight easy transition.<br />

We can talk all we want about grass fed beef.  And yes, grass fed beef is the fastest growing market segment in the beef industry and has<br />

I mean, we've doubled the grass fed beef market in the last four years, and we're  going to double it again probably another three or four.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:42:56">1:42:56-1:43:08</a>:</strong>  And it's not just grass fed beef.  I mean, it's pasture raised, pasture finished.  You know, sperm to steak producers like yourself, like I'm trying to be where we want the<br />

And we want to show people what kind of care we're taking of the land and how good our  birds are, how good our insects are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:43:17">1:43:17-1:43:27</a>:</strong>  That's what we want to do.  Now I've got neighbors that are in cow calf.  They take okay care of the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:43:27">1:43:27-1:43:44</a>:</strong>  Most of them are tenants.  And you know, like when you're running Rivendell for the doctors that were in, you know, that  were down in Mexico, your job as manager run that place for profit because they want profit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:43:44">1:43:44-1:43:50</a>:</strong>  They need money to make their, they need money to make their dreams work.  There's nothing wrong with that.  It's their land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:43:50">1:43:50-1:44:03</a>:</strong>  They're entitled to run it however they want.  But you and your heart knew that over time that pouring all the chemicals year after  year and doing the same thing over and over, you're watching that land degrade.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:44:03">1:44:03-1:44:21</a>:</strong>  But you couldn't tell them that because they wouldn't believe you.  They didn't believe you as long as the inputs continued to give the appearance of working.  It wasn't until total system failure that they were willing to acknowledge that there<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:44:21">1:44:21-1:44:31</a>:</strong>  might have been a problem.  Do I have that right?  Yeah, and in fact, the doctor, brilliant guy, he came to me during one of those tough years<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:44:31">1:44:31-1:44:46</a>:</strong>  and said, oh, the solution is Roundup Ready bluegrass that that will fix your farm.  And I had already knew that there was no answer there.  But I couldn't, I couldn't say, well, no way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:44:46">1:44:46-1:44:57</a>:</strong>  But I did say, they're never gonna let that happen, which, honestly, thank God, the government  has not allowed that to happen.  Wheat was as far as they were trying to go and that even got out of the bag a little.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:44:57">1:44:57-1:45:11</a>:</strong>  But yes, that was the scenario.  And the sustainability, you hear people griping about the word sustainable.  I recognize that the words we use are important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:45:11">1:45:11-1:45:18</a>:</strong>  But the sustainable word is fine to me.  And you didn't say why sustain the degraded thing?  You're not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:45:18">1:45:18-1:45:27</a>:</strong>  It's truly sustainable, it's not degraded, it is in fact regenerating.  Whatever.  So the bottom line is, it was not sustainable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:45:27">1:45:27-1:45:40</a>:</strong>  And I'm fine using that word, because just what you're saying was going in a direction  and again, it ties into we were stealing from the future potential production of that land  for today's dollars.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:45:40">1:45:40-1:45:47</a>:</strong>  And those are very discounted, right?  That is a there's a huge discount, you're taking on that value.  It's a time value thing, maybe where today we need that money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:45:47">1:45:47-1:45:57</a>:</strong>  Because otherwise we won't survive.  So I recognize there may be some part of that.  But there is a there's an interest on the other side, there is an exponential decay<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:45:57">1:45:57-1:46:11</a>:</strong>  on the other side, that it's going to cost us huge.  So it's like, you were having conversation with Mary Jo the other day, and it was like  investment, it was this playing with money about where you're going to, to borrow money<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:46:11">1:46:11-1:46:19</a>:</strong>  from and where you're going to put it.  And if you're making a half percent over here, and you're borrowing at four and a half percent  there, maybe that makes sense, but not forever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:46:19">1:46:19-1:46:29</a>:</strong>  And she wouldn't say it either.  But the point was the differential.  And the way the system is just the way that the ecology works, you're going to get less<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:46:29">1:46:29-1:46:47</a>:</strong>  interest on today's dollars, then the system is going to take from you in tomorrow's dollars.  And so that that again, just ties back to real cost accounting, that that decision to  take money out in sod, I couldn't even put a number on where it is today, in terms of<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:46:47">1:46:47-1:46:59</a>:</strong>  how you know how my land very much of which still needs a lot of work, right?  I mean, we're, we're not out of the woods, that beautiful piece of pasture, you can see  on my website is a pretty small percentage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:46:59">1:46:59-1:47:07</a>:</strong>  Right?  That's, that's seven acres of 180 that I got to fix.  I'm really gonna screw you up now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:47:07">1:47:07-1:47:20</a>:</strong>  Okay, we were talking about true cost accounting.  And we talked about like cost of farming, externalizing cost of you know, all the pesticides  and antibiotic use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:47:20">1:47:20-1:47:35</a>:</strong>  So here's a good one.  I move a little bit of dirt every once in a while.  So let's just say, I know where there's a place not too far away from my ranch, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:47:35">1:47:35-1:47:47</a>:</strong>  there's a guy that will sell you topsoil.  He'll sell you topsoil for $20 a ton.  It's not bad, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:47:47">1:47:47-1:47:59</a>:</strong>  That's pretty decent price on topsoil.  Now let's talk about the, just your circle of, just your circle that you're growing  sod on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:47:59">1:47:59-1:48:12</a>:</strong>  How many tons of soil do you think you're taking off that sucker every year?  Well, each pallet is roughly a ton.  Now there's quite a bit of water weight, I suppose.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:48:12">1:48:12-1:48:23</a>:</strong>  Water and plant mass.  But literally every pallet.  And so say I get 20 acres in a year off of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:48:23">1:48:23-1:48:29</a>:</strong>  Well, that's 2000 tons.  Right?  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:48:29">1:48:29-1:48:44</a>:</strong>  So, and yes, it's real soil.  And I used to say, because where that sod is going, it's going to people's disturbed  landscapes around their newly built house, largely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:48:44">1:48:44-1:48:49</a>:</strong>  And I look at it sort of related to skin grafts and a burn victim.  Okay.  So their land is scarred.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:48:49">1:48:49-1:49:06</a>:</strong>  I've got this growing skin on my farm and we peel it up and we send it over and I heal  their land, kind of, I put green growing grass on it, off of my land.  And Brian, you know where they tend to take skin grafts from, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:49:06">1:49:06-1:49:16</a>:</strong>  Your legs or your ass cheek.  Yeah.  So I'm roughly the valley's ass cheek is what I've always said when it comes to land growing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:49:16">1:49:16-1:49:29</a>:</strong>  But at the end of the day, that was a, it was a justification, but that is exactly what  was happening.  I was hauling soil and living tissue off of my land and then having to regrow it using<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:49:29">1:49:29-1:49:42</a>:</strong>  synthetic external inputs.  The reality is of course, too, that if you look at even today, but it was, Hey, so for  the then it was for, for 10 years, it was Hey, going off my farm, which I've also put<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:49:42">1:49:42-1:49:55</a>:</strong>  an end to because the, Hey, wasn't soil, but it really was.  I was it's new.  It's it's exporting carbon and nutrients and all the things that that magic of photosynthesis<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:49:55">1:49:55-1:50:07</a>:</strong>  is producing and it's going away.  Now though, like you, I am, I put a stop to that and this year, anything I had to feed,  which was right at the end, I brought in a few bales off farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:50:07">1:50:07-1:50:22</a>:</strong>  So I'm, I'm bringing them in, but I'm also, I realized from a, from an ethical standpoint,  anybody sells me, Hey, I am also taking nutrients from their land.  Your neighbor that's selling his $20 a ton soil, you're degrading something by taking<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:50:22">1:50:22-1:50:26</a>:</strong>  that.  Right.  And I struggle with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:50:26">1:50:26-1:50:40</a>:</strong>  So if I can get, you know, Jim Garish, his kick in the hay habit deal, I'm trying to  think about it deeply on a system wide level.  If you could not do either, that is really what renourishes and regenerates your land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:50:40">1:50:40-1:50:47</a>:</strong>  And the only thing I'm exporting is beef.  That's the plan.  I don't know, but I like it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:50:47">1:50:47-1:51:02</a>:</strong>  So I brought up the cost of dirt and I was kind of questioning about, about your sod.  So to put it in perspective, and I'll just, I'll talk about like a typical wheat farm  here in Kansas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:51:02">1:51:02-1:51:16</a>:</strong>  Okay.  Where we're going to be fallow for basically just three, maybe four months during the summer.  Cause you know, that crop is, it goes in September, October, usually is sprouted well up by now,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:51:16">1:51:16-1:51:29</a>:</strong>  three, four inches, but it's, you know, we barely got about an inch of wheat because of  lack of moisture.  So we look at it, I look at a field like that and the data that I've come across seems to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:51:29">1:51:29-1:51:44</a>:</strong>  indicate that in my area of field under basically normal, the normal tillage practices for this  area, that that field is going to lose something about five tons, maybe 10 tons of top soil  per acre per year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:51:44">1:51:44-1:51:49</a>:</strong>  Okay.  Five tons of top soil per acre.  It sounds like it's literally nothing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:51:49">1:51:49-1:52:02</a>:</strong>  And it kind of almost is five tons of top soil per acre is about the sheet.  It was about as thick as a sheet of paper.  The thickness of a sheet of paper, you and I can't tell that in a year, over a couple<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:52:02">1:52:02-1:52:17</a>:</strong>  of decades, maybe we might be able to see that, but humans, we have this problem.  Our like our temporal sense of memory is AFU.  Like we don't, we can't remember what it looked like 20 years ago that it didn't have<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:52:17">1:52:17-1:52:27</a>:</strong>  erosion ruts that this field was level with that road ditch over there and it wasn't three  feet lower.  We don't remember that crap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:52:27">1:52:27-1:52:42</a>:</strong>  But what I'm getting at is the whole externalizing future costs or externalizing future debt.  I don't know.  There's a good term there I'll have to come up with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:52:42">1:52:42-1:53:00</a>:</strong>  I don't think that there's a commodity farmer in this country that would be in business  next year if they had to rebuy all the dirt that washed off their farm.  I don't think anyone or anybody would survive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:53:00">1:53:00-1:53:21</a>:</strong>  And I would, if you think that there's a corn, wheat, cotton, or soybean farmer in the world  that can afford to lose a hundred dollars an acre of soil washing off their field every  year, you're fucking delusional.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:53:21">1:53:21-1:53:39</a>:</strong>  Like how do we go to Indiana and Illinois and Iowa and buy land for $30,000 an acre  and let five tons an acre wash off of it down the Mississippi River every year?  Like how does this make sense?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:53:39">1:53:39-1:53:55</a>:</strong>  The only way it makes sense is if the system is completely broken and fraudulent and 100%  reliant on taxpayer subsidies to power the system and keep it going.  Yes, I agree, Ryan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:53:55">1:53:55-1:54:08</a>:</strong>  I mean, all I can say is that you and I can talk about it.  We can do what we can on our place to recognize our role in it, to minimize it.  And then the next part is that community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:54:08">1:54:08-1:54:15</a>:</strong>  I don't want to attack people.  Right?  I mean, this is where it gets a little, there's a tendency, I told you to quit, to not criticize<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:54:15">1:54:15-1:54:25</a>:</strong>  folks in industry because we're together in this.  Well, I need to try to convince as many people not to do what I did.  Right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:54:25">1:54:25-1:54:38</a>:</strong>  Now I have to take accountability for what I did to this piece of ground that I'm now  stewarding, but there's lots of it out there.  And the consumer, we talk about trying to convince them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:54:38">1:54:38-1:54:49</a>:</strong>  I don't know, but that community, all we could do is try to communicate it.  And then I need to be able to say, both of my grandfathers ran feedlots.  That is what they did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/ranching-reboot/episodes/94-Jared-Kerst-Future-externalized-costs-e1rvtj8#t=1:54:49">1:54:49-1:54:57</a>:</strong>  Right?  Mike Calacrate knew both of them.  And I remember my grandfather telling me that that smell that I would complain about was<br />

Like the greater system is crashing.<br />

I can see things that are going to blow up in locations and we just have to do our best<br />

That being said, you know, like the established order is changing.  The established order of agriculture is changing, of food production, of manufacturing, of distribution.<br />

Yeah, and as a monolith, you're probably right.  I just hope that little bits of pieces can be healthy enough, like you said, to weather<br />

It's building a local culture that's resilient and that takes care of itself and is less  reliant on outside inputs.<br />

I agree.<br />

You should definitely think about not being there and being somewhere where it's a lot  less populous, where maybe you have at least access to more than a poster stamp of land<br />

It took a lot of doing, but now I feel like even if I can't sustain the financial crash<br />

I guess here's the closing thought.  It seems like you've discovered that you have a passion and a drive to regenerate land,<br />

To put that value back in, let's just say the bank account of the soil.<br />

Man, this creek sure does have a lot of water in it for not having an inch of rain within<br />

I'm working towards it, you know, and I hope that Audubon helps me and maybe Ectyces folks,<br />
