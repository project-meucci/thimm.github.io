  <h1>43 The Story Philosophy And Principles Of Syntropic Farming With Marc Leiber</h1>

<p><strong>0:00:00-0:00:23:</strong>  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  our soils and ecosystems?  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?<br />
<strong>0:00:23-0:00:33:</strong>  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  these challenges.<br />
<strong>0:00:33-0:00:48:</strong>  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  So hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.<br />
<strong>0:00:48-0:01:02:</strong>  I'm your host Dimitri and today we have a bit of a special session because for once  I'm actually sitting here with a guest that we're going to have on the show and I'm really  happy to invite Mark, Mark Leiber.<br />
<strong>0:01:02-0:01:17:</strong>  Mark is actually my neighbour, we live in the same little village in Portugal so this  is really really cool.  He's also a friend of mine and Mark is an expert and a practitioner of syntropic agriculture.<br />
<strong>0:01:17-0:01:31:</strong>  We've had 40 episodes and not one of them yet has been syntropic agriculture so we thought  that it was really about time to get somebody on that could really give us an introduction  to what syntropic agriculture is and I thought Mark was the perfect person for this.<br />
<strong>0:01:31-0:01:41:</strong>  So without further ado I'm going to let Mark introduce himself and tell us a bit more about  his story and how he ended up here.  Welcome on the show Mark.<br />
<strong>0:01:41-0:02:01:</strong>  Thank you Dimitri for this invitation and the special honour to be here with all of  you listeners today.  As Dimitri said my name is Mark Leiber, I am born in Germany, I grew up in the United<br />
<strong>0:02:01-0:02:18:</strong>  States then with 18 years old I moved back to Germany.  From there I realised that I wanted to work with plants, it was when I was about 20, 21.  My step brother started a permaculture project in Kenya to support a local family, a small<br />
<strong>0:02:18-0:02:37:</strong>  landowner and it was a project that really touched me because my brother was being really  selfless and just really investing most of his money into this property, building houses,  planting fruit trees, buying the land itself, buying water pumps, creating all kinds of<br />
<strong>0:02:37-0:02:49:</strong>  structures for this local family to start being self-sufficient and he started, he went  to Australia to do a course with Jeff Loughton in permaculture.  He started talking a lot about permaculture and he was applying all these techniques there<br />
<strong>0:02:49-0:03:12:</strong>  on this property in Kenya and it moved me when he started doing this and made me want  to get into the same thing because I really saw a lot of truth in the idea of not sending  money to countries where people have lack of food and other resources but instead going<br />
<strong>0:03:12-0:03:25:</strong>  there and helping them to sustainably look after themselves.  So I asked him what he thought that I could do in order to help him because I wanted to  get on board with this project with him.<br />
<strong>0:03:25-0:03:46:</strong>  He's a golf teacher by profession which would allow him to spend the winters travelling  to Australia, to Kenya and these places but so he has no formal education in agriculture  and so he said well if you could study agriculture then we would have somebody with a deeper<br />
<strong>0:03:46-0:04:08:</strong>  insight into the whole technicalities of the project and we could maybe make more of these  kind of projects and so I got really excited about this idea and I started trying to register  for agricultural degree and it turned out to be super difficult because my diploma from<br />
<strong>0:04:08-0:04:26:</strong>  the US was not sufficient to enrol in university in Europe.  I probably would have also not gotten in university in the US because I had never done an SAT  and you know I had kind of been a bit careless in my high school years about being in school<br />
<strong>0:04:26-0:04:46:</strong>  and so you know like I then had these consequences that I actually had a very difficult time  getting into a school and well I found this one school in the Netherlands and it seemed  really appealing and it was kind of like it just somehow happened that it was a funny<br />
<strong>0:04:46-0:05:02:</strong>  story but in the end they admitted me into the study programme and I mean from there  a lot of really beautiful things came.  The study itself I would say was not really what affected me so like of course it had<br />
<strong>0:05:02-0:05:17:</strong>  imprint on me because we learned a lot about the technicalities of how plants work, the  morphology, the processes on a cell level and this kind of stuff is really interesting,  genetics, breeding, all this kind of stuff we learned about.<br />
<strong>0:05:17-0:05:38:</strong>  We also had some classes about economics and marketing classes but in general it was a  very conventional you know it was mainly horticulture so greenhouse, how's it called, ornamental  plant growing but also like tomatoes and cucumbers and then a bit of like arable land agriculture<br />
<strong>0:05:38-0:05:56:</strong>  like but really limited like potatoes, corn and almost already stopped there like wheat  or something like this was hardly ever addressed so this is like really like corn, potatoes  and greenhouses like really like the Dutch kind of thing you know.<br />
<strong>0:05:56-0:06:19:</strong>  You know we had the good thing about the studies was that it had attracted quite an international  group of people with different backgrounds and different fields of interest and we also  had a lot of freedom to how does it say like construct the studies as we saw fit to ourselves<br />
<strong>0:06:19-0:06:38:</strong>  and our interests so we had like two years of actual theoretical studies and then the  third and the fourth year you're pretty much free to do whatever you saw fit you know you  had to meet like certain requirements and stay within the structure of the whole expectations<br />
<strong>0:06:38-0:06:59:</strong>  but there was like if you knew how to operate within that and especially if you had like  a capacity of writing emotionally profound and how's it called like messages to the board  member like the directory of the boards you know you could get like special requests through<br />
<strong>0:06:59-0:07:17:</strong>  to make like things that were maybe not like entirely foreseen but that you like you know  if you were like really like determined and you could express that in some kind of way  then you could get away with doing some quite cool stuff and so you know I in the first<br />
<strong>0:07:17-0:07:36:</strong>  study year it was really when the first moments when I really started working with trees I  did an internship in an organic tree nursery flores naturalica bomb and then doing the  Netherlands and so flores he has a really interesting assortment of all kinds of fruit<br />
<strong>0:07:36-0:07:56:</strong>  varieties mainly focusing at the time he was mainly focusing on heritage apple pear cherry  plum and so on so forth varieties and I learned a number of things there first of all like  I planted my first trees in my life there then you know like how to measure row how<br />
<strong>0:07:56-0:08:12:</strong>  to you know prepare soil how to dig how to graft how to prune he taught me how to use  chainsaws he taught me how to use a tractor he taught me how to climb trees with the harness  how to prune safely because he was also doing tree maintenance and how to use wood chippers<br />
<strong>0:08:12-0:08:28:</strong>  and so like the whole package like everything like he gave me like pretty much like the  crash course of everything it was really practical approach and I really like self-learning approach  and I think like being with flores to me was like the perfect preparation for going to<br />
<strong>0:08:28-0:08:46:</strong>  ernst because flores like the first time he ever let me use a chainsaw I think I was wearing  shorts and just a normal t-shirt it was summer never used a chainsaw in my life and he just  like shows me how to turn it on and he's like okay this is how you turn it on two more important<br />
<strong>0:08:46-0:09:00:</strong>  things this is how you put the brake this is how you turn it off make sure you have  like a good position with your feet like that you're standing strong and just have fun and  he leaves and he leaves me there with the chainsaw by myself and like these kind of<br />
<strong>0:09:00-0:09:15:</strong>  situations would happen like very regularly where I remember where I was really high up  in an oak tree I was like 15 meters high up in an oak tree that we're pruning he had already  finished his tree which was next to mine yeah and it was the first time that I was kind<br />
<strong>0:09:15-0:09:37:</strong>  of like doing this like seriously and so I was pruning this tree and I did like two or  three mistakes I broke the window of the client's house which was not like so dramatic as it  sounds now but you know we could fix it but you know there's like this element of you<br />
<strong>0:09:37-0:09:50:</strong>  know he was not always present and you have to like be able to adapt to situations and  learn really fast yourself yeah I think that was perfect preparation for going to ernst  farm because so you have to tell us a bit about who ernst is because many people will<br />
<strong>0:09:50-0:10:04:</strong>  be like ernst but who is ernst like what is this what's this ernst guy that keeps coming  up in the conversation all right well so you know I started having lots of questions to  my teachers especially after having done this internship because they're teaching us really<br />
<strong>0:10:04-0:10:21:</strong>  conventional ideas and methods and they're just like okay we have to do more GMO we have  to focus on breeding more to make the crops more specific to threats of climate change  to water scarcity we have to be more efficient in the use of fertilizers so we can be more<br />
<strong>0:10:21-0:10:38:</strong>  sustainable in the use of them we have to dial in the use of pesticides and really target  them and I was like guys do you really think that this has a future like I am now I was  then 22 years old I'm now 26 and so I told him I was like you know when I'm 50 years<br />
<strong>0:10:38-0:10:55:</strong>  old I don't know if I will still be able to feed myself and a family from doing this kind  of stuff or if we would be able to feed humanity as you guys so loudly proclaim applying these  techniques and my teachers they couldn't ever answer me these questions with a group of<br />
<strong>0:10:55-0:11:14:</strong>  friends of mine we started this initiative it was like aside from our study program to  build a food forest next to the university there was like a big food forest movement  in the Netherlands and we kind of got inspired by that and wanted to make our own food forest<br />
<strong>0:11:14-0:11:34:</strong>  next to the university looking to plant it in a more rational and economically oriented  way okay that was one of the initial ideas and in this whole process many very special  things happen like I remember one of those moments was when we met Mark Shepherd he had<br />
<strong>0:11:34-0:11:54:</strong>  been a big inspiration at the time yeah I read his book and you know that was also like  really significant introduction to the whole subject of regenerative agriculture and agroforestry  to me at the time and you know but like I think two weeks after we got to know Mark<br />
<strong>0:11:54-0:12:15:</strong>  Shepherd we had organized this four-day visit for Ernst Gutch to visit us there in the Netherlands  and like I swear in those four days I learned more about the things that I came to university  to learn about and everything that I thought would be significant to what I wanted to achieve<br />
<strong>0:12:15-0:12:38:</strong>  in agriculture in my life than I had in the previous two years of studying and so Ernst  had like very immediate and very big impact on me and so he is the person that developed  this whole concept of syntropic agroforestry he has been yeah working on this I would say<br />
<strong>0:12:38-0:12:59:</strong>  for over 50 years I mean he grew up doing agriculture in a smallholder family farm in  Switzerland that was still applying very traditional methods and he still has very deep memories  of the crop rotations and the agroforestry systems that they had at the time so they<br />
<strong>0:12:59-0:13:16:</strong>  also had all these hedges all these windbreaks all these fruit trees overshadowing the grain  fields and everything interconnected with the livestock with the different crops and  so he still had like very he still has like very very strong memories of this that he<br />
<strong>0:13:16-0:13:36:</strong>  would also share with me and you know this very overall inspiring person he worked in  breeding afterwards and from what I understand at the time when he was working in breeding  he was working on creating clover varieties that were more productive and especially that<br />
<strong>0:13:36-0:13:59:</strong>  were more resistant to the I think it was iron toxicity in the atmosphere that was produced  by the pollution by the airplanes so something made by airplanes that was causing clover  varieties to start going weaker I don't know if this is actually really true this is something<br />
<strong>0:13:59-0:14:17:</strong>  that a friend of mine told me once I'd never heard this from the mouth of Ernst that this  was the reason why he was breeding but so he was in charge of this breeding program  for clover he went to I think he collected over 500 heritage clover varieties from different<br />
<strong>0:14:17-0:14:39:</strong>  farms in Switzerland and these clover varieties had been bred specifically to each farm for  over 500 years so the farmers would be breeding their own clover on their farm and he then  went after this 500 year selection program process to over 400 or 500 farms selected<br />
<strong>0:14:39-0:15:01:</strong>  the most beautiful clovers and made all kinds of crosses from them and out of it resulted  a clover variety which is actually still widely used here in Europe nowadays so like 40 years  later it's still being like widely used incredible and so but he started asking himself if because<br />
<strong>0:15:01-0:15:22:</strong>  of the nature of his work if it would not be more intelligent to instead of looking  for varieties and genotypes that were more resistant to the mismanagement or the mistreatment  that we were giving the plants if it would not be more intelligent to create conditions<br />
<strong>0:15:22-0:15:41:</strong>  in which the plants would feel well out of themselves so he started making a lot of experiments  with intercropping there in Switzerland he had made also some experiments with where  he had like plants inside boxes and he would like for example he would have corn and beans<br />
<strong>0:15:41-0:16:00:</strong>  and something else inside a box and he had windows where he could take away the side  of the box and look at the roots of the plants and so for example he injected colorants into  one species of plant inside that box and he could see how long it would take for that<br />
<strong>0:16:00-0:16:12:</strong>  colorant to appear in the root system of another species inside the same box and so he was  already working on the stuff in the 60s and 70s.  Wow phenomenal.<br />
<strong>0:16:12-0:16:32:</strong>  And you know he was then making a lot of connections with how plants work together and he was actually  seeing that he was having increases in yield when he would plant corn and potatoes together  that he would harvest 30% more potatoes than in a monoculture and 30% more corn and so<br />
<strong>0:16:32-0:16:55:</strong>  he was having quite some significant results and afterwards he decided to ask to leave  his job because he wanted to commit himself full time to his research in plant consortia  and agroforestry instead of continuing on the breeding.<br />
<strong>0:16:55-0:17:12:</strong>  He left his job and unfortunately, well what does it say unfortunately, well he couldn't  find a piece of land in Europe to work on because the prices were quite high at the  time and he moved with his family to Costa Rica and he was working there for six or seven<br />
<strong>0:17:12-0:17:33:</strong>  years from what I understand in the program with refugees where there were I think it  was Nicaraguan refugees that they were teaching sustainable agriculture.  Please Ernst excuse me if I say anything that is not 100% accurate but this is like how<br />
<strong>0:17:33-0:17:50:</strong>  I remember and he worked there for six or seven years and he started making these more  like simplified agroforestry systems like alley cropping.  It had like some elements of natural succession but he realized that by just making these<br />
<strong>0:17:50-0:18:09:</strong>  alley cropping systems or that by you know they were quite complex.  They had support species, they had fruit trees and then they had grain and tuber crops so  corn, beans, manioc or cassava in the in between rows.<br />
<strong>0:18:09-0:18:25:</strong>  They had bananas and other fruit trees and then support species like yeah just trees  for growing good foliage, making shade and windbreak and a supportable microclimate for  the other plants.<br />
<strong>0:18:25-0:18:42:</strong>  And he was working there on really rich soils from what I remember but he was having trouble  with the productions and he was realizing that if he wanted to continue producing in  these systems that he was never able to become independent of external inputs so that he<br />
<strong>0:18:42-0:18:57:</strong>  would have to keep adding some sort of fertilizer in order to maintain productivity.  And it's what he wrote about in his text I think he published in 1992 breakthrough in  agriculture.<br />
<strong>0:18:57-0:19:16:</strong>  He writes that that was his like main critique at himself at that point that with this alley  crop with this complex alley cropping system he still could not move away from external  inputs and he still could not achieve that which he was looking for to work solely based<br />
<strong>0:19:16-0:19:31:</strong>  on the mechanisms that we find in nature in a natural ecosystem.  After six years of this work he moved to Brazil where he bought his farm which maybe some  of you guys listening to you know parts of the story.<br />
<strong>0:19:31-0:19:50:</strong>  He bought this 500 hectare piece of land that was totally utterly degraded.  It was originally called Fazendo Olhos Dagua which means as much as farm of the eyes of  water which is a name given to farms in Brazil where they say it's the birth point of water<br />
<strong>0:19:50-0:20:08:</strong>  so it's places with a lot of dew a lot of rain and a lot of water springs.  And so it's a watershed you know very strong watershed.  But the previous owner had owned a sawmill had cut down pretty much all of the native<br />
<strong>0:20:08-0:20:25:</strong>  rainforest that was there and then had gone through this burn cycle agriculture where  they would plant cassava where they would plant different annual or biannual crops for  smallholder subsistence farming.<br />
<strong>0:20:25-0:20:41:</strong>  They had livestock and you know like these watershed areas they are very sensitive to  degradation especially areas with a lot of water springs once you start clogging up the  creeks and you get erosion like clogging up the creeks and then the water spring drying<br />
<strong>0:20:41-0:20:58:</strong>  out as a result of loss of vegetation you don't even know where the creek is anymore  than you have this really bad dynamic of drought and water logging because the water cannot  actually leave when it needs to and because there is no more vegetation that dries out<br />
<strong>0:20:58-0:21:16:</strong>  the second there is no rain.  And in the tropical soils we know that all these biological and also chemical processes  just happen on such a more rapid and accelerated rate and so his soils when he bought the farm<br />
<strong>0:21:16-0:21:34:</strong>  there was like parts where I think the majority had like pH around 4.2 but some parts even  3.8 there was like no trace of phosphorus or phosphates there was like very little nitrogen  there was almost no potassium there was toxic amounts of aluminium and also other elements<br />
<strong>0:21:34-0:21:50:</strong>  and just toxic quantities and just nothing would grow like the grasses I mean this is  like used to be a tropical rainforest with 50 meter tall trees and 2600 millimeters of  precipitation per square meter per year.<br />
<strong>0:21:50-0:22:10:</strong>  The previous owner cut down everything it started only raining 1100 millimeters after  the removal of the forest so the rainfall dropped by more than 50% and all the water  springs dried out all these chemical biological processes in the soil led to the fact that<br />
<strong>0:22:10-0:22:28:</strong>  now not even grasses will grow taller than like 10 or 15 centimeters and the previous  owner then decided to abandon the farm and they called it Fazendo dos Fugees dos Tatejas  Seca so the farm of the fugitives of the dry land.<br />
<strong>0:22:28-0:22:34:</strong>  Who named it like that?  The previous owner.  They abandoned the land and they called it that.<br />
<strong>0:22:34-0:22:52:</strong>  The name even carried the story of the degradation.  And that's the name that it's registered at as until today like if you go to the Nojiri  and like officially Ernst's farm name is called Fazendo dos Fugees dos Tatejas Seca.<br />
<strong>0:22:52-0:23:10:</strong>  So once again for you guys listening in that don't speak Portuguese it's farm of the fugitives  or refugees of the dry land because they just had to abandon it because nothing more would  grow even the most tolerant crops and so Ernst bought this farm everybody called him crazy<br />
<strong>0:23:10-0:23:25:</strong>  in the region they would they were saying like yeah nothing will ever grow there you  won't be able to even grow pineapple or cassava like nothing of this grows he got like certificates  from universities that were saying that he would never be able to grow cacao on this<br />
<strong>0:23:25-0:23:42:</strong>  farm because there's like such a low pH or like that he would never be able to grow it  in an economically viable fashion because he would just have to put so much calcium  and so much other fertilizers in order to make the production viable that he would not<br />
<strong>0:23:42-0:24:05:</strong>  be able to reach a break even point because of the price of the cost of production in  comparison to the price of the product and so he on this farm he started developing really  his techniques of centropic farming which you know he had really the idea that he carried<br />
<strong>0:24:05-0:24:27:</strong>  with him from Costa Rica that it should be possible to work on any soil on this planet  no matter how degraded it is without using any external inputs and still achieve economically  viable agricultural production and only using natural processes so he started making lots<br />
<strong>0:24:27-0:24:47:</strong>  of experience experiments on his farm his idea was that maybe even if he had to use  a one-time fertilization that in the long term he would be like he did not want to fertilize  more than one time and so he like he planted 111 hectares of cacao within the first year<br />
<strong>0:24:47-0:25:11:</strong>  and I think it was like 300 hectares of forest or something like this and he the cacao plantations  he divided into different experiments wherein some he would apply the recommended quantities  of conventional fertilizer so like the package that the green revolution was offering and<br />
<strong>0:25:11-0:25:32:</strong>  then he was also in some of the blocks he would put the recommended quantity of organic  fertilizer so same stuff but from organic origin or accepted by organic agriculture  and then the third series of attempts he was using nothing I think it was just like this<br />
<strong>0:25:32-0:25:49:</strong>  really like maybe like five percent or two percent of the recommended quantity of chalk  and he was not using it on the whole area but like I remember him telling me that in  some places he would even just use a teaspoon of chalk on the place where he would put a<br />
<strong>0:25:49-0:26:06:</strong>  cacao seed so that like when the seed would germinate it would have like something to  hold on to and to not immediately die but then it also did not obviously have the conditions  to really develop and that it would have to wait for the other plants to solve the acidity<br />
<strong>0:26:06-0:26:27:</strong>  of the soil and to raise the pH so have to wait for natural processes to occur in order  to then be able to develop and so what happened as a result of these three lines of experiment  was that the areas where he put nothing the corn like grew like three centimeters tall<br />
<strong>0:26:27-0:26:50:</strong>  and withered the beans that he had planted same thing germinated died the like they just  turned yellow they didn't even get to finish making their first true leaves and they were  gone the bananas no chance papaya no chance man yolk like growing but like weak and like<br />
<strong>0:26:50-0:27:09:</strong>  that's like for the short cycle crops then in the field with the conventional fertilizer  he had like huge corn production huge bean production bananas developing super beautiful  papaya developing super beautiful and after three months so like somewhere after the corn<br />
<strong>0:27:09-0:27:24:</strong>  harvest this huge plummet in productivity and like all the cacao trees died many of  the other fruit trees he had seeded so he plants everything by seed right most of those  trees all died and those are the areas like the field where you and me worked you know<br />
<strong>0:27:24-0:27:40:</strong>  that that was like a forest that he had he had then worked on it again afterwards but  it had no cacao trees because of this reason because it was one of those fields where he  had used come yeah salt fertilizer or chemical fertilizer and he just had no cacao trees<br />
<strong>0:27:40-0:27:57:</strong>  there it was just other trees that had come up and in the field of the organic fertilization  it was pretty much the same thing just that it took a bit longer and the effect was less  severe like maybe a bit less corn production and bean production a bit less of a spike<br />
<strong>0:27:57-0:28:17:</strong>  in the beginning but also like a less extreme plummet in the end maybe not such a severe  die of like like all of the cacao trees like maybe let's say like five percent or eight  percent survived but you know also like he was not able to establish his cacao trees<br />
<strong>0:28:17-0:28:37:</strong>  like this in the field where he had done nothing within three years his cacao trees grew like  30 centimeters tall i think he said and so in the beginning was very hard and it was  there where he then started developing this technique which he also describes in this<br />
<strong>0:28:37-0:28:54:</strong>  text breakthrough in agriculture which he calls selective weeding which is not really  a weeding as such but it's more like a selective pruning and some plants he actually does weed  but it's really just a few and so he was looking for the plants that were spontaneously coming<br />
<strong>0:28:54-0:29:13:</strong>  up and then periodically he would go through all the fields and with his machete selectively  cut out all the plants that were at the end of the flowering and so you know like in his  theory when the plants reach this morphological ripeness when they finish flowering and they<br />
<strong>0:29:13-0:29:30:</strong>  start maturing their seeds so going towards physiological ripeness they start already  entering into a state of senescence that has the impact on all the other plants in the  surroundings and so he always when there's a plant that enters into this kind of state<br />
<strong>0:29:30-0:29:47:</strong>  he always goes to prune it in order to either reset its life cycle so it re-sprouts with  renewed vigor and by then you know you have to imagine that it's like waves you know like  first the plant grows up and it reaches a certain point and it starts flowering then<br />
<strong>0:29:47-0:30:05:</strong>  if you prune it it already has a root system established it already has its associated  microbiology and all of these things you prune it it grows back stronger and it reaches a  new height so a new higher wave is created and this you know this pruning process it's<br />
<strong>0:30:05-0:30:29:</strong>  also something we learned in university it's mostly apical pruning so removing the top  growth points of the plants has a very significant impact on the plant on a hormonal level so  you basically shift the whole hormone hormonal balance within the plant because in the top<br />
<strong>0:30:29-0:30:47:</strong>  in the tips of the plant is where a certain hormone called auxin is produced and that's  really promoting this apical growth with the central leader suppressing the side branches  from growing too strongly and growing up and it's actually kind of you know in that sense<br />
<strong>0:30:47-0:31:04:</strong>  limiting the speed of growth you know the second you remove that on a tree you know  you would remove the top and then proportionally prune back all the side branches so that you  don't just apically prune the top like they do here in Portugal they you know they just<br />
<strong>0:31:04-0:31:18:</strong>  climb up a tree they knock out the top and then they leave all the side branches and  there's these poor trees then standing there but you know you climb up you knock out the  top and then you knock out all the side branches proportionally so that the tree maintains<br />
<strong>0:31:18-0:31:38:</strong>  the same shape same exact shape before and after it's just proportionally reduced and  so all the branches are apically pruned what happens is there's no more source of auxin  and there's two hormones produced in the root system cytokinin and gibberellic acid which<br />
<strong>0:31:38-0:31:59:</strong>  are huge growth enhancing hormones under the influence of these hormones a plant will portray  much higher cell division rate much higher velocity of photosynthesis more photosynthesis  means more water being cycled or recycled you know in Ernst theory he doesn't really<br />
<strong>0:31:59-0:32:16:</strong>  believe that all plants drink water from the soil but that it's a cycle where they actually  with the do they create water and they due to temperature differences I mean it's also  goes back to Victor Schauberger which if any of you listening are interested in Ernst's<br />
<strong>0:32:16-0:32:37:</strong>  work I highly suggest you to start studying Victor Schauberger there are some really nice  works about his work by a man called Callum Coates and the book living energy is like  living energies is really like the most all encompassing description of Victor Schauberger's<br />
<strong>0:32:37-0:32:56:</strong>  work which you know like reading these books was also really helping me understand where  what Ernst was talking about because you know it's really just an in-depth comprehensive  understanding of how nature actually works like not how modern science belief nature<br />
<strong>0:32:56-0:33:16:</strong>  works not how modern physicists believe that nature works but how nature and the cosmos  actually works so you see that there is like the understanding of Ernst and yours as well  there's a big disparity between modern understanding of how plants and natural systems work and<br />
<strong>0:33:16-0:33:31:</strong>  how things actually work you see that there's a big difference yeah I mean for sure I mean  the biggest one that surprises people all the time that come here the first one like  I said is like don't these plants drink so much water because I have so many plants so<br />
<strong>0:33:31-0:33:43:</strong>  close together and people are like how are you managing like aren't they competition  is like that's the first one like drinking water the second one competition like that  just blows people out of the water is like what like you don't believe that plants compete<br />
<strong>0:33:43-0:34:03:</strong>  with each other because you know like I have thousands of plants here in my plant in my  farm to give you guys an idea listening I have about 70,000 trees planted on one and  a half no one point three hectares and so that gives me about seven trees per square<br />
<strong>0:34:03-0:34:23:</strong>  meter and you know I haven't planted the whole fields it's all in rows and sometimes on the  space of like 10 square centimeters there's like 10 trees growing out of it and there's  this one water dropper and I'm irrigating very little for the climate in which I am<br />
<strong>0:34:23-0:34:42:</strong>  here and you know I always tell people I was like that have this doubt I just tell them  I was like alright so I want you to go around my farm and show me an example where you see  a plant suffering because of another one or like one plant competing with another one<br />
<strong>0:34:42-0:34:57:</strong>  because you don't see that you see the complete opposite you see how they nurture each other  how they raise each other how they improve the conditions for each other and that is  you know I always explain it like this if you know how to work with plants I think that's<br />
<strong>0:34:57-0:35:15:</strong>  just really like the basis of this work is like really understanding how to work with  plants descending off of the pedestal as Ernest always says so like descending off of our  throne of thinking that we're like the supreme being the intelligent ones but to understand<br />
<strong>0:35:15-0:35:37:</strong>  that we are part of this intelligent system that we don't over pose ourselves to the will  of the plants but that we sort of say tune in to their desires and to their needs and  then from that perspective seek to optimize this whole system and giving each plant its<br />
<strong>0:35:37-0:35:55:</strong>  correct conditions in comparison to all the other ones around it and the second that you  understand and know how to work with plants in such a sense that you know through pruning  through selective weeding through selective pruning you can optimize the shade conditions<br />
<strong>0:35:55-0:36:12:</strong>  the I actually don't believe in shade I don't have shade in my farm I have filtered sunlight  you know there exists no shade here it's just filtered sunlight and so like I plant citrus  trees and people tell me but do citrus trees grow in shade I say I don't know I plant them<br />
<strong>0:36:12-0:36:35:</strong>  in filtered sunlight and I see a big difference in their health being in filtered sunlight  in comparison to direct sunlight and so you know the second you understand how to work  with these plants together and optimizing this process there's no more conflicts and<br />
<strong>0:36:35-0:36:57:</strong>  the only way that you might be able to like where I feel like man got this idea of competition  from is when you look at nature and when you look at the natural like occurrence of plants  that might not be managed and it might not be maintained by a person with this understanding<br />
<strong>0:36:57-0:37:18:</strong>  or by anybody at all you know it might just be let grown wildly and so people then think  this is competition because this plant is like suffocating this one but I actually just  believe it's conflicts that arise out of mismanagement or no management and also in that sense you<br />
<strong>0:37:18-0:37:45:</strong>  know ernsti always says there's no competition there's only co-definition so no competition  but co-definition all the different plants they together co-co-decide who is the most  adapted the most strong like who is the genome like imagine there's a hundred oak trees growing<br />
<strong>0:37:45-0:38:03:</strong>  all together on the space that in the future one oak tree would grow in the beginning you  know all of them are serving a function because they're occupying that area you know like  one of the big ideas of some tropic farming is that occupy the maximum of potential space<br />
<strong>0:38:03-0:38:21:</strong>  from with photosynthesis in all stages of development of your plantation so you want  to always have the whole place full of photosynthesis and in the beginning you can allow yourself  to have that many trees there making a deep taproot into the soil working the soil mobilizing<br />
<strong>0:38:21-0:38:45:</strong>  microbiology because the space just allows it and they together then will co-decide who  is the most adapted genotype to this exact location and that one will be indicated by  portraying more vigor by portraying more strength but sometimes it's really surprising it's<br />
<strong>0:38:45-0:39:03:</strong>  not even the plants that are growing fastest in the beginning that end up staying and you  know you just really have to be able to tune in and understand which plant is now meant  to go and which plant is meant to stay which is very difficult concept to explain to people<br />
<strong>0:39:03-0:39:22:</strong>  and I think the only way that I have somehow started learning how to relate to plants on  this level is by having planted them myself and taking care of my own agroforestry system  over a few years now where you have this connection with the plant from the beginning you know<br />
<strong>0:39:22-0:39:37:</strong>  and a lot of times actually the animals will come and take out the plants so rodents or  other animals they come and take them out like the oak trees if I cut them with my scissors  they will sprout back no matter what so I cannot take them out but the mice they will<br />
<strong>0:39:37-0:39:53:</strong>  go and cut the root of the weaker ones and that's very interesting so ernstee after three  years his cacao trees were still very small and he developed this technique of selective  weeding and selective pruning where he was pruning the plants that were flowering by<br />
<strong>0:39:53-0:40:10:</strong>  five years he started noticing a big difference because spontaneous trees and also trees that  he had planted himself that were adapted to the conditions of the site had significantly  developed and he could start pruning them then he started seeing a big shift in the<br />
<strong>0:40:10-0:40:29:</strong>  dynamics of the place and the cacao trees started growing very fast and then by eight  years he started having production and these are now the orchards that 35-36 years later  are still highly productive and that are producing the cacao that he and him and his family are<br />
<strong>0:40:29-0:40:51:</strong>  living from in the beginning what he ended up using as an economic production to pay  off his farm and to pay the salaries of his workers and pay for his livelihood was bananas  he was dehydrating bananas.<br />
<strong>0:40:51-0:41:09:</strong>  I just want to put that and nowadays he's producing on average about three times more  cacao per hectare per year than the average Brazilian conventional farmer that uses the  whole package of fungicides, herbicides, fertilizers and so on and so forth.<br />
<strong>0:41:09-0:41:18:</strong>  It's not just this it's when you've tasted his cacao.  I know like it's something else isn't it?  To all of you guys listening Dimitri and me we're sitting here right now both with the<br />
<strong>0:41:18-0:41:34:</strong>  cup full of urns cacao and it just brings very special atmosphere.  Tell us a bit more about this thing of pruning and organic matter which is so representative  of syntropic agriculture and this is what you're saying is the next phase in which you<br />
<strong>0:41:34-0:41:45:</strong>  went.  Maybe explain a bit more what that means.  What really brings the productivity into the system is as you said the pruning and it's<br />
<strong>0:41:45-0:42:02:</strong>  you know always I was reading through my notes from when I was at urns farm the other day  by coincidence I think it was actually before I knew that we would do this interview and  I'd written down that a syntropic plantation works in six dimensions.<br />
<strong>0:42:02-0:42:13:</strong>  So it's a six dimensional entity.  Maybe now I would say it's seven.  Anyways you have the first three dimensions which is space.<br />
<strong>0:42:13-0:42:28:</strong>  How plants are arranged in space.  This is how the different plants grow above and below each other and next to each other.  So stratification, layering, it's a very big part of the syntropic agriculture approach<br />
<strong>0:42:28-0:42:48:</strong>  where you really attempt to fit each plant into its optimal position.  Ernst and his son Tancred they studied the Brazilian rainforest in many different places  of Brazil and they came to the conclusion that there's 11 strata in the forest.<br />
<strong>0:42:48-0:43:14:</strong>  So you have emergent, canopy to emergent, then canopy convex, canopy concave, medium  to canopy, medium to canopy, then medium to canopy, then you have medium, then medium  to low, then low, then there's a herbaceous layer and then the regeneration layer which<br />
<strong>0:43:14-0:43:25:</strong>  are all the trees that will make part of the next, like that are being raised underneath  the forest.  The fourth dimension that ties in with all of this is time.<br />
<strong>0:43:25-0:43:40:</strong>  Which as I said there's a regeneration layer and you know like some plants they live shorter,  some plants they live longer.  You plant this whole spectrum of different species that are from different life cycles.<br />
<strong>0:43:40-0:43:52:</strong>  So that's the fourth dimension is time.  The fifth dimension is the interaction between all these different species that exist within  the plantation.<br />
<strong>0:43:52-0:44:13:</strong>  So you know like here on my farm when I first started it's very much research focused so  I also did this to understand what really works here on this land but I was planting  about 80 species per row together which had all kinds of herbaceous and short cycle vegetable<br />
<strong>0:44:13-0:44:30:</strong>  plants but then also long-lived trees.  The sixth dimension is dynamic which is strongly driven by the human intervention into the  ecosystem and that's where the pruning comes in.<br />
<strong>0:44:30-0:44:56:</strong>  The pruning, like our main objective in pruning is to optimize the natural processes occurring  on the site principally photosynthesis and natural succession of species.  So the natural succession of species in the beginning you know we start by planting.<br />
<strong>0:44:56-0:45:16:</strong>  Imagine you have different life cycles of different plants.  The first life cycle would be your vegetable crops like radishes, melons, corn, beans,  sweet potatoes that grow together in this short life cycle and they sort of produce<br />
<strong>0:45:16-0:45:35:</strong>  a macroorganism between each other.  They are the ones that start to create, well they produce this macroorganism where each  one of them is fulfilling a unique function in regards to the other ones and one of their<br />
<strong>0:45:35-0:46:04:</strong>  functions that they are fulfilling is to as I said before cover the maximum amount of  area with photosynthesis on immediate time frame but also through their metabolism they  are changing the qualities of the site climatically so they are starting to modulate the microclimate,<br />
<strong>0:46:04-0:46:17:</strong>  they are raising the humidity, lowering the temperature but then also biologically and  chemically so they are starting to produce accidents through their roots that start feeding  microbiology.<br />
<strong>0:46:17-0:46:35:</strong>  This microbiology then in turn starts mobilizing different nutrients and well trace minerals  and all kinds of stuff naturally and I think that this is really the only way that you  can get this stuff back into the soil because you know like here where I live in the top<br />
<strong>0:46:35-0:46:58:</strong>  soil we are like imagine lacking like pretty much all the trace elements you could imagine  there is like manganese, magnesium, phosphate, calcium, boron, copper, plus sulfur, plus  a number of other things just completely missing from the top soil but you know the trees here<br />
<strong>0:46:58-0:47:15:</strong>  they can make roots that go 80 meters deep and I believe that through these natural processes  is how we can actually sustainably create this balance in the soil again that putting  rock dust or stuff like this is not a solution because they will oxidize and chemically bind<br />
<strong>0:47:15-0:47:26:</strong>  up with other elements in the same process that the ones did that were originally here  due to the degradation of the land.  It's like symptomatic it's not actually solving the core problem which is the lack of life<br />
<strong>0:47:26-0:47:44:</strong>  in the soil, lack of organic matter, lack of cycle, shade, all these things that this  complex microorganism which is an agroecological system which is and this is what's fascinating  with Centropic Ag is that they're really you guys are really attempting here to solve the<br />
<strong>0:47:44-0:47:57:</strong>  issue from the port from what is actually wrong with the machine that we're trying to  solve it's not a machine it's a bad metaphor but the system the organism solve it reactivate  it.<br />
<strong>0:47:57-0:48:14:</strong>  When you guys are solving that issue you're going you're doing really deep biomimicry  like from all the agricultural systems that I know Centropic Agriculture is the one that  goes as close to nature which is the one that is most intimately biomimic in nature.<br />
<strong>0:48:14-0:48:24:</strong>  No for sure.  As close to them right?  You know like that's why I found so much enthusiasm in working together with Ernst because he<br />
<strong>0:48:24-0:48:49:</strong>  is just like you know it's it feels so true so profoundly true what he is working on and  what he is doing and it has like such a deep meaning to you know our planet in my point  of view you know it really affected me very deeply on a soul level and you know it obvious<br />
<strong>0:48:49-0:49:06:</strong>  like so to continue that conversation you know like you then have this first microorganism  of short life cycle plants that kind of starts altering the conditions of the site of intervention  and then later on like they through through their metabolism and through the alterations<br />
<strong>0:49:06-0:49:27:</strong>  which they cause on the site of intervention they produce the conditions for the plants  of the next life cycle so the next macroorganism to successfully be able to establish without  the work of these we don't call them pioneer plants we don't call them biomass plants because<br />
<strong>0:49:27-0:49:43:</strong>  calling them pioneer plants would mean that they're like something external or something  like of lesser value you know they are not external they all make part of the same system  they just are part of a different life cycle they're not pioneering anything you know it's<br />
<strong>0:49:43-0:49:59:</strong>  like you know when there's an embryo being created inside the mother's womb there's no  the stem cells are not pioneer cells they're stem cells that's what everything else builds  up from you know there is no pioneers in that sense they all make part of the same system<br />
<strong>0:49:59-0:50:20:</strong>  at just at different stages and then the also no biomass plants so we have no plant in the  system that we intentionally integrate in order to produce biomass we look for plants  that are able to vigorously grow under the conditions of the site and are able to react<br />
<strong>0:50:20-0:50:37:</strong>  well to strong pruning but that is not with the objective to create biomass i mean it's  the biomass production is like a sub product and i think that's where like a lot of people  get ernest wrong because you know he never goes to prune a tree with the intention to<br />
<strong>0:50:37-0:50:53:</strong>  bring down organic material he prunes the trees in order to optimize them in their crown  shape in their like in the amount of filtered sunlight that they make or the amount of sun  filtration that they create in order to optimize that with all the other plants that exist<br />
<strong>0:50:53-0:51:11:</strong>  around it you know and he really looks at it from this perspective and what's interesting  is the second you start doing it like this you will always have the perfect amount of  organic material to cover the soil completely like you won't have too much you won't have<br />
<strong>0:51:11-0:51:33:</strong>  too little if you like invest it well you'll be able to cover 100% of the area with like  in his farm like 3 to 5 cm layer of fresh organic material without like over pruning  the plants just by pruning them the right amount that is necessary for the optimization<br />
<strong>0:51:33-0:52:01:</strong>  of the system and so you know like then the and the pruning in like let me so you have  these different life cycles and how they succeed each other is how we build up this forest  and how one life cycle transitions into the next is a large part of what we call dynamics<br />
<strong>0:52:01-0:52:26:</strong>  of the ecosystem and to fortify these dynamics we use techniques such as pruning and the  pruning has one very strong impact which is as i was mentioning earlier the reset of growth  cycles of plants and the reinvigoration of plants so bringing plants to a higher level<br />
<strong>0:52:26-0:52:46:</strong>  then they would go without pruning and this in urn's theory as all plants are connected  via mycorrhiza when one plant in the system or two plants in the system are experiencing  this state of accelerated and invigorated growth due to pruning and when they are cycling<br />
<strong>0:52:46-0:53:06:</strong>  all the cytokine and gibberellic acid that they actually transmit this through the mycorrhiza  to other plants and i've actively seen this happen on his farm where i was pruning elephant  grass which i planted together with my corn and my beans and my young trees i prune it<br />
<strong>0:53:06-0:53:23:</strong>  and my cacao trees are like 10 centimeters tall and have these tiny little leaves the  second i prune it a week later the cacao trees have like 30 centimeter long leaves all of  a sudden they're like drooping down on the floor and they've like they were like stopped<br />
<strong>0:53:23-0:53:37:</strong>  before they were not growing and i prune the elephant grass and the cacao trees just make  this huge push making really big leaves and you see it in urn's forest you know the in  the region a normal cacao tree makes like leaves that are like 20 to 30 centimeters<br />
<strong>0:53:37-0:53:56:</strong>  long in his forest i remember him coming up to us with like leaves that were 60 or 70  centimeters big and so it makes very big difference this that's without any fertilizers nothing  he has never used anything never on most of his active plantations you know most of the<br />
<strong>0:53:56-0:54:16:</strong>  places where he actually harvests cacao where he is able to produce he never fertilized  and those are his best plantations very interesting maybe you tell us a bit more about because  you referred a few times to your farm and where you're working here in portugal maybe<br />
<strong>0:54:16-0:54:34:</strong>  you can tell us a bit about how you how you know you're applying what you learned with  urn's and and how all this all this incredible journey you've just explained to us how that  led to pinta da sabelias and and your story kind of in portugal i still feel like i haven't<br />
<strong>0:54:34-0:54:58:</strong>  i we've talked a lot about centropic farming but i still don't feel like i've actually  given like a real like definition of what it is so um i think the number one thing to  centropic farming is to mimic the natural ecosystem of the site of intervention in its<br />
<strong>0:54:58-0:55:15:</strong>  structure function and dynamic as closely as possible so structure is referring to the  stratification the dynamic to the different life cycles the dynamic between the different  seasons but then also the dynamic that exists between when the plantation is pruned and<br />
<strong>0:55:15-0:55:42:</strong>  when it's not pruned so like light and shade or light and filtered sunlight amounts of  sunlight in the plantation and then function refers to anything from nutrient cycling to  water cycling and so on and so forth and the next point is that the plantations should<br />
<strong>0:55:42-0:56:04:</strong>  work without any external inputs that the biggest external input that we use is our  knowledge of sociology of plants so how plants behave towards each other and with each other  and how to optimize ecological processes as well another external input is the planting<br />
<strong>0:56:04-0:56:26:</strong>  material in some cases we like ernst he uses almost exclusively seeds he i've like while  i was in his farm i never planted a single plant there's always seeds directly in the  ground even i mean in his farm even tomatoes i was planting directly on the spot i wasn't<br />
<strong>0:56:26-0:56:53:</strong>  making a nursery for anything and so you know like that's a big part of the thing that ideally  if you adhere to really what's the tropic farming is you don't use any seedlings or  grafted plants the third part is that the plantations are able to mobilize and recycle<br />
<strong>0:56:53-0:57:22:</strong>  so mobilize and transform and then recycle their own nutrient and water necessities and  a big part is also that the plantation should be economically viable and profitable but  even more importantly that it is profitable in a sense of natural capital or as ernst<br />
<strong>0:57:22-0:57:43:</strong>  calls it the quality quantity and quality of consolidated life on the site so that it  has a significant increase in quantity and quality of consolidated life on the site but  that it also positively contributes in the same sense to the macro organism planet earth<br />
<strong>0:57:43-0:58:03:</strong>  as a whole so you know like here for example on my farm i'm having a positive impact on  the system on the site by bringing straw from a neighbor i'm enriching i'm giving conditions  for life to work here by bringing in this moat is not completely aligned with the centropic<br />
<strong>0:58:03-0:58:20:</strong>  principles because by doing this i might not be having entirely positive benefit to the  macro organism planet earth as a whole by taking nutrients and organic matter from another  site exactly because you're having a negative impact on another site in order to enrich<br />
<strong>0:58:20-0:58:42:</strong>  your own site another aspect is that we don't consider anything to be a pest or a disease  all of the animals all of the bugs all of these different interveners and cohabitants  of our forests are endobionts of the forest just as ourselves and that they make part<br />
<strong>0:58:42-0:59:02:</strong>  of the department or the agency of optimization of life processes so they will only start  to intervene when we have not managed to put a plant in its right context in the right  conditions and you see this in urns farm all the time and here in my own farm i also i've<br />
<strong>0:59:02-0:59:25:</strong>  never had any animal or bug or critter intervene with my crops where i could not reason or  figure out through reason why it had come why that because it usually comes if you're  open to it it will tell you immediately what you did wrong and it's you know they are lesson<br />
<strong>0:59:25-0:59:43:</strong>  givers and they are so say teachers for us to be able to optimize or better understand  nature and the ecosystem and how to better intervene with our plantations and how to  better cultivate our tree crops instead of looking at them as something evil that's coming<br />
<strong>0:59:43-1:00:07:</strong>  to punish us we could look at them as teachers and how to better treat our plants there's  one more element that is about some traffic farming that right now i'm not coming up with  so we'll skip that and yeah so here my farm after having lived in urns farm for over one<br />
<strong>1:00:07-1:00:25:</strong>  year i did an internship here in portugal on the agricultural estate at that duffrech  new mail which at the time was working together with urns to install different agroforestry  fields around the estate some more intensively managed closer to the main production sites<br />
<strong>1:00:25-1:00:47:</strong>  to the living areas some more extensive areas in large fields where they were trying to  reforest 100 hectare big really degraded field and i came to do an internship here for my  university and to kind of help prepare things for a workshop that urns was going to give<br />
<strong>1:00:47-1:01:08:</strong>  here and during this time you know i just really fell in love with the ecosystem with  the area i always felt like i wanted to work and live in europe that i didn't want to go  to brazil but mostly for the reason that i you know there was already so much going on<br />
<strong>1:01:08-1:01:27:</strong>  there and i felt like the whole knowledge of urns that there was very little being like  very like nobody was strictly following his ideas really here in europe you know like  there's people applying techniques and principles of syntropic farming in some cases but i really<br />
<strong>1:01:27-1:01:49:</strong>  wanted to apply as much of it as i could and really do things as i'd seen on his farm which  i'll get to in a minute is you know i am not i have not entirely managed to live up to  that standard either i think it's good to be honest about that i don't consider what<br />
<strong>1:01:49-1:02:09:</strong>  i do here really syntropic farming if i would look at it from a puristic standpoint you  know because a number of the principles that i had mentioned earlier are just not fulfilled  you know the first one is that as i said i do use external inputs like straw or organic<br />
<strong>1:02:09-1:02:31:</strong>  material that i bring in from neighbors most of it i would say 95 of all the organic material  i bring into the farm are actually trash and byproducts of different production chains  from neighbors like for example i bring in a lot of rotten wood from one a firewood processing<br />
<strong>1:02:31-1:02:45:</strong>  company here close by so when they split up the firewood all these little bits of wood  fall off and the bark and the mosses and it just creates this marvelous black soil because  it just sits there forever and then there's all these little pieces of wood that are all<br />
<strong>1:02:45-1:03:03:</strong>  like covered in fungi and everything and i bring that in because as a supplement to my  soil and there's a neighbor that has a lot of he has a horse stable and nobody in the  area in the region here wants to use his horse manure because he mixes it with wood chips<br />
<strong>1:03:03-1:03:22:</strong>  and people here are used to plowing the manure under and leaving the soil uncovered and obviously  you shouldn't plow under manure like this it will do bad for your soil because it's  very rich in carbon and much less rich in nitrogen and is not decomposed and so i use<br />
<strong>1:03:22-1:03:44:</strong>  this a lot because it comes very cheap and is very is my cheapest way of covering the  soil organic material and then the other product that i do use is hay from a neighbor he has  yeah i think he has about two or three hundred cows and he has this extensive grazing operation<br />
<strong>1:03:44-1:04:04:</strong>  and every year they make a large number of hay bales and he has had last year and this  year a lot of bales that were rotten because they've been exposed to the weather and he  sells them to me for very cheap and for me it's perfect because i just shred them up<br />
<strong>1:04:04-1:04:20:</strong>  with the mulcher that goes behind the tractor and then it's kind of like shredded hay the  seeds are already not viable anymore because the hay is really old and it's been exposed  to the weather and so in this anaerobic decomposition that occurs inside the bale the seeds become<br />
<strong>1:04:20-1:04:43:</strong>  inviolable i have no more weeds coming from the hay and it's much cheaper than if i buy  fresh hay or straw and i do also use a lot of seedlings here in my farm and i do use  in limited quantities irrigation so these are like you know the main elements where<br />
<strong>1:04:43-1:05:01:</strong>  i would say that i'm not like entirely centropic and then also i'm just a question why are  you doing it this way in that case if it's not purely centropic what are the reasons  that are pushing you towards using these these inputs the straw and the stuff the irrigation<br />
<strong>1:05:01-1:05:23:</strong>  as well just understand what's the you know strategy behind that there's a different number  of reasons first of all you know i'm doing a research farm here and you know i have mostly  like research objectives and for me it's also you know as this is the nature of the farm<br />
<strong>1:05:23-1:05:44:</strong>  the economic model behind it for the past two and a half years has been mostly been  relying on funding and you know i i myself working so hard for planting all these agroforestry  systems i want to see things develop and i want myself to see myself here inside a forest<br />
<strong>1:05:44-1:06:07:</strong>  within a reasonable time span and also i want to show some kind of results to my funders  and if you would look back at the list of materials that i told you that i use there's  nothing in there that is like a fast decomposing so to say organic fertilizer it's all like<br />
<strong>1:06:07-1:06:30:</strong>  imagine like whole grain cereals for the soil you know it's like whole grain food it's uh  integral and so you know um when you have in centropic farming we also don't believe  in decomposition or as people would call it compost we don't generally don't i mean there's<br />
<strong>1:06:30-1:06:50:</strong>  i don't you know believe anymore in these dogmas i used to be like very strict about  what i wanted to do or not want to do you know i work with the resources i have available  to me and compost has this funny thing that it's a lot of organic material that plants<br />
<strong>1:06:50-1:07:15:</strong>  work very hard to complexify all this solar and cosmic energy into their plant structure  into their like the plant fibers making all these sugars and these yeah this beautiful  magnificent being and if we then take that and put that into a compost which is a exothermic<br />
<strong>1:07:15-1:07:38:</strong>  reaction so it heats up and inside this heating up process a lot of these energies are actually  being sent back out into the universe so it's a entropic reaction in the end and what we  usually do is we apply any kind of organic material as fresh as possible directly to<br />
<strong>1:07:38-1:08:00:</strong>  the place where we planted at the feet of our plants and let that process occur on site  and there are specific ways in which we arrange the organic material so that it doesn't get  hot and that leads to the fact that you actually have a reaction that cools down the place<br />
<strong>1:08:00-1:08:19:</strong>  so here my farm you know last year we had this weather station running and you could  see that while in the control fields the soil temperature 10 cm below soil level was 38  degrees at the peak of the day here my farm was only 21 and you see that's a very big<br />
<strong>1:08:19-1:08:40:</strong>  difference for a plant root system for the microbiology for the fungi for the bacteria  in this kind of really harsh climate where temperatures go 42-44 degrees and the like  drought period is 4-5 months and the rains are getting more and more unpredictable<br />
<strong>1:08:40-1:08:59:</strong>  you can't tell us this and not tell us how you layer the organic matter  well you have to it's kind of like imagine like those windrows that the tractors make  when they pile up the hay so it has like one pile where it's like a pile that's high on<br />
<strong>1:08:59-1:09:17:</strong>  the center and then it falls off to the sides imagine if you would do two of those right  next to each other so you would have two piles that are high on top and then fall off towards  the sides and just where those two piles meet where the organic material is like let's say<br />
<strong>1:09:17-1:09:39:</strong>  like only 5 or 10 cm thick and then on the outsides you know you have like the 30-40  cm thick organic material in the center is where you have the plants and so what happens  is that it actually draws humidity and cold air it creates this how's it called a thermal<br />
<strong>1:09:39-1:10:00:</strong>  current that brings the fresher air and the humidity towards the center towards the plant  and yeah so I don't I didn't want to get into explaining it because I think it's hard to  visualize without like a physical example yeah yeah no but all of these techniques that<br />
<strong>1:10:00-1:10:18:</strong>  you're talking about they require or imagine like if you if you just plant a single tree  or like a group of trees one of the things you know we don't call make we don't plant  a tree in a hole in some tropic farming like ernest is always very explicit about the fact<br />
<strong>1:10:18-1:10:41:</strong>  that a hole is for the people and that a nest is for the trees so it's a place of creation  a place of birth cradle so to say and with this parable made when you have one of these  nests the best way to organize the organic material around it is exactly in the shape<br />
<strong>1:10:41-1:10:58:</strong>  of a bird's nest so this kind of circle that's high on the outside and then at the center  where the trees are maybe three to five centimeters thick so just because of the shape of the  way it's organized you're seeing like a big impact of course on temperatures as compared<br />
<strong>1:10:58-1:11:15:</strong>  to just layering mulch kind of in whichever way yeah because you know if you make this  single pile with all the mulch organized just in one thing if you would plant the trees  on the center of that first of all their trunks would rot away yeah for sure second you are<br />
<strong>1:11:15-1:11:40:</strong>  creating a heat driven reaction which sends energy back to the universe we in some tropic  farming you know we attempt to use the natural capital given to us to trigger transformative  processes that lead to a growth in capital on the site and improvement of life conditions<br />
<strong>1:11:40-1:12:03:</strong>  for all consolidated beings on that site so you know that's why I said we don't believe  in decomposition or in compost because when we apply these fresh whole organic materials  to the soil they are not decomposed but they are being transformed into higher life forms<br />
<strong>1:12:03-1:12:24:</strong>  which is a chain reaction of one life form eating the other one eating the other one  eating the other one and that is leading to the fact of improving and raising the life  conditions on that place so that more demanding trees or plants can grow so here in my project<br />
<strong>1:12:24-1:12:48:</strong>  I started working here almost three years ago it's based in this agricultural estate  at that Lufthansa where they allowed me the privilege to purchase a parcel of their property  or Alfredo the owner of the land he allowed me the privilege to purchase a part of his<br />
<strong>1:12:48-1:13:07:</strong>  lands a part of his inheritance in order to realize my dream in order to realize my project  of living here of cultivating this land and reforesting it and so I started with principally  three objectives you know when I came back from Ernst's farm I told you this the other<br />
<strong>1:13:07-1:13:26:</strong>  day you know I was looking to deepen my knowledge about plants about agriculture and so I bought  a lot of books about food forest about agroforestry about organic agriculture all this kind of  stuff and I started reading it I'm like hey like all of this stuff does not actually align<br />
<strong>1:13:26-1:13:43:</strong>  with that what Ernst was telling me like they're talking about competition they're talking  about you know all these kind of things and I don't feel that this is actually it's all  very honorable work and I don't want to say it's not valuable it's very valuable but you<br />
<strong>1:13:43-1:14:03:</strong>  know I was I wanted to tune in to this truth that I felt from Ernst's this deep understanding  of how nature actually works you know and so instead of studying continued study agriculture  I bought like all kinds of books about philosophy and if you look at my library now like most<br />
<strong>1:14:03-1:14:23:</strong>  of it's like Cicero, Marcus Aurelius, Plato all kinds of stuff from ancient Egypt and  you know that's really what started fascinating me and one of the big things that started  fascinating me about these texts is the way that they describe the Mediterranean ecosystem<br />
<strong>1:14:23-1:14:44:</strong>  that they found when they had first come here so in like the ancient Greek texts you know  there's like the example of Kritius and Timaeus from Plato where Plato is describing how Athens  looked 12,000 years ago based on current like time counting was like a historical account<br />
<strong>1:14:44-1:15:06:</strong>  that he had received from Egyptian priest and so I mean there's a story where they also  it's a bit of a controversial story because it's also the same text where they describe  Atlantis they it's like pretty much there's this guy Solon who had later on been like<br />
<strong>1:15:06-1:15:26:</strong>  a dictator that the state of Greece voluntarily elected because they believed he was the only  one that could save the state of calamity that was occurring in Greece he was very wise  man and he had studied in Egypt and he was getting in this discussion with the ancient<br />
<strong>1:15:26-1:15:53:</strong>  Egyptian priest about how the Greeks knew everything about history and he starts relating  like how forget the name of the guy was the name of the his son of Apollo and he asked  his father Apollo to let him or Helios to drive the Sun chariot and so when he got on<br />
<strong>1:15:53-1:16:11:</strong>  the Sun chariot he couldn't drive it and he got off course and he crashed it and it burned  the face of the earth and that was one of the moments according and so the Solon he  starts relating these stories to the priest and then the priest goes yes you tell these<br />
<strong>1:16:11-1:16:26:</strong>  stories very good and also the story of the flood you know this very good and your people  very honorable because you still remember these events but here in Egypt we have never  suffered from fire that erased our knowledge because we are living in the desert and we<br />
<strong>1:16:26-1:16:43:</strong>  have never suffered from flood that erased our civilization and our knowledge because  there's no rain here and we still remember that there was not just one fire or one flood  but that there was many other ones before and so he starts telling about how there was<br />
<strong>1:16:43-1:17:02:</strong>  a civilization living in Athens 10,000 years before Plato lived and he is describing the  ecosystem and the water springs and all the stuff that was there so I mean like it's like  for modern historians it's a bit of a dubious story but you know it just fascinated me like<br />
<strong>1:17:02-1:17:21:</strong>  how they describe the Mediterranean ecosystem and there's much more explicit examples of  where they actually describe how their ecosystem look like and then we also obviously have  the the pollen evidence you know from the depths of lakes and other places where the<br />
<strong>1:17:21-1:17:38:</strong>  pollen just accumulated that show us that these were very diverse deciduous forests  I've read research on the pollen it's called the name of it is this type of work do you  remember what they call it it's crazy and they can go back from the studies I was seeing<br />
<strong>1:17:38-1:17:57:</strong>  they went back up to 8,000 years ago and they've connected the pollen findings with the archaeological  findings yeah and you can see exactly where the man cut down the forest exactly and they  aligned it with so the arrival of dust of fire different layers and the changes in the<br />
<strong>1:17:57-1:18:12:</strong>  50 to 100 years of the ecosystem and I can't talk about the details now what I can say  is that there's been some radical and clearly anthropogenic changes of the ecosystem of  a civilization that we would have we would say oh no it's small and not many you know<br />
<strong>1:18:12-1:18:29:</strong>  they didn't have chainsaws they didn't have machines but they had radical impact they  weren't much stronger than us you know like they were like our people nowadays like you  know we're like both of us were like men at almost the peak of our like livelihoods like<br />
<strong>1:18:29-1:18:49:</strong>  if you would compare us to people from those times or even people from 150 years ago we're  weak you know like we don't even know how to like you know these guys they were like  really like strong and built and you know like they knew how to cut down a tree even<br />
<strong>1:18:49-1:19:12:</strong>  if they didn't have a chainsaw yeah and anyway so you know like number one these texts they  really inspired me and it made big part of why I wanted to move to the Mediterranean  climate and number one objective behind this project then obviously came to be to re-establish<br />
<strong>1:19:12-1:19:30:</strong>  a functioning Mediterranean forest because coming from the super inspiring example that  Ernst gave to the world where he has like rehabilitated the super destroyed land and  nowadays like it was like based on the index that they have there by a scientific institute<br />
<strong>1:19:30-1:19:50:</strong>  called the IBAMA in Brazil it was the most degraded land in the large region nowadays  it's the most biodiverse most rich in photosynthesis most healthy biome his farm in the whole Atlantic  rainforest region which is a million three hundred thousand square kilometers they've<br />
<strong>1:19:50-1:20:07:</strong>  done studies on the biodiversity there I mean he has many species there that are listed  as extinct I was shocked when I went to his farm it's crazy he has the biggest I saw he  has the biggest collection of genotypes of cacao probably in the whole world he has collected<br />
<strong>1:20:07-1:20:23:</strong>  all kinds of indigenous cacao varieties from all over South America and Middle America  and there's like five hundred genotypes of cacao that he has he's also brought trees  there from the Amazon from Central America from it's like it's a crazy mix of edible<br />
<strong>1:20:23-1:20:40:</strong>  species no for sure like it in Asia everywhere yeah that's fascinating and so you know like  coming from this super inspiring example I just I remember like you know when I realized  that I would have to leave Ernst's farm I started having nightmares about going back<br />
<strong>1:20:40-1:20:54:</strong>  to the city because I really didn't want to leave nature and the natural environment that  I was in and I approached Ernst and I was like Ernst you know I'm getting really worried  I don't know if I want to leave I don't know if I'll ever feel good again living in a city<br />
<strong>1:20:54-1:21:14:</strong>  said Mark that's okay just know that now is the time where you have to leave but if I  was you at your age and if I had seen and learned what you learned and saw here I would  leave with all the certainty inside of me and all the what is it called determination<br />
<strong>1:21:14-1:21:29:</strong>  to do the same thing somewhere else in the world and he like spoke that into my soul  and it like shifted my perspective immediately because before I was like worried about returning  to Europe and all of a sudden I was like super excited I was like let's go I want to start<br />
<strong>1:21:29-1:21:54:</strong>  planting forests in Europe you know so you know I really like it's like so to say like  I feel like we inherited this landscape as it is now and to me it's just like in respect  to all our ancestors I am planting these forests and I want to make a Mediterranean ecosystem<br />
<strong>1:21:54-1:22:14:</strong>  that works again and you know like what was very special experience to me this year I  had the honor I had a client that hired me for a consultancy job in Greece and I got  to plant agroforestry about 500 meters from this huge palace that's made out of boulders<br />
<strong>1:22:14-1:22:31:</strong>  that must weigh like 80 tons or more which apparently was a palace that Hercules built  to live in so that was like the place where Hercules lived which is like one of my favorite  figures from the Greek myths and I planted agroforestry 500 meters from there and like<br />
<strong>1:22:31-1:22:47:</strong>  you just dig in the soil it's like full of ceramics is insane and you know like it's  really like in honor of this heritage and in honor of this beautiful landscape you know  I want to work on these lands and plant these forests and bring these ecosystems to work<br />
<strong>1:22:47-1:23:11:</strong>  again and second objective is to create like an oasis and hotspot and a place of prolonged  well-being for all kinds of pollinating insects and all kind of seed dispersing animals and  also other animals that fulfill other functions in the ecosystem of course including humans<br />
<strong>1:23:11-1:23:32:</strong>  so it's not a natural reserve but it's a place of permanent inclusion of the human which  is another thing that Ernst always talks about and so the third objective is to apply as  much as I can the principles and techniques of syntropic farming here in the Mediterranean<br />
<strong>1:23:32-1:23:57:</strong>  climate and act kind of like as a learning spot and a hotspot for knowledge creation  and knowledge sharing around this topic and yeah we're gonna be sharing some some pictures  of your farm to everybody to conclude there's by now four different fields that I've planted<br />
<strong>1:23:57-1:24:20:</strong>  each one of them is between three thousand to four and a half thousand square meters  big in total they're like 13,000 square meters so 1.3 hectares and on this area I've planted  estimated about 70,000 trees most of them by seed directly a lot of them also now in<br />
<strong>1:24:20-1:24:45:</strong>  more recent years in like this planting season and the one before by nursery seedlings and  yeah it's and then it has all the fruit trees in it as well my farm is mainly focused on  citrus 21 varieties of citrus I have olives I have figs grapes walnuts and let's say grapes<br />
<strong>1:24:45-1:25:08:</strong>  already no peaches that's the sixth one so these six and one of the four fields is also  done completely without irrigation the other three they do receive some irrigation but  it's very limited very nice I think that gives like a very broad explanation of what's here<br />
<strong>1:25:08-1:25:27:</strong>  in the ground I think that this whole story has been of course there's so much to it and  you've been very skilled at telling us this whole adventure that you've been through and  one more thing that I want to clarify is that this project has the objective for me to be<br />
<strong>1:25:27-1:25:40:</strong>  able to continue personally developing as well so it's not just like a learning center  for other people but also learning place for myself I did not just want to go out in the  world and start being a consultant or whatever or working for other people I really wanted<br />
<strong>1:25:40-1:26:00:</strong>  to do things on my own property and get experience in this ecosystem before sharing any knowledge  and that is because I'm not an expert in centropic farming as you had introduced me in the beginning  I'm a student and you know I think that's a big part about the philosophy of centropic<br />
<strong>1:26:00-1:26:18:</strong>  farming is that you never consider yourself a master you never consider yourself an expert  you are an eternal student to mother nature I just want to finish off thanking you so  much for coming on the show it's been you know long overdue and I think it came at exactly<br />
<strong>1:26:18-1:26:34:</strong>  the right moment okay fantastic and we're gonna have another round together and thank  you so much it's been really enjoyable and thank you to all the listeners that listened  with so much interest until the end phenomenal we look forward to hearing you having you<br />
<strong>1:26:34-1:26:54:</strong>  around again that's awesome we'll have all the links and everything on the on the notes  below the episode for you to be able to find out more about Mark and his project and see  you next time thank you so much.  </p>
