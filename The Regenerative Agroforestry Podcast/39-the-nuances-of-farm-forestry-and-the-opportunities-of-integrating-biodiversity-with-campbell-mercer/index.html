  <h1>39 The Nuances Of Farm Forestry And The Opportunities Of Integrating Biodiversity With Campbell Mercer</h1>

<p><strong>0:00:00-0:00:23:</strong>  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  our soils and ecosystems?  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?<br />
<strong>0:00:23-0:00:33:</strong>  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  these challenges.<br />
<strong>0:00:33-0:00:47:</strong>  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  Hello and welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.<br />
<strong>0:00:47-0:00:59:</strong>  I'm your host Dimitri and we've just finished a fantastic interview with Campbell Mercer,  an Australian farmer from Victoria state who has 40 hectares of mixed farm with his main  crop being olive trees.<br />
<strong>0:00:59-0:01:13:</strong>  He's actually a winner of an olive award, you'll hear more about it during the show.  And on his farm he's planted shelter belts, windbreaks, different forestry systems and  has planted his olive trees on a unique plantation pattern called the key line pattern.<br />
<strong>0:01:13-0:01:20:</strong>  So we'll go into all of these subjects.  Again we are talking to a farmer that has 20 years of experience with different tree  systems.<br />
<strong>0:01:20-0:01:29:</strong>  He's already started harvesting his first timber crops.  He's won awards for his olive oil and it was absolutely fascinating so I really hope you  enjoy.<br />
<strong>0:01:29-0:01:36:</strong>  Hello Campbell and welcome on the podcast.  Thank you, thank you, great to be here.  Wow that's awesome.<br />
<strong>0:01:36-0:01:49:</strong>  I wanted to start off by firstly congratulating you on your gold medal in the 2020 Australian  International Olive Awards competition which I found out on your website and I thought  that was quite incredible.<br />
<strong>0:01:49-0:02:10:</strong>  Thank you, yeah no that was really, really pleasing, we're a relatively small farm and  organically certified and yeah a lot of contestants in the international competition and to get  a gold medal was really good and we'll also nominate as the best extra virgin olive oil<br />
<strong>0:02:10-0:02:22:</strong>  in Victoria.  So there's about 73 entries from Victoria as well.  So yeah to be like the best in that group is really pleasing.<br />
<strong>0:02:22-0:02:38:</strong>  Yeah that's really, really amazing to see and I guess that's going to open up lots of  questions about you know how is that happening, how did you make that, you know how did you  get that gold medal and I'm sure we're going to get into it in the conversation little<br />
<strong>0:02:38-0:02:48:</strong>  by little.  But before that maybe we could have a bit of an introduction as to you know what's your  story and how you got started with olive farming.<br />
<strong>0:02:48-0:03:12:</strong>  Right actually yeah I guess I grew up on a farm, a mixed farm and from that yeah went  to university, went into corporate life, did a whole lot of stuff there over a number of  years but I guess once we had children I sat down with my wife and said okay what do we<br />
<strong>0:03:12-0:03:30:</strong>  want to do long term and said okay I said I'd be really keen to get back to the land  and she was really keen as well.  So that's what we decided to do so we moved back to the land, bought this place and at<br />
<strong>0:03:30-0:03:52:</strong>  the time it was a very rundown sheep farm and you know really been you know set stocked,  very poor pasture in fact it mainly had cape weed, we're looking at some early photos from  a few years ago and yeah almost like a hundred percent cape weed and so yeah a huge challenge<br />
<strong>0:03:52-0:04:11:</strong>  to start with but yeah I guess I had a vision and passion and energy and thought yep this  will work for us.  So that's sort of my background, we started about 20 years ago and yeah maybe if I just<br />
<strong>0:04:11-0:04:26:</strong>  tell you a little bit about the farm that'll give a bit of context for you know maybe a  further conversation.  So yeah we're really, we're a small farm, certified organic, we're located at an altitude<br />
<strong>0:04:26-0:04:45:</strong>  of about 500 metres and we're about a hundred kilometres from Melbourne so that's in the  southern part of Australia.  We pretty much have a Mediterranean climate so coolish winters and hot dry summers so<br />
<strong>0:04:45-0:05:01:</strong>  classified as temperate in terms of climate.  So in winter we do get down to zero at night and maybe six or eight degrees during the  day and occasionally get snow but most of the rain occurs in the winter and then in<br />
<strong>0:05:01-0:05:26:</strong>  summers they tend to be relatively dry and hot so typically high 30s we usually get a  bout of days in the 40s but that depends on the season because we're typically impacted  by both La Nina and El Nino so we're the reverse of South America.<br />
<strong>0:05:26-0:05:40:</strong>  So when there's an El Nino they get flooding, we get droughts, this year we're a La Nina  so we're getting flooding so Brisbane up north of Australia they've had a metre of rain in  the last three days.<br />
<strong>0:05:40-0:05:59:</strong>  Yeah I saw that on the news huh, it looked pretty bad.  So lots of rain in a La Nina season, having said that because we're down south we're not  as affected and it hasn't rained here for a month like zero and so yeah so we get quite<br />
<strong>0:05:59-0:06:20:</strong>  a lot of variability and historically the rainfall here has been around 700 milli year  but it's fallen with climate change and we're probably closer to an average of around 600  with quite significant variations in the last few years we've had as low of 400 and as much<br />
<strong>0:06:20-0:06:37:</strong>  as 850 so yeah big variation year to year.  Just to give a bit of background on the soil because that has a huge impact in terms of  what you can grow and how you can grow it, it's really old soil like a lot of Australia<br />
<strong>0:06:37-0:06:55:</strong>  we're on very old soil it's about 400 million years old and that doesn't mean much to many  people but to put it in perspective when this soil was laid down there was only one continent  that was Gondwanaland so it was one super continent that's when the soil was laid down<br />
<strong>0:06:55-0:07:14:</strong>  for this place so it is really really old.  So as a result like a lot of Australian soils it's relatively infertile and has relatively  higher concentration of heavy metals things like iron, aluminium and they tend to lock<br />
<strong>0:07:14-0:07:30:</strong>  up your nutrients in the soil so you know in terms of what you do and your biological  treatment and how do you unlock some of that then yeah that's really really important in  this context.<br />
<strong>0:07:30-0:07:54:</strong>  And our topsoil was really really thin like yeah the previous owner really just had flogged  it out so the topsoil was maybe 25 mil thick and then you went pretty quickly into like  a hard clay layer with quite a lot of stone through it and luckily the stone gives it<br />
<strong>0:07:54-0:08:11:</strong>  pretty good infiltration so that's the one upside but relatively infertile and we're  generally north facing slopes and so because we're in the southern hemisphere that means  we're warmer and drier typically.<br />
<strong>0:08:11-0:08:33:</strong>  So yeah that's a bit of context in terms of you know about the farm itself the sort of  temperature we have, sort of soil we have and yeah and you know potentially just a little  bit about the farm itself sorry I just should probably put that in is that you know we've<br />
<strong>0:08:33-0:08:58:</strong>  developed quite a diverse set of activities across the farm so we've got agroforestry  which is to my sense classic agroforestry close spacing 4x3 meter spacing typically  Australian natives but for the most part with one or two exceptions not indigenous and I'll<br />
<strong>0:08:58-0:09:15:</strong>  come back to that in a moment.  We also have wide spaced tree crops which is you know probably what people think is  the traditional silvopasture so that's on a 15x15 meter spacing so yeah plenty of grazing<br />
<strong>0:09:15-0:09:30:</strong>  opportunity and alley cropping.  Then we have olives so we have about two and a half thousand trees olives which run an  8x5 meter spacing non-irrigated so we're dry range.<br />
<strong>0:09:30-0:09:54:</strong>  We also have a riparian zone which is about 20% of the total land area and we're really  committed to regenerating that to the original vegetation which is grassy woodland and the  reason for that is that in the state of Victoria is that we've got about less than 1% of that<br />
<strong>0:09:54-0:10:11:</strong>  natural grassland left from pre-european settlement so and again we can talk about some of the  things we're doing there.  We also have some open grazing land that's large the exotic imported grass species and<br />
<strong>0:10:11-0:10:27:</strong>  extensive sheller belts so that sort of gives a bit of a summary about the place.  Yeah it gives us a bit too much to talk about as well this is the problem as we had talked  about as we had said before Campbell it's too much stuff to discuss too many interesting<br />
<strong>0:10:27-0:10:43:</strong>  projects going on which makes the interview more challenging.  You know there's one or two details I wanted to confirm with you I was curious about this  actual size of the farm you said it was relatively small but how many hectares do you have?<br />
<strong>0:10:43-0:10:53:</strong>  So it's just a little under 40 hectares.  And when did you start farming over there when did you actually like buy the land and  or take over the land?<br />
<strong>0:10:53-0:11:10:</strong>  Yeah so we started out in 2002 so it's almost exactly 20 years ago.  You know I saw on your website and as you explained earlier on you're organic and I  was curious why you had decided to go organic what was the motivation for that?<br />
<strong>0:11:10-0:11:41:</strong>  Yeah so I guess it was all driven by a personal belief that 20 years ago that was quite unusual  less unusual now but I guess I was personally committed to agriculture without the use of  you know industrial fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and so it was really taken from<br />
<strong>0:11:41-0:12:02:</strong>  a philosophical approach and subsequently I discovered that yeah there's certainly a  premium associated with organic produce and you know one of the advantages certainly in  terms of selling my olives and olive oil and olive products is that organic certification<br />
<strong>0:12:02-0:12:15:</strong>  is that that gives me some opportunities that enables me to compete in the marketplace and  still make a living.  I guess that's also yeah it's similar to our case in Massey farm I guess we came from a<br />
<strong>0:12:15-0:12:28:</strong>  philosophical place at the beginning wanting to not put chemicals on our land as challenging  as that can be at times.  Yeah it's not as if we don't have weeds and it's not as if we don't have pests and all<br />
<strong>0:12:28-0:12:49:</strong>  the rest of it it's just saying okay well you know there's I actually think industrial  farming as a general rule shows of lack of imagination is that you know for every problem  that you have if you see it as a problem is that there's an opportunity there and to a<br />
<strong>0:12:49-0:13:07:</strong>  large extent you're just challenged to find what that opportunity is and so yeah I think  it's just a smarter way you've just got to be smarter in terms of the way in which you  approach things and be happy with complexity but that's the other issue is that you've<br />
<strong>0:13:07-0:13:21:</strong>  got to recognize that these are complex systems and that you know if you apply a simple solution  you end up with a whole lot of unintended consequences because we don't understand the  systems.<br />
<strong>0:13:21-0:13:48:</strong>  Is that why you have planted such a or integrated such a diverse set of systems on your farm?  Yeah part of this was driven like our agroforestry is a diverse species agroforestry so we have  you know quite probably about a dozen different species that we've planted across there.<br />
<strong>0:13:48-0:14:14:</strong>  Some of that was just in terms of how did we want to go about putting the agroforestry  in so we planted an indigenous species about every second tree which was a black wattle  which is acacia myrnsii and it grows very very quickly and as a result it forces the<br />
<strong>0:14:14-0:14:35:</strong>  other trees to grow straight up to get to the light and so it saves a lot of pruning  by doing that so you get these trees and because they're indigenous species they have a lot  of indigenous pests and typically they don't last live much longer than about somewhere<br />
<strong>0:14:35-0:14:58:</strong>  between 15 and 25 years and so on one of our dryer plots you know they basically all died  they got the lyctospora into them and they've all died which is great it's then left the  other species to continue to grow and we're getting some great logs coming from those.<br />
<strong>0:14:58-0:15:20:</strong>  In the wetter portion where they were quite happy to keep growing to some extent is that  I had to thin them out to enable enough water for the timber species but what I'd done  which most people don't do with nursemaid crops is I'd actually prune them and so when<br />
<strong>0:15:20-0:15:46:</strong>  we actually cut them out it actually because they're very fast growing it actually gave  me quite a number of saw logs and so we ended up with about 500 or 600 saw logs out of that  which we then milled and I've subsequently been able to sell and I've sold a lot recently<br />
<strong>0:15:46-0:16:12:</strong>  to there's a local group who have built a hut it's called the 21st century hut there's  a video on YouTube and I supplied all the timber for that for the flooring and for the  doors and I personally think it looks magnificent and even historically the black wattle tends<br />
<strong>0:16:12-0:16:35:</strong>  to have been overlooked as a species it was used a lot for tanning because it has a high  tonic tannin content in the bark and so traditionally used for tanning but it was never really used  as a timber tree and it's a beautiful tree it initially when you cut it it looks you<br />
<strong>0:16:35-0:16:56:</strong>  know it's like a milky white but then over the following three days as it oxidizes it  turns into a red and it has this wonderful reddish sheen to it it is magnificent and  it's quite quite a hard timber dense timber but yeah yeah that's definitely a two birds<br />
<strong>0:16:56-0:17:11:</strong>  with with one stone situation there because you're you're facilitating or making your  management easier whilst at the same time getting a harvest out of it is it the first  harvest from your forestry plots yeah correct correct so that was our first thinning probably<br />
<strong>0:17:11-0:17:33:</strong>  a little later than it should have been but part of the reason for that is that ironically  2002 was the start of the millennium drought and so we had record low rainfall for eight  successive years and as a result of that everything grew really slowly I'd have to say even my<br />
<strong>0:17:33-0:17:59:</strong>  olives the olives survived but they didn't really grow and they certainly didn't produce  and similarly with the forestry is that it didn't grow very quickly and so so yeah I  guess I when did we thin it we thinned it about five years ago I guess and is when we<br />
<strong>0:17:59-0:18:24:</strong>  took the all the all the black bottle out and yeah and and you know we sort of like  used a swing over saw and you know cut that into pieces which we could then use and quite  a lot of it we cut up because each each log you look at and say what's the best or most<br />
<strong>0:18:24-0:18:42:</strong>  timber I can get out of this and and so each log you know you get different dimension species  a different dimensioned blocks of timber but you need to be fairly consistent in terms  of otherwise you end up with a complete mismatch and it's unsaleable so you've got to think<br />
<strong>0:18:42-0:19:00:</strong>  okay what's the end use going to be and we anticipated that it could be a floral so we  actually cut a lot at flooring width okay and so this is you sold it to a local group  it was kind it's kind of like you didn't sell it to a cooperative that then sold it to that<br />
<strong>0:19:00-0:19:19:</strong>  group you you went to see that that company or that group I can't remember exactly what  it was directly correct you went to see them and okay yep so it was just locally sold in  a very short circuit circuit very very yeah and part of that you know around the whole<br />
<strong>0:19:19-0:19:41:</strong>  idea of the hut that they built was all about sourcing products as close as possible to  you know using local indigenous species and sourcing them as close as possible to the  hut itself and the huts about five kilometers from my place wow that's that's ideal that's<br />
<strong>0:19:41-0:20:03:</strong>  a quite a good sales opportunity yeah because I would expect small quantities like this  could be sometimes hard to sell am I am I mistaken no that's probably right there's  slowly becoming more opportunities but in many cases it is small private sales where<br />
<strong>0:20:03-0:20:24:</strong>  people see the end product and say yeah I'd really love a room of that or you know I'd  love a bench made out of that or a table or something like that and by knowing some of  the local artisans who are involved in that process then you know they can give me a call<br />
<strong>0:20:24-0:20:46:</strong>  and say look you know we've got this opportunity you interested in selling some of your timber  so so yeah it's a matter of you know local networks and rather than trying to sell it  into a much broader market where it becomes very difficult yeah because they I mean the<br />
<strong>0:20:46-0:21:02:</strong>  forestry companies and they're reaching economies of scale that yeah I can only imagine I don't  know what the case is like in Australia but the price of timber is just really low as  compared to to your costs on a smaller scale yeah absolutely you can never make that work<br />
<strong>0:21:02-0:21:25:</strong>  never so and and there's a whole lot of forests put in here which were actually put in they  grew blue gums and the whole purpose of growing them was for wood chips you know from to make  paper and you know it's it's sort of bizarre because it's wood chips is about the lowest<br />
<strong>0:21:25-0:21:49:</strong>  value product you can get out of timber and blue gums which is eucalyptus globulus is  a tremendous timber tree like yeah it's it can be used for a whole lot of structural  purposes it's very clear it's a clean growing timber and they just planted them really densely<br />
<strong>0:21:49-0:22:07:</strong>  and just chop them down for wood chips just like travesty in some respects that's interesting  it's the same case here in Portugal they've planted lots of eucalyptus globulus I'm actually  in Portugal right now that's why I'm saying here and they yeah it's just you know they<br />
<strong>0:22:07-0:22:23:</strong>  I can't remember exactly what the cycle is it may be after 10 years but you know they  harvest them they copies them and they do that after a few rounds and actually I went  to visit a farm a small farm just north of Lisbon once and they they took over land that<br />
<strong>0:22:23-0:22:39:</strong>  had been through a few of these cycles and they had a pH of four and they had so that  the soil was completely depleted of all of its cations and it was just it was very very  challenging condition yeah absolutely so you know it's interesting as well to see how that<br />
<strong>0:22:39-0:23:04:</strong>  affected the the soil capital there yep as a side note but I wanted to zoom out just  a tiny bit and looking at remaining inside the the topic of the farm forestry is or agroforestry  as you as you call it and I'm curious as to what were your main objectives with it why<br />
<strong>0:23:04-0:23:25:</strong>  did you you know you have 40 hectares of land and it's relatively small size of land why  did you decide to diversify with the forestry what were your main objectives there so part  of it was around to create some biodiversity is that yeah so a lot of the farms around<br />
<strong>0:23:25-0:23:46:</strong>  here a lot of them were were cleared they may have left one or two trees for stock bit  of shelter for the stock you know a bit of shade on a hot day maybe but you know only  a small amount number of the flock or herd could actually ever get underneath the tree<br />
<strong>0:23:46-0:24:03:</strong>  and then of course you get a whole lot of compaction because the stock always camp underneath  tree and eventually the tree dies and you can see lots of paddocks around here where  you know these magnificent old trees and they're all dead so you just get these skeletons just<br />
<strong>0:24:03-0:24:31:</strong>  standing out in the paddock so I was looking to you know regenerate the land and I saw  agroforestry as a great way to do that and I didn't really see myself as giving up a  huge amount in that okay for the first few years you don't get a whole lot of grass in<br />
<strong>0:24:31-0:24:49:</strong>  the understory but once you've done that first thinning you're getting a reasonable amount  of grass and a great deal of protection for stock so I can still run my sheep underneath  you know the agroforestry plots after the first thinning actually even ran them before<br />
<strong>0:24:49-0:25:08:</strong>  the first thinning but you know there's a reasonable amount of grass there after the  first thinning and you know a lot of shelter so you know whenever the weather turns bad  the sheep always move into the agroforestry blocks and so you know there's a whole lot<br />
<strong>0:25:08-0:25:28:</strong>  of benefits associated with having trees on farms and I think we really miss out on some  of those opportunities even for people who are just running livestock but there's all  these other opportunities that you have and in terms of yep you can get some value from<br />
<strong>0:25:28-0:25:47:</strong>  the timber that you're growing you also get a whole lot of biodiversity so you know we  have something like 76 bird species here which we see on a pretty regular basis which is  up quite a lot on what we used to have which is down in the 50s and so you know we're getting<br />
<strong>0:25:47-0:26:09:</strong>  a lot of wildlife coming back as a result of you know this biodiverse plantation and  then I'm still getting a whole lot of value from it so not only do I get the value from  the timber but you know the larger logs that are no good for timber I can turn into firewood<br />
<strong>0:26:09-0:26:31:</strong>  which is pretty low value I understand that and then the next size down I turn that I've  got a furnace and I turn that into biochar and then the smallest pieces I then run through  a chipper and you know through an 8 inch chipper and it'll turn those into small wood chips<br />
<strong>0:26:31-0:26:53:</strong>  and I either use that as mulch or more recently I've been using it to convert that into compost  using the Johnson Sue method I'm not sure if you're aware of it but that is a great  way it takes a bit of time but that is a great way to produce an outstanding compost and<br />
<strong>0:26:53-0:27:20:</strong>  then I use that as a compost extract to you know enhance the biological life on my soils  so you know I see a lot of products coming out of that to enable me and you know so like  not on a commercial basis I also have bees and you know if you have a diverse agroforestry<br />
<strong>0:27:20-0:27:37:</strong>  plot then you end up with trees flowering at different times of the year and so you  know you then get honey as another product that comes out of this biodiverse you know  essentially agroforestry plantation.<br />
<strong>0:27:37-0:27:56:</strong>  That's very interesting and I'm curious have you have you planted these agroforestry plots  in specific parts of the landscape based on kind of their ecological sensitivity or have  you sensibility sorry or have you been placing them how did the design unfold?<br />
<strong>0:27:56-0:28:18:</strong>  Yeah so the design unfolded depending on pretty much on the slope and how much sun each block  would get and so essentially the way we laid it out is we put the olives on the gentle  facing northern slopes and that then left us other areas okay what are we going to do<br />
<strong>0:28:18-0:28:43:</strong>  with these so we had a very quite a steep slope of face east it's quite dry and you  know to some extent too steep to get a harvester an olive harvester onto so we grew  you know some quite dry species in that area so none of them are indigenous they're all<br />
<strong>0:28:43-0:29:02:</strong>  native to Australia but they're not indigenous to this area and then we had some south facing  slopes which because we're in the southern hemisphere are wetter and so we grew a different  set of species really focused on that so you know to answer your question yeah absolutely<br />
<strong>0:29:02-0:29:19:</strong>  we looked at the slope and what sort of microclimate we were going to get in each of those areas  and then determined which trees that we're going to put into which area.  Nice okay so it was also making use of the more marginal areas of the land.<br />
<strong>0:29:19-0:29:30:</strong>  Correct.  The ones that were more challenging to cultivate olives on.  Yep yeah so you know again really trying to maximize the value out of the landscape that<br />
<strong>0:29:30-0:29:43:</strong>  you have but again it also generates a whole lot of generates more biodiversity that's  the other thing is that you end up with different species in different areas and that really  works as well.<br />
<strong>0:29:43-0:30:00:</strong>  It complements the ecological matrix of your land of your 40 hectares by creating a diverse  set of ecosystems which creates a diverse set of products a diverse set of organisms  that can live in it it's from my perspective and also from interviewing many<br />
<strong>0:30:00-0:30:16:</strong>  people that do agroforestry we can see that these situations they often create a lot more  complexity to manage but at the same time they create also a lot more opportunity.  Some people have even been using these types of plantations to create tourism opportunities<br />
<strong>0:30:16-0:30:33:</strong>  yet bird watching crews onto their land to you know there's so many different ways in  which we can we can kind of make that biodiversity have an economic sense for us in order to  do to maintain it and to care for it and to actually be motivated to plant it.<br />
<strong>0:30:33-0:30:53:</strong>  I don't know I'm curious to know what your take on that.  Yeah no I'm with you 100% but to me it's not just an economic outcome it's also a great  environment to live in to have you know that biodiverse areas in a sense the whole landscape<br />
<strong>0:30:53-0:31:12:</strong>  becomes biodiverse then that you end up with a lot of different species and it's just a  really nice place to really go and wander around and spend time in and you know how  do you put value on that is that you know I think we lose sight of the human spirit<br />
<strong>0:31:12-0:31:32:</strong>  like you know on our south facing slopes of trees is like really grown really tall and  sometimes when the sun is coming up I'm over there working it feels like you're in a cathedral  like you just have these massive trees that go straight up you know the sun coming in<br />
<strong>0:31:32-0:31:52:</strong>  it just you know you get that golden light it really is it's really uplifting to the  soul and yeah absolutely I'm not saying that there's not economic benefits associated with  that but I think we sometimes by bringing everything down to the dollar we sometimes<br />
<strong>0:31:52-0:32:08:</strong>  miss on some of the really really important things.  Yeah I find that very inspiring and you know on the podcast we're often thinking about  the economics and because it's something that it drives so many of our decisions nowadays<br />
<strong>0:32:08-0:32:25:</strong>  probably not just nowadays probably back in the days as well but you know we're often  trying to find the economic answers for farmers through the in the podcast by interviewing  people and we have to admit we can sometimes be ignoring or be not putting enough value<br />
<strong>0:32:25-0:32:43:</strong>  on the much more you know emotional or quality of life things that agroforestry and trees  and complex landscapes can provide to us so I'm very happy that here you're being an advocate  for that because it's necessary reminding me as well.<br />
<strong>0:32:43-0:33:08:</strong>  You know it's I think it's really important for us to live in landscapes that you know  we really enjoy and really feel connected to you know almost in a spiritual way and  you know we we like discount that at our peril you know does everyone want you know and to<br />
<strong>0:33:08-0:33:24:</strong>  some extent you've seen that in quite a few countries and in this one as well where you  know to get the GPS equipment to work and everything else they've taken out every single  thing you know corner to corner so that you know the GPS controlled tractor can just go<br />
<strong>0:33:24-0:33:47:</strong>  round and round and round and you know it's you know it's industrial agriculture it's  lost its soul it's and you know where does that place us in the future so I don't discount  that because again can you monetize that absolutely you can monetize that is that yeah you can<br />
<strong>0:33:47-0:34:06:</strong>  get people people come here and they're really they love the environment and so yeah could  I make money by running tours and all the rest of it absolutely and you know people  have run up and wanted to run weddings here and those sorts of things so yes you can monetize<br />
<strong>0:34:06-0:34:26:</strong>  it because people feel good in this environment but I think it's important to say you do it  because it's the right thing to do and okay if you need to monetize it afterwards then  so be it you just become innovative about how you're going to monetize that but to just<br />
<strong>0:34:26-0:34:47:</strong>  do things on the basis that well this is going to make me an extra dollar it's pretty soulless  yeah yeah yeah fully fully agree that's very interesting so what's the next tree that you're  going to harvest so yeah the next tree that's an interesting question I'll probably take<br />
<strong>0:34:47-0:35:15:</strong>  out I had put some light woods in which is a that's also an acacia it's a acacia inplexa  and they're all hickory wattle they grow quite well but I haven't been I was overly pleased  with them so I'll probably take some of those out and they'll make a very nice furniture<br />
<strong>0:35:15-0:35:45:</strong>  grade timber and I'll probably take out some sugar gums sugar gums eucalyptus cladecalyx  and very hard timber very dense timber actually originally came from a very small part of  Australia over in South Australia and they're but grow in much drier areas historically<br />
<strong>0:35:45-0:36:12:</strong>  than here and so they have grown amazingly well and so I think probably in the next five  years or so some of those will definitely be you know commercial grade in terms of be  able to take them out and use them for various uses the the only downside of sugar gums is<br />
<strong>0:36:12-0:36:30:</strong>  that it is a very heavy timber so for furniture you know if you're making furniture out of  it you end up with whatever you're making is really heavy like if you make if you make  a table out of it you know you need like three people to lift it so that's probably the only<br />
<strong>0:36:30-0:36:51:</strong>  downside otherwise you know I yeah to me I quite like a heavy table so but yeah sometimes  we will say oh you know that's a bit of a downside but you know it's a it's a class  one grade timber so you can you know use it use it in the ground if you want to use it<br />
<strong>0:36:51-0:37:14:</strong>  in the ground won't you've got a 50-year life in the ground so you know it has a huge number  of uses but you know I guess I'll be focusing on what are the high value uses I can get  out of it and yeah I think there's there's some some furniture possibilities definitely<br />
<strong>0:37:14-0:37:36:</strong>  so this would be to collaborate with local artisans again this would be you producing  the furniture yourself no no I'll and again depends on how we set it up depends on whether  I take it down and mill it certainly you know I think if you want a reasonable value for<br />
<strong>0:37:36-0:38:00:</strong>  your timber you've got to mill it if just selling selling logs selling logs on a small  scale yeah you'll never get that to work from a financial perspective so so you do have  to mill it and you know it's I have access to a swing blade saw so that's typically what<br />
<strong>0:38:00-0:38:24:</strong>  I use but for furniture grade timber possibly a bandsaw would be better but you know let's  not have that debate now because there's huge forums where people argue about one sort of  saw being better than another yeah and it's it's a bit beyond my mind I'm not super familiar<br />
<strong>0:38:24-0:38:38:</strong>  with the different ways of harvesting wood and actually even the forestry aspects this  is not so specialized in it I'm sure there's a lot of podcasts that are very specialized  in this though and there's some there could be some can maybe give a few recommendations<br />
<strong>0:38:38-0:38:51:</strong>  afterwards but you know for me I'm seeing it more from a strategic point of view when  you're telling me you know I need to get these saws you know and it's that means that you  need to have the infrastructure locally either on your farm which means you need to buy it<br />
<strong>0:38:51-0:39:05:</strong>  which may be a very high cost based on your small scale or you need to have it regionally  available so you can rent it or use it or you know take it off a mate or something in  order to so what's how are you managing that yourself do you have it on farm no I don't<br />
<strong>0:39:05-0:39:28:</strong>  have it on farm I borrow it from a mate who does a lot more of it than I do the yeah and  I think so yeah you don't have to own everything you know from my perspective I think from  from a farming perspective the things that you really need to own are those things that<br />
<strong>0:39:28-0:39:46:</strong>  are time urgent like you know really weather dependent and you know when it needs to be  done it needs to be done now sort of thing and you know in that situation contractors  are problematic because they're off doing a job somewhere else and you know you join<br />
<strong>0:39:46-0:40:05:</strong>  the queue and whatever so you end up with a suboptimal result and even typically in  an area you can't really borrow from someone else because if it's optimal time for you  it's optimal time for them as well so there's a small amount of equipment that I think you<br />
<strong>0:40:05-0:40:26:</strong>  have to have you have to own but other than that I think yeah particularly as the properties  as you probably get smaller it becomes difficult to justify that sort of expenditure yeah it  makes sense and so what about the the drying as well because I have I have read Rowan Reid's<br />
<strong>0:40:26-0:40:46:</strong>  book on on how to manage a high quality timber and it was very instructive for me as a very  having very basic knowledge on on on the subject and I and it was fascinating to see how he  the technicalities of drying wood right how everything seems to be able to go wrong yes<br />
<strong>0:40:46-0:41:05:</strong>  with drying wood so I'm curious do you also have a kiln do you how do you dry the wood  and maintain like you know the quality that you're that you're you're trying to get yeah  so I aired right so I don't kiln dry it so you probably end up with a bit more wastage<br />
<strong>0:41:05-0:41:35:</strong>  I was really surprised with the black wattle how little wastage we had is that so you know  we we ended up with very small amounts of end checking so that's cracking from the ends  and and dimensionally it was great in terms of you know when it dried it basically dried<br />
<strong>0:41:35-0:41:58:</strong>  in all the dimensions obviously you know it dries out faster radially than it does through  the ends but it dimensionally stayed very very stable and I'll be interested to see  what happens with some of my other trees I did mill up a brown stringy bark at the time<br />
<strong>0:41:58-0:42:25:</strong>  and it yeah it didn't perform particularly well and so if if it looks like and I'll do  the same thing again I'll just do a trial and if that works and I can get away with  air drying then I'll air dry if I can't air dry then there is a kiln which is about I<br />
<strong>0:42:25-0:42:45:</strong>  don't know 20 kilometers from me which is available commercially so you can actually  book time in it and I would do that yeah but you know if I can air dry I'll air dry yeah  so that it makes it means that it's quite it's quite easy for you to in terms of infrastructure<br />
<strong>0:42:45-0:43:01:</strong>  with the with the with the mill close by that you can you can rent off it's quite a it's  quite an easy condition for you to be able to process on farm and to be able to sell  directly to your local community around I guess the other advantage is that I'm very<br />
<strong>0:43:01-0:43:20:</strong>  close to a large population center and so you know one of one of the issues typically  associated with timber or any agricultural produce really is that you know if you're  a long way from the market then you know that then then you lose value essentially because<br />
<strong>0:43:20-0:43:40:</strong>  you've got to transport it and organize it and all the rest of it so being close to a  large population center is is pretty helpful do you also prune the the the trees do you  have to quite intimately manage them to be able to get some nice logs so yes yeah they<br />
<strong>0:43:40-0:44:08:</strong>  do require pruning and I high pruned three years ago to about six meters and I think  I'll go a bit higher I think I might even take it out to nine meters and and the the  the magic number about six of course is that our standard lumber dimension is six meters<br />
<strong>0:44:08-0:44:29:</strong>  fits into a 20-foot container it's probably pretty standard across the globe but I went  and visited someone who is very high pruning they were going they were hoping to get to  12 meters which would give them to six meter length but they they had quite a few trees<br />
<strong>0:44:29-0:44:50:</strong>  which were at nine meters which they were taking out and they said look a three meter  log is actually very very saleable and so because yeah there's a lot of things that  don't need something longer than three meters so you know what why why grow if you can grow<br />
<strong>0:44:50-0:45:12:</strong>  that extra three meters basically for a little bit of pruning effort then why wouldn't you  I recently had a conversation with last week actually with an Italian farmer who has also  30 hectares and he's planted five hectares of a specific forestry design which is called<br />
<strong>0:45:12-0:45:28:</strong>  polycyclic forestry and there's an organization in Italy that's developing this doing a lot  of research on it and it's basically mixing multiple species together and harvesting them  at specific times it's a diverse diverse forestry project with trees having multiple functions<br />
<strong>0:45:28-0:45:45:</strong>  right in terms of shaping the the more long-term species and you know self-prune helping them  to to have straight stems to prune to self-prune etc and what he was saying is you know he  was very happy with the profitability of it even though he was selling poplars to a company<br />
<strong>0:45:45-0:46:01:</strong>  that was just coming in and they were just harvesting a poplar it was one euro per centimeter  of diameter per poplar and the poplars were after 11 12 euros 11 12 years they were already  coming in to harvest them and he wants he wanted to grow his forestry and he wanted<br />
<strong>0:46:01-0:46:16:</strong>  to take over more of his land instead of having cereals having more and more forestry little  by little so I'm I'm curious of course different contexts different etc but I'm curious about  he was very happy about the profitability right and I'm curious in contrast to the conversation<br />
<strong>0:46:16-0:46:29:</strong>  we had a bit earlier on what what how do you how do you feel about the profitability of  your forestry is it something that you would say no this is a profitable enterprise or  is it something that you are doing for ecosystem services and for beauty and for for even just<br />
<strong>0:46:29-0:46:47:</strong>  different spiritual reasons that you that you brought up with a compliment an economic  compliment to try and cover some of the costs yeah but it's I think it's a bit of both you  know to some extent I was really pleased to get value out of the first pruning so the<br />
<strong>0:46:47-0:47:14:</strong>  first thing because for most people that's you know almost just the cost whereas I was  able to you know I've pretty much broke even so far and I still have six cubic meters of  timber to sell so you know for for you essentially for your first thinning to actually be able<br />
<strong>0:47:14-0:47:40:</strong>  to make money out of that I think that's that's a pretty good outcome now could I have I made  more out of the alternative use of that land probably but you know if I think about okay  for example running livestock I could have done more intensively but I think I got a<br />
<strong>0:47:40-0:48:02:</strong>  reasonable amount of livestock fodder out of those areas in any case and so I'd have  to weigh up the pros and cons and then there's the protection that they provide and therefore  your animals grow faster you know it's multifaceted and so you know I think I'm pleased with where<br />
<strong>0:48:02-0:48:26:</strong>  it is at the moment I think I think there'll be more value in the future as I get some  of these other timber species start coming online I've got some iron bark which is Eucalyptus  Tricarpa and I reckon they'll be ready for harvesting in about 10 years and another magnificent<br />
<strong>0:48:26-0:48:52:</strong>  timber very very hard you know you've got to drill it to be able to to nail it it's  it's but you know magnificent for you know outdoor decking outdoor furniture that sort  of thing because again it's a beautiful deep red colour so yeah it's you know it's it's<br />
<strong>0:48:52-0:49:13:</strong>  just like a natural for for outdoor furniture or you know an outdoor barbeque setting or  whatever and so I think again there will be a lot of value associated with that not just  selling the the tree as stumpage but okay let's you know talk with some of the people<br />
<strong>0:49:13-0:49:30:</strong>  who are going to produce the end products find out from them what sort of sized pieces  they're looking for and essentially you know milled to order and I think there'll be some  great value coming out of that. Interesting I like how you've also said that you know<br />
<strong>0:49:30-0:49:47:</strong>  it's multifaceted and it integrates the other activities of the farm right it integrates  the other also objectives your personal objectives the objectives of the farm it's it's a compliment  without being necessarily the an end in itself it's it's it's something that's it's part<br />
<strong>0:49:47-0:50:05:</strong>  of your ecosystem that you've created. And I think that's a good way to put it it is  part of the the ecosystem that we've created here and to some extent you know you can't  just pull out one piece and say well this is the value of that because you know it does<br />
<strong>0:50:05-0:50:22:</strong>  provide multiple benefits and and so it is it is more difficult to say oh well you know  this is the benefit from that because we got this piece of timber from it yeah but what  about all the other benefits that you got from that because you know it provides habitat<br />
<strong>0:50:22-0:50:40:</strong>  for eagles which then you know takes on the rabbits which means they don't create as big  a problem for your olive trees because they'll ring bark them and so you know how do you  put a value on that? I'm currently doing a masters in natural resource management and<br />
<strong>0:50:40-0:50:54:</strong>  but then it's basically an agroforestry masters at the University of Missouri and this is  what we're seeing right now is just you know how do you even just creating a scientific  study on agroforestry systems it costs 10 times more than a study comparing for this<br />
<strong>0:50:54-0:51:12:</strong>  type of fertilizer vs this type of fertilizer on a crop right or for example you know it's  it's it's a completely other type of of agricultural it's just very complex so they they have a  lot of problems to try and they they encounter a lot of of issues with you know trying to<br />
<strong>0:51:12-0:51:30:</strong>  create data on it it's quite it's quite challenging and it's just a parallel to what we're describing  here as well it's how do you put a value on on all of these these different services that  the trees provide but I'm zooming in a bit more now to the technical stuff you said you<br />
<strong>0:51:30-0:51:46:</strong>  had two types of plantations you had some of them that were on that were very close  together what did you say it was four by three yep and one of them which was eight by five  eight by five was olives and then I have what I call my tree crop area which is 15 by 15<br />
<strong>0:51:46-0:52:10:</strong>  so quite wide spacing and that's for timber production long term it'll be timber but I've  planted species there that it won't be my lifetime again I've planted them because they  produce multiple benefits even now so the sort of trees that are in there are oaks,<br />
<strong>0:52:10-0:52:34:</strong>  chestnuts, hazels just in defense amongst them and and some other exotics so pretty much  they're exotic species the advantage of that of course is that you know a lot of that is  really good pig food and so one of the opportunities I see is to run you know free-range organic<br />
<strong>0:52:34-0:52:58:</strong>  pigs and you know while the trees are growing and you know oaks are not known to to grow  quickly so yeah as I said we won't be milling them in my lifetime but I am managing them  on the basis that they'll be able to be harvested as timber at some point in the future so but<br />
<strong>0:52:58-0:53:15:</strong>  I get all these other products in the meantime yeah sorry you're not managing them for especially  nut production you're managing them more for timber production with the complement of chestnuts  or acorns hazels etc indeed although I have to say it depends a little bit on the tree<br />
<strong>0:53:15-0:53:36:</strong>  because the chestnut the chestnuts is a general rule yeah I really haven't lent themselves  to timber I have to say and so the oaks have the oaks of you know if you prune oaks that  yep they'll keep going up and I've got some sequoias and Himalayan cedars and things in<br />
<strong>0:53:36-0:54:00:</strong>  there as well but and they're definitely all being pruned for forestry timber production  at some point but you know again even those species produce great shade and habitat while  they're growing and the other advantages by high pruning is that it's really easy to get<br />
<strong>0:54:00-0:54:19:</strong>  equipment underneath so you know it's easy to run tractors and harvesters and that sort  of stuff because the branches are you know after a few years are well up so yeah it has  has multiple benefits associated with that and I have to say at that sort of spacing<br />
<strong>0:54:19-0:54:42:</strong>  you can't tell any downgrade in the amount of grass production that you get is that I  would say it's as much possibly more because you know you get all the mycorrhizal fungi  and other things happening symbiotic relationships and yeah so as a result it's almost like you<br />
<strong>0:54:42-0:55:03:</strong>  know it hasn't cost you anything in terms of production and yet you get all these other  benefits and it gives me the opportunity to you know potentially run pigs in the future  or whatever and then I can raise acorn or chestnut raised pigs so you know I think that<br />
<strong>0:55:03-0:55:26:</strong>  there's multiple opportunities there and you know chestnuts of course you can sell outright.  Wow that's fantastic you really make me want to visit your farm because I'm inviting myself  here if you'll notice because it's I regularly do that with guests.<br />
<strong>0:55:26-0:55:39:</strong>  I get too excited and I just tell people I want to come and visit them.  Yeah no absolutely I'd be happy to.  Because it looks so diverse it seems like there's so much to learn from that you know<br />
<strong>0:55:39-0:55:51:</strong>  especially this grass I mean when we're looking at the silver pastoral you know tending towards  more silver pastoral system as opposed to a more forestry system as we've discussed  before the interaction between the trees and the grass is absolutely fascinating.<br />
<strong>0:55:51-0:56:12:</strong>  I'm working in the context now where there's a so in Portugal in the montado which is these  very old large home and cork oak trees and they the grass underneath the oaks is much  like twice the size of the grass in the open and you know trying to understand the reasons<br />
<strong>0:56:12-0:56:30:</strong>  for that is interesting and there can be multiple and we're talking a lot about this with Francisco  who's also a guest from the podcast from before I think episode 26 and yeah it's you know  there is a real interaction with these native grasses there and the oak trees and grass<br />
<strong>0:56:30-0:56:49:</strong>  grows better after grazing the grass responds faster even when he's putting when there's  a lot of blackberries underneath the oaks and he puts the goats there is like twice  the recovery is twice as fast underneath the oak trees even though we could say competition<br />
<strong>0:56:49-0:57:09:</strong>  light water you have to share water between each other etc etc you know what you see is  you see a darker green grass larger stems you see taller grass and you see faster response  after grazing it's in a time of drought that's quite fascinating and the trees are some of<br />
<strong>0:57:09-0:57:25:</strong>  them are 200 years old 150 years old mostly so it's quite quite quite inspiring to see  and there's not many of them there's not too you know there's only about maybe of these  large tree maybe 20 per hectare you know yeah and yeah and of course some of the speed<br />
<strong>0:57:25-0:57:46:</strong>  species and I've noticed that particularly around you know some of the acacias because  they pump nitrogen into the soil because they're leguminous and yeah the grass just yeah if  there's enough moisture there the grass will grow really really well grows much faster<br />
<strong>0:57:46-0:58:04:</strong>  the sheep will preferentially eat it and yeah so again you gotta say well you know that's  basically free nitrogen that you're getting that's being incorporated into the soil and  so yeah there is a lot of a lot of benefits associated with that and interestingly you<br />
<strong>0:58:04-0:58:26:</strong>  know to your point is that you know the grass will like die off in it or dry off other parts  first and last underneath the trees and you know I've been thinking about that and you  know is it because they got better because you'd think that they'd be competing for the<br />
<strong>0:58:26-0:58:45:</strong>  water and everything is drying off so you sort of think well how come in an area where  you would think there'd be a lot more competition in terms of for water that is doing so much  better and you know I think there's a few things going on but I've noticed you know<br />
<strong>0:58:45-0:59:05:</strong>  that the grass drives off much less in the shade of the trees so certainly when you get  that harsh winter summer sun I actually think there's a drying effect so it's essentially  creating a microclimate and I personally think that's very very significant in terms of the<br />
<strong>0:59:05-0:59:24:</strong>  impact that slows the wind down so you don't get the same drying effect so you know I think  some of that has got to do with it as well. Yeah and there could be a multiple multitude  of other explanations in terms of hydraulic lift, improved organic matter and you know<br />
<strong>0:59:24-0:59:42:</strong>  soil moisture absorption yeah it's nearly too crazy to think about it hurts the brain  but it's amazing to observe because we just also need to we can observe the results and  we can take you know management decisions based on the results without understanding<br />
<strong>0:59:42-0:59:56:</strong>  all the mechanisms behind it we see greener grass, taller grass and we see longer periods  of time grass it's this is the observation we need to make decisions not necessarily  understanding all of the tiny little details underneath it as intellectually interesting<br />
<strong>0:59:56-1:00:16:</strong>  as that may be. Yeah and I think sometimes I think that's important as a practitioner  is that you observe something you can try and guess what is going on but at the end  of the day it doesn't really matter what matters is the outcome and so via observation<br />
<strong>1:00:16-1:00:30:</strong>  you say well this is the set of circumstances this is what happens and therefore we need  more of that. I mean I would like to talk a lot like we could talk a lot more about  this kind of silver partial system but I wanted to shift gear a bit because I really wanted<br />
<strong>1:00:30-1:00:46:</strong>  to talk to you about two more topics and one of them is the key line pattern that you used  in your olive orchard and the reason is that you know when we're looking at agroforestry  and planting trees one of the big topics is you know how do you orient trees you know<br />
<strong>1:00:46-1:01:02:</strong>  and how do you what direction and how do you organize the tree lines whether it be forestry  whether it be an orchard whether it be a silver pastoral system this is a key topic and actually  finding somebody that has done that and had 20 years of feedback on you know a key line<br />
<strong>1:01:02-1:01:18:</strong>  pattern or maybe it's less I'm not too sure when you planted the orchard exactly but that's  quite unique and special so I'm sure you have quite a bit of feedback to provide on that  and you know to kick it off maybe you could kind of explain to us how you came about planting<br />
<strong>1:01:18-1:01:39:</strong>  a key line pattern you know where did you get the idea from how did what's the story  behind the key line design yeah okay so I right back at the design stage I work closely  with a guy by the name of Darren Doherty who runs in our runs the Regerians platform but<br />
<strong>1:01:39-1:02:06:</strong>  this was way way before then and you know Darren would have to be one of the global  authorities on key line design and you know he's a bit of a master of water in the landscape  and you know essentially we worked on coming up with a design that would work on based<br />
<strong>1:02:06-1:02:30:</strong>  on key line principles and you know basically in terms of the practical implementation of  that is that you end up with your rows of trees just off contour yeah so and as a result  not only is that the olive grove but all the forestry was done on that basis and the silvopast<br />
<strong>1:02:30-1:02:55:</strong>  well the agroforestry in the silvopasture it's done exactly the same way and including  the home orchard so and it works it works well now I've seen some research that talks  about olive trees in terms of you know running the rows north south versus east west yeah<br />
<strong>1:02:55-1:03:14:</strong>  you know and if you run them north south and you know you get slightly higher production  than if you run them east west and yet ours because of the the landscape and the key line  system essentially ours run east west but you know I think you've got to be there's<br />
<strong>1:03:14-1:03:33:</strong>  research and there's research you really need to be careful about what people have actually  studied and get into the nitty-gritty to understand what the conclusions might mean yeah because  yeah most of the research that's been done in this area has been on high density irrigated<br />
<strong>1:03:33-1:03:57:</strong>  trees so you know very close spacing of rows so a lot more shading and as a result you  know if for example we'd gone to a five by five meter grid then you wouldn't know whether  it was north south or east west because it would look the same regardless so because<br />
<strong>1:03:57-1:04:19:</strong>  our rows are eight meters apart so it's an eight by five in actual fact we've overcompensated  potentially for the fact that you know the rows run east west and therefore will not  shade the subsequent row and you know because of the contours of the landscape I have some<br />
<strong>1:04:19-1:04:35:</strong>  trees which run fairly close to north south and those that run almost pure east west and  looked at the production over a period of time and I can't see a discernible difference  based on that.<br />
<strong>1:04:35-1:04:49:</strong>  No I just wanted to say to listeners because it can be quite confusing when we're talking  about key line pattern and etc I mean Campbell and I are familiar with it from the Regrarian's  platform which is by the way a fantastic resource for anything regenerative agriculture highly<br />
<strong>1:04:49-1:05:04:</strong>  advised people joining and checking out what's happening there but also go on Google and  type in key line pattern to get a bit of an understanding visually of what it is because  then you'll be able to visualize more the kind of pattern in which the olive trees of<br />
<strong>1:05:04-1:05:14:</strong>  Campbell are planted so it's definitely something very visual and you'll understand it much  more by just checking out one or two Google photos there so that's just a little notice  on the side.<br />
<strong>1:05:14-1:05:30:</strong>  Sorry for interrupting you Campbell.  No no not at all probably the only other thing I should talk about while we're talking about  key line design and the way in which we set the property up is that and this is something<br />
<strong>1:05:30-1:05:56:</strong>  that Darren would not do now because I've had subsequent conversations with him is that  we did actually deep rip and mound when we planted the olive trees and you know all the  agroforestry blocks and essentially and I subsequently put in a plot with without deep<br />
<strong>1:05:56-1:06:19:</strong>  ripping and mounding of eucalypts so I have a bit of a comparison and you know my experience  with the deep ripping is that yes it does help the trees establish early and therefore  they tend to grow faster at the start.<br />
<strong>1:06:19-1:06:39:</strong>  I reckon that's up to about five years at ten years very little difference.  Now everyone deep rips but you know and if you have a hard pan or a hard layer somewhere  in there you know that may be justified but I'd hate to think that people thought well<br />
<strong>1:06:39-1:06:59:</strong>  I'm not going to plant trees because you know I can't deep rip it for xyz reasons because  I think that given time and this is certainly with eucalypts at least they do tend to catch  up but yeah you get much faster establishment I have no doubt about that.<br />
<strong>1:06:59-1:07:16:</strong>  The other interesting question is around mounding or I think they call them swales in permaculture  is that and again Darren says that if he was doing this design now he wouldn't recommend  it.<br />
<strong>1:07:16-1:07:41:</strong>  From my point of view I think the jury's still out particularly where you've got a keyline  design and the reason I say that is that we're getting much more intense rainfall so even  if we end up with the same amount of rain is that when we get rain it is much more intense.<br />
<strong>1:07:41-1:08:01:</strong>  So we had a thunderstorm recently about a bit over a month ago because it hasn't rained  in the last month and we got 50 millimeters in 50 minutes and most of my soil I have to  say most of my soil has an infiltration rate greater than that so most of it will have<br />
<strong>1:08:01-1:08:27:</strong>  soaked in but I have some areas where the infiltration rate is lower than that and then  you end up with runoff and the advantage of having the mounds there is that it only runs  to the next row essentially and then it just slowly travels along the row and if you slow<br />
<strong>1:08:27-1:08:44:</strong>  it down it'll soak in.  So in that 50 millimeter event the only runoff I had was from hard standing areas.  Off the tree crops, off the olives, not a drop.<br />
<strong>1:08:44-1:08:57:</strong>  Interesting very interesting.  How big are the mounds?  So they're not large they're probably versus the adjacent area of course they've settled<br />
<strong>1:08:57-1:09:16:</strong>  over 20 years they're probably 100 mill 150 mill high so not particularly high but it's  enough it's just enough.  I wouldn't hardly consider that a mound because when you see the mounds that they're planting<br />
<strong>1:09:16-1:09:37:</strong>  in Europe for example in southern Europe I mean when just at planting so young trees  they're nearly 40 50 centimeter high or more sometimes like they really make them out.  Wow yeah yeah and I struggle to understand the reason for that and I'm still I'm investigating<br />
<strong>1:09:37-1:09:54:</strong>  and I'm gonna I'm gonna try work it out but is it for herbicide application it's just  easier to just spray on the sides to keep it clean is it you know we're talking about  super intensive conventional here so not the traditional plantation orchards so but I was<br />
<strong>1:09:54-1:10:06:</strong>  trying to understand the reason for the mounting but yeah so that mound is like it's a minimal  disturbance and it's also a minimal impact on you know applying mulch on the tree line  if that is a you know a technique so it's interesting.<br />
<strong>1:10:06-1:10:29:</strong>  For me when I think about key line and as a tree farmer it's having changes in the in  in straight instead of having a straight line having like a zigzag or curves just seems  to be challenging in terms of you know machinery driving the tractor any you know spraying<br />
<strong>1:10:29-1:10:42:</strong>  as well how do you feel about is it you know do you feel like it's worth it in terms of  the water management improvement in your context is it something that you would if you were  to do it again would you would you apply a once more a key line kind of pattern or would<br />
<strong>1:10:42-1:11:02:</strong>  you go with straight lines I'm very curious.  Yeah so the key line I would do a key line again I don't find it a big problem with the  tractor because you end up with parallel rows it's not as if the rows are not parallel and<br />
<strong>1:11:02-1:11:25:</strong>  I think that's fairly important and yeah I think the way Darren designed it is that you  know that you don't have the rows wandering all over the place doing their own thing is  that the rows are parallel yes they do contour around and but you know when you're spraying<br />
<strong>1:11:25-1:11:51:</strong>  or mulching or whatever if you've got parallel rows and you know you don't have tight turns  then it's it's not really an issue I think probably a bigger issue is things like fences  because they by definition almost they like to be strung in a straight line and you know<br />
<strong>1:11:51-1:12:13:</strong>  once you're putting lots of turns in them but I use a lot of temporary fencing electric  fencing so we're not straining up big distances of wire and in fact you know basically have  very few permanent fences on the place because yeah that just gives me the flexibility to<br />
<strong>1:12:13-1:12:36:</strong>  run the stock where I want to in the density that I want to so you know I think having  flexible fencing but I would have thought that would be a much bigger issue than you  know agricultural machinery the fact that you got parallel rows negates a lot of the<br />
<strong>1:12:36-1:12:49:</strong>  downsides.  That's interesting and you've seen a noticeable improvement in water infiltration especially  I mean the challenge is often in the first years when you're establishing the orchard<br />
<strong>1:12:49-1:13:03:</strong>  there's a lot of disturbance happening often you're starting with quite degraded soil so  less infiltration what's your feedback on what can you tell us on the impact on the  water management which is the original let's say that's the purpose of the technique right?<br />
<strong>1:13:03-1:13:22:</strong>  Yeah yeah absolutely and I think definitely at the start it was absolutely critical is  that I think I mentioned earlier is that you know the from the almost from the day that  we planted the trees we were into the millennium drought and didn't rain significantly for<br />
<strong>1:13:22-1:13:43:</strong>  about eight years and but again when we did get rain it was quite intense you'd end up  with a big thunderstorm and I actually think it was that key line design that actually  ensured that many of the trees survived I think many of them would not have survived<br />
<strong>1:13:43-1:14:02:</strong>  without that arrangement because yeah because the soil I have to say the soil was definitely  not optimal you know it was quite hard it had been hard packed it had been set stocked  you know really it wasn't in great condition and so now with with the infiltration that<br />
<strong>1:14:02-1:14:23:</strong>  we have now in most places yeah it probably it probably doesn't matter Darren is probably  right it probably doesn't matter and you know even having that small mound you could probably  do away with in some areas you'd probably still get some value from it but at the start<br />
<strong>1:14:23-1:14:44:</strong>  you know you haven't improved your soil you haven't built the soil depth you don't get  that sort of infiltration from day one and so you either spend three years probably really  improving your soil getting infiltration you know using some you know intensive grazing<br />
<strong>1:14:44-1:15:04:</strong>  moving often that sort of thing really setting your soil up and probably spending three years  in which to do that and then planting yep that that might be a viable alternative but  of course you've lost three years of growth if you're ultimately looking for you know<br />
<strong>1:15:04-1:15:21:</strong>  some sort of trade crop and I think also it's important to remember that there's context  and context a context with a bit more rainfall and a high a very poor infiltration soil you  may be reaping the benefits of a key line pattern plus mounds for example for many more<br />
<strong>1:15:21-1:15:37:</strong>  years as you are seeing with some of your more degraded areas where still you're seeing  that the mounds are holding back the water and are you know infiltrating or allowing  the water to infiltrate into the landscape slower and not run off so that's also it's<br />
<strong>1:15:37-1:15:59:</strong>  also an interesting observation what is the difference between in your opinion between  the using a mound and ripping for example you know using a let's say we use the the  ripper that is recommended by Darren the the key line plow and you would you would rip<br />
<strong>1:15:59-1:16:17:</strong>  in between the tree lines at strategic points you know at the start of the winter to allow  for infiltration maybe once a year twice a year as compared to a mound what's your what's  your take on this I think it would come back to the context in terms of that there's a<br />
<strong>1:16:17-1:16:41:</strong>  lot of things that are associated with ripping that you know there's potentially some downsides  associated with that but for those soils that have a compacted hard pan particularly if  they've been cropped for a long period of time then quite often you get both a chemical<br />
<strong>1:16:41-1:17:07:</strong>  and physical hard pan and yeah you can grow daikon radish and other plants that will eventually  break that up but I think it is a bit of a speed thing is that you can you know go through  with a key lime plow and get you know pretty much instant results but you know you've got<br />
<strong>1:17:07-1:17:27:</strong>  to follow that up with you know various approaches you know multi-species cropping or whatever  otherwise the soil will tend to tend to revert somewhat so you know it means that you've  got to keep doing it and ultimately I think you'd want to have your soil set up so that<br />
<strong>1:17:27-1:17:47:</strong>  you didn't have to keep doing it every time you do it you know you're disturbing your  mycorrhizal fungi and yeah and I know with the key line it's not a huge amount of disturbance  but underneath like you know it's your tines are like 30 or 60 centimetres apart so you<br />
<strong>1:17:47-1:18:04:</strong>  are ripping through those mycorrhizal threads every time you're doing that and you know  is that the best thing that you can be doing for your soil there's a lot worse things you  could be doing but again I think there's other ways of achieving that and you know right<br />
<strong>1:18:04-1:18:25:</strong>  at the start it may make sense to get back to your question is it better than doing mounds  possibly the advantage of mounds is that and you know I'm not necessarily a huge advocate  I think definitely context but I guess I have seen the benefits of them over a period of<br />
<strong>1:18:25-1:18:38:</strong>  time.  It seems like the mounds would be also a more sensitive soil sensitive approach to allowing  infiltration as compared to regularly ripping for 20 years.<br />
<strong>1:18:38-1:19:02:</strong>  Yeah and yeah and to some extent you know part of the reason we like mounded is that  and this wasn't a huge mound but you know again we wanted to you know provide a nice  bed for to plant the trees into and to stop some of that grass competition that you would<br />
<strong>1:19:02-1:19:19:</strong>  have when you're looking for establishment and so to some extent that's the advantage  of doing the mound is that you end up with you know a nice area to get your tree into  and get it established before it has to start competing with you know some of the allopathic<br />
<strong>1:19:19-1:19:31:</strong>  grasses.  Yeah I was watching some videos on raguerins of yours, no it wasn't it was on your Instagram  and it seemed that you are in quite a windy place like sometimes the olive trees are shaking<br />
<strong>1:19:31-1:19:41:</strong>  a lot.  I know as well on your on your land that you've got a lot of windbreaks and or at least a  few windbreaks and I wanted to discuss a bit with you your experience with these windbreaks.<br />
<strong>1:19:41-1:20:11:</strong>  Yeah so in terms of wind yes it is quite windy and you know partly evidenced by the fact  that we have five wind farms that are located probably within about five kilometers of us.  So yeah because we're in an elevated area we do get a fair amount of wind and that seems<br />
<strong>1:20:11-1:20:37:</strong>  to be increasing both in terms of probably wind speed more than anything and so you know  for example in the last six months our local power company has indicated that they believe  they've had two one in a hundred year events in the last six months.<br />
<strong>1:20:37-1:20:54:</strong>  Now so that's versus you know versus history.  Clearly they're not a one in a hundred year event if you get two in six months yet statistically  yes you can get two in six months and they both won in a hundred year events but it's<br />
<strong>1:20:54-1:21:14:</strong>  unlikely and so you know things are changing and so yeah our wind speed is increasing.  I have to say it was quite windy when we were here at the start and we actually grew quite  a lot of trees around the house and the sheds and those sorts of things just to reduce that<br />
<strong>1:21:14-1:21:42:</strong>  wind speed and that's been incredibly successful because we've got an anaerometer next to the  house and we had wind gusts here getting close to 140 kilometers an hour when we first got  here and we haven't had anything over about 75 kilometers an hour more recently and yet<br />
<strong>1:21:42-1:21:58:</strong>  the local power authority would say that you know we've had worse winds than some time  in the last hundred years.  So certainly the number of trees and the way in which we've placed them has significantly<br />
<strong>1:21:58-1:22:12:</strong>  decreased the wind speed on this property.  It doesn't mean that we don't have wind damage and you know we've lost quite a few trees  in the agroforestry.<br />
<strong>1:22:12-1:22:29:</strong>  To some extent soon after we thinned we had a bit of a windstorm come through and you  know you end up with tall spindly trees which are really exposed to the wind they are much  more likely to snap.<br />
<strong>1:22:29-1:22:47:</strong>  The dynamics of a tree with all the lower branches cut off it is much more likely to  snap and so we've lost quite a number I'd know maybe 20 or 30 brown stringy barks in  particular which seem to be quite prone to that.<br />
<strong>1:22:47-1:23:12:</strong>  But yeah the windbreaks that we've put in place again are a multi-species windbreak.  They typically have both larger trees and smaller trees right down to shrubs so and  you know we tried to get in as many places possible we'll get about three rows.<br />
<strong>1:23:12-1:23:35:</strong>  Ideally we'd have more but you know certainly at three rows you can get a really good mix  of species in there and really slow that wind down.  And you know I think windbreaks are a bit of a misconception is that you're not actually<br />
<strong>1:23:35-1:23:50:</strong>  trying to stop the wind.  You need about 40% of the wind to go through otherwise all you do is create turbulence  either around the sides or over the top and you actually increase the wind speed downwind<br />
<strong>1:23:50-1:24:05:</strong>  of the actual shelterbelt you've put in.  So you know without going into a huge amount of detail there is a bit in shelterbelt design  to make sure that you have some species in there that let the wind through but slow it<br />
<strong>1:24:05-1:24:21:</strong>  down.  And you know species that we've found really really helpful is casuarina.  They have been absolutely fantastic for you know really yeah they let the wind through<br />
<strong>1:24:21-1:24:38:</strong>  but they slow it down.  They've you know to some extent they've got leaves a bit like pine trees so they're needles  and been very very good for you know really slowing the wind down but not blocking it.<br />
<strong>1:24:38-1:24:50:</strong>  They've got fast growth as well don't they?  They do.  Again it comes back to you know how much water they can get but yeah they can grow very very<br />
<strong>1:24:50-1:25:06:</strong>  quickly.  They're often grown around vineyards and things like that because they grow very quickly,  they grow tall and they're great at slowing that wind down even as a single line of trees.<br />
<strong>1:25:06-1:25:15:</strong>  So how thick is your shelterbelt?  You said there's three lines and how far apart are the three lines?  Okay so they're four meters apart.<br />
<strong>1:25:15-1:25:24:</strong>  So that means you've got 12 meters.  Twelve meters and then you'd have some space to the fence.  I'd never recommend putting the trees right on the fence line.<br />
<strong>1:25:24-1:25:34:</strong>  So you want to give yourself some space there so you can access the fence, repair it, whatever.  So typically four meters there as well.  So you have four meters, four meters, four meters.<br />
<strong>1:25:34-1:25:45:</strong>  So yeah you're 12 meters.  Did you follow a specific design or did you just mix species together?  Was there some kind of one line of shrubs you know against the wind, then a medium tree,<br />
<strong>1:25:45-1:25:58:</strong>  then a taller tree?  Is there, do you have any more specifics that you could share with us?  Yeah so we didn't do it quite like that because depending on which shelterbelt we're talking<br />
<strong>1:25:58-1:26:19:</strong>  about but as a general rule although our prevailing wind direction comes out of the north, some  of these wind storms have actually come from other directions.  And so most of the shelterbelts actually have mixed species in each row.<br />
<strong>1:26:19-1:26:32:</strong>  So we really mixed it up in terms of what we wanted to reach row.  And I know you see classic textbooks which has the little shrubs on the outside and then  the bigger ones and then the tall trees.<br />
<strong>1:26:32-1:26:48:</strong>  That always assumes the wind's coming from exactly the same direction.  And I think yeah it looks great in a book but a farm's landscape is not a book and you  don't always have the wind blowing in the same direction.<br />
<strong>1:26:48-1:27:02:</strong>  And you know particularly those strong winds don't necessarily all come from the same direction.  Yeah we've got prominent northern winds in Greece but the strong winds come from the  south.<br />
<strong>1:27:02-1:27:19:</strong>  So the northern wind brings in salt that burns our trees, leaves, because it's in an island.  But the southern wind comes in with a lot of power and breaks branches.  So you've got to be working with both as an example to what you're seeing.<br />
<strong>1:27:19-1:27:35:</strong>  Yeah exactly, exactly.  So I think and given that particularly trees you're talking about a long term sort of once  you put it in it's not easy to change it sort of thing is that, unless you want to start<br />
<strong>1:27:35-1:27:54:</strong>  again, is that I think you've got to recognize that the climate changes, some of the things  that historically might have been true may not be true tomorrow.  And to build as much resilience into your system as you can and not assume that the<br />
<strong>1:27:54-1:28:08:</strong>  winds always gonna, the strong winds are always going to come from the same direction and  those sorts of things.  I think yeah we've got to recognize that the climate is changing and in ways in which we<br />
<strong>1:28:08-1:28:20:</strong>  don't understand and therefore the future is going to look different in ways which we  probably can't envisage.  And therefore I think building as much resilience into your systems as you can makes a lot of<br />
<strong>1:28:20-1:28:28:</strong>  sense.  Yeah for sure that makes a lot of sense.  I'm curious about the species that you chose for your windbreak.<br />
<strong>1:28:28-1:28:35:</strong>  Did you, what were the kind of the traits that you were trying to look for?  Was it fast growth?  Was it?<br />
<strong>1:28:35-1:28:58:</strong>  So part of that was around, really around a few different things is that again we're  looking for that diversity, that biodiversity.  So for example we've got some bursaries which is a really small spiky bush, has amazing<br />
<strong>1:28:58-1:29:21:</strong>  flowers quite heavily scented and it's just a magnet for butterflies for example and is  great for really good protection for small birds, wrens and those sorts of things.  So we had things, we wanted to have things like that that provided that sort of habitat.<br />
<strong>1:29:21-1:29:34:</strong>  We had some small spikier caches.  Again they didn't last terribly long, they only lasted about 10 years.  But again just providing that habitat and still some other stuff got up and growing.<br />
<strong>1:29:34-1:29:56:</strong>  So we had some fast growing acacias, not long lived just to give some initial protection  and then we had some taller trees, we even had some blue gums, so the old Eucalyptus  scolobulus, we had some of those, we have some of those in them.<br />
<strong>1:29:56-1:30:17:</strong>  So that really provides your height and your structure.  So again trying to get it to achieve multiple outcomes and so a lot of biodiversity there  and so a lot of different sorts of habitat for different sorts of bird species in particular<br />
<strong>1:30:17-1:30:31:</strong>  by doing that.  Very interesting, so there was definitely not just an objective of windbreak, there  was an objective of integrating functional biodiversity there and getting these to complement<br />
<strong>1:30:31-1:30:41:</strong>  your ecosystem.  Correct and again when you can do multiple things why would you just do something that's  only going to do one of them?<br />
<strong>1:30:41-1:30:54:</strong>  Is that there's a lot of different things you can achieve with this, why wouldn't you  try and maximize that?  So I expect that you and Darren were also connecting these shelter belts with the forestry<br />
<strong>1:30:54-1:31:11:</strong>  areas and creating a connected ecosystem matrix right?  I can only expect the best from both of you to be honest.  Yes so no absolutely is that just trying to connect everything up as much as possible<br />
<strong>1:31:11-1:31:29:</strong>  so that again it provides that biodiverse pathway that provides an environment for quite  a lot of your bird species in particular.  They don't have to cross a lot of open ground.<br />
<strong>1:31:29-1:31:46:</strong>  So yeah it's connecting it up in that way really makes a big difference.  And I think the other thing just in terms of diversity, the other thing is to think  about diversity like in terms of the sort of species that you're putting in because<br />
<strong>1:31:46-1:32:04:</strong>  to some extent you say well okay the logical thing to do would be to put in indigenous  species because then your indigenous birds and other wildlife are going to have something  which they can you know is part of their natural environment.<br />
<strong>1:32:04-1:32:24:</strong>  One of the interesting things that we saw during the millennium drought was that you  know quite a number of our narrowleaf peppermint gums, so that's Eucalyptus radiata, some  of them were over 200 years old and they died.<br />
<strong>1:32:24-1:32:50:</strong>  So you've got these indigenous species which will no longer survive in this environment  and so you've got to start thinking about well what is the environment going to look  like in 20, 30, 50 years time and will my whatever I'm planting survive in that environment?<br />
<strong>1:32:50-1:33:11:</strong>  And so your best choice may not be an indigenous plant.  And I know a lot of people get quite excited about planting indigenous plants and absolutely  it's appropriate but again just in terms of looking for that diversity and the resilience<br />
<strong>1:33:11-1:33:30:</strong>  of your landscape over time you just need to think about you know will some of these  species survive?  And yeah I was quite surprised is that we lost quite a number of you know trees that<br />
<strong>1:33:30-1:33:44:</strong>  had, yeah when I cut them up for firewood, you know there was a lot of rings there.  So they'd been around, they'd seen a lot of droughts, seen a lot of floods, they'd seen  a lot of stuff but they couldn't survive this one.<br />
<strong>1:33:44-1:33:58:</strong>  Typically they'll last 300 plus years so it wasn't as if they'd like reached the end of  their useful life it's just that the environment had changed and they could no longer survive  in the environment.<br />
<strong>1:33:58-1:34:14:</strong>  Another element to that conversation is also the treatment, the soil treatment that the  previous owner for example had created.  So for example by, we're seeing this a lot in the Montado, you've got very sensitive<br />
<strong>1:34:14-1:34:25:</strong>  environments to Mediterranean climate, it's brittle, it's sensitive.  You have then a lot of overgrazing because you have you know more animals than there  were before to have more productive systems.<br />
<strong>1:34:25-1:34:40:</strong>  You have hay now, you have feed that you can buy cheap so people put more animals on their  land, soil conditions deteriorate and then the oak trees they struggle.  Complement that with the more irregular rainfall, reduced rainfall etc, the pattern that we<br />
<strong>1:34:40-1:34:56:</strong>  see in the Mediterranean climate throughout and you get old trees that should be living  much longer that are starting to, the tips start to dry, you know they start to be, the  illnesses start to affect them and we see that kind of slow decline.<br />
<strong>1:34:56-1:35:06:</strong>  And yeah that's something that's important to take note of as well.  It's not just the climate it's also this recent intensification of management and the cost  on the soil.<br />
<strong>1:35:06-1:35:24:</strong>  Yeah and I think that's and that happens over a long period of time so the fact they actually  died on our watch doesn't necessarily mean it was the conditions right then.  Sure it was a dry period but yeah absolutely the soil being compacted over a long period<br />
<strong>1:35:24-1:35:41:</strong>  of time, yeah potentially overgrazed etc etc.  So yeah I take your point entirely.  But I think you know one of the other interviewees Rowan Reid, you know one of the things that<br />
<strong>1:35:41-1:35:56:</strong>  he's been talking about in terms of his agroforestry plots is that he is now planting through a  lot of trees that will survive under a lower rainfall environment and just because this  part of the world is going to be a lot drier.<br />
<strong>1:35:56-1:36:16:</strong>  And so you know again you need to think about that in terms of your shelterbelts, just the  sort of things that you do is you know am I planting a resilient structure here that's  you know going to last for the longer term particularly around trees because they last<br />
<strong>1:36:16-1:36:31:</strong>  a relatively long time.  Although having said that there's you know some of the grasses, we've got a riparian  zone and some of the grasses there like kangaroo grass which is you know it can live to be<br />
<strong>1:36:31-1:36:49:</strong>  100 years old.  So you know it's almost like a tree in that respect is that it's you know it's yeah yeah  so and you know it's so and there's some of that grassland that you know we've lost most<br />
<strong>1:36:49-1:37:12:</strong>  of it and you know so it's really important to maintain that biodiversity and keep some  of those species because it's interesting is that that particular species it's not just  indigenous to Australia or native to Australia it's also grows in Africa.<br />
<strong>1:37:12-1:37:35:</strong>  I think it's called red grass over there or Afrikaans as rural grass and you know it has  20% protein like it could be one of those plants that provides a huge amount of you  know feed for us as the climate dries out because you know kangaroo grass will survive<br />
<strong>1:37:35-1:37:49:</strong>  in both wet environments and dry environments.  It's very very good at that and so it's much more resilient grass than a lot of the ones  that you know like wheat notes and barley and rye and stuff.<br />
<strong>1:37:49-1:38:07:</strong>  So again you know it we really need to be careful that we don't lose some of these species  because we may ultimately depend on them for our survival.  Shifting a bit back to the multi-functionality of the landscape or of the shelterbelts, have<br />
<strong>1:38:07-1:38:17:</strong>  you expected to extract a product from there?  Are you expecting to harvest some kind of wood, timber, wood chips, anything from that  shelter belt?<br />
<strong>1:38:17-1:38:40:</strong>  Definitely so we planted some of the species there we planted because they're really good  for nectar so potential honey production and I would imagine that some of the blue gums  will take out from time to time and that'll be you know we'll just take one out one back<br />
<strong>1:38:40-1:38:53:</strong>  type stuff.  So they haven't been high pruned for timber but you know they've probably got four or  five meters to the first branch and because again a lot of you know a lot of the shrubs<br />
<strong>1:38:53-1:39:17:</strong>  and stuff force them to grow up and so essentially they self prune for the first four or five  meters and so you know I think we'll get some timber out of them as well.  So yeah it's we'll and interestingly some of the casuarina that we planted in there<br />
<strong>1:39:17-1:39:39:</strong>  so your bull oaks and those sorts of things you got a wonderful large seed and you know  you can use those give them a silver spray and they make great Christmas tree decorations.  So you know there's lots of things you can do with you know some of the plants that we<br />
<strong>1:39:39-1:39:54:</strong>  have in our shelter belts and you know the opportunities are there you just got to have  the time and resources to go ask them.  I have one final question about windbreaks and I think it's also one of the key things<br />
<strong>1:39:54-1:40:15:</strong>  that comes out with it it's you know how does the windbreak system interact with the olive  trees have you noticed a serious impact on olive tree productivity closer to the windbreak  due to either reduced wind speed microclimate or also competition between the windbreak<br />
<strong>1:40:15-1:40:28:</strong>  and the olive trees have you noticed that there is there is some kind of competitive  relationship going on and maybe in closer proximity.  I don't know I'm very curious about your observations with between the olive trees and the shelter<br />
<strong>1:40:28-1:40:36:</strong>  belts.  Yeah slowing the wind speed down has helped and typically that slows the wind speed down  for quite a number of rows.<br />
<strong>1:40:36-1:41:02:</strong>  The rows closest to the shelter belt we only have a couple of places where the rows are  almost parallel to the shelter belt and planted quite closely in actual fact and definitely  there is a production impact and not initially but as the olive trees grew up more.<br />
<strong>1:41:02-1:41:24:</strong>  Now in one case I have like two specific cases that come to mind in one case it's because  the shelter belt shades the olive trees and olive trees don't like to be shaded that definitely  affects production so because the shelter belt has grown a lot higher than the olive<br />
<strong>1:41:24-1:41:41:</strong>  trees and as a result the trees are in shade a lot more of the time that definitely has  an impact on production no question about it.  In the other case I think it might be a moisture issue although the trees are big and healthy<br />
<strong>1:41:41-1:42:07:</strong>  so that suggests not and I haven't actually really yeah the trees are probably as big  as any of them which suggests that it's not a water competition issue so it may be a pollination  issue is that the shelter belt because they're a wind pollinated tree and by definition the<br />
<strong>1:42:07-1:42:23:</strong>  shelter belt may in fact be you know slowing the wind speed down enough there's not enough  pollen in that particular area to pollinate the trees.  I'm not 100% sure I don't think it's a war even though it's quite dry underneath the<br />
<strong>1:42:23-1:42:45:</strong>  trees are really well grown so I don't I don't believe it's a water stress issue but yeah  it's interesting where they are quite close together like at one point yeah the shelter  belt probably gets within five meters of the olive trees and so yeah I'm hypothesizing<br />
<strong>1:42:45-1:42:57:</strong>  that maybe the shelter belt just slows the wind speed down too much that they're not  getting that pollination.  That's an effect that you're seeing just on the on the closest row or is that something<br />
<strong>1:42:57-1:43:17:</strong>  effect you're seeing throughout a few rows?  Yeah yeah absolutely interestingly the next row is one of my best rows so it's like it's  ones that are hard up against the actual shelter belt I actually do see an effect and as I<br />
<strong>1:43:17-1:43:35:</strong>  said it only runs parallel to it for a short period of time so it's probably 20 trees maybe  and those 20 trees definitely are affected from a production point of view.  It's amazing to be able to have these observations because also you know you're managing it's<br />
<strong>1:43:35-1:43:53:</strong>  still relatively big for an olive you know crop cultivation but you're intimately interacting  with most of those trees and that is quite some incredible feedback I wasn't expecting  such a detailed answer yeah it's amazing.<br />
<strong>1:43:53-1:44:15:</strong>  I think yeah really as a land manager that's our biggest single skill it's about observation  and so it's a matter of seeing things and I guess with that being intentionally curious  is that why is that happening why is it like that?<br />
<strong>1:44:15-1:44:35:</strong>  So yeah I think in terms of the windbreak and the observations what's really hard to  understand is the general impact of the forestry agroforestry shelter belts etc on the productivity  of your landscape because it can be small details where you know it's changes through<br />
<strong>1:44:35-1:44:51:</strong>  time that we can't observe we don't have a control which is like you know we're interacting  with so it's but we can only hypothesize and what I'm feeling from also the conversation  that we just had it's that you know you're really feeling you know you're seeing that<br />
<strong>1:44:51-1:45:07:</strong>  there is an ecosystem is created and with the different tree plantings that you've put  around the place you've managed to you are improving your production.  I think that's absolutely right I think there's it's synergistic in terms of the way in which<br />
<strong>1:45:07-1:45:32:</strong>  each of the parts work with each other and you know I think that overall you end up with  a better outcome as a result and it's difficult to quantify in terms of you know what those  sorts of things might be but you know one of those windstorms that came through is that<br />
<strong>1:45:32-1:45:55:</strong>  there was a property not far from here they had it was actually a forestry plot south  facing slope and they lost every single tree like every single tree got flattened and you  know what we lost one olive tree so you know it's almost like yeah it's pretty much the<br />
<strong>1:45:55-1:46:22:</strong>  same wind it was certainly howling and yet one we lost one tree so it's yeah I think  the various parts pull together to you know create an environment that is much more nurturing  and enables all the different parts to prosper.<br />
<strong>1:46:22-1:46:37:</strong>  I think that's a beautiful way to finish the interview yeah very good I'm very grateful  for your time it's really incredible thank you.  No not at all I was really happy to share my passion so no the joy was all mine.<br />
