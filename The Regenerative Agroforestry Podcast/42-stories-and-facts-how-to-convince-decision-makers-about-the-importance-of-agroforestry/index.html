  <h1>42 Stories And Facts How To Convince Decision Makers About The Importance Of Agroforestry</h1>

<p><strong>0:00:00-0:00:23:</strong>  Can we change the way we produce food to both meet the needs of humans whilst regenerating  our soils and ecosystems?  And can we do so in a way that improves the financial viability of farms?<br />
<strong>0:00:23-0:00:34:</strong>  These questions are becoming increasingly urgent to answer and we're here to investigate  a promising technique called agroforestry in order to find out how it can help us with  these challenges.<br />
<strong>0:00:34-0:00:48:</strong>  We'll be interviewing farmers, scientists and other experts to share with you their  experiences, practical advice and scientific research.  Welcome to the Regenerative Agroforestry podcast.<br />
<strong>0:00:48-0:00:59:</strong>  I'm your host Etienne.  Today I have the pleasure of welcoming Patrick Worms onto the show.  He is a policy advisor for World Agroforestry and the president of the European Agroforestry<br />
<strong>0:00:59-0:01:12:</strong>  Federation.  We discuss together agroforestry but from a policy perspective to understand how we  can convince decision makers and what type of funding is needed to scale agroforestry.<br />
<strong>0:01:12-0:01:23:</strong>  Although much of the conversation is focused on Europe, Patrick gives some insights that  will be of great interest to anyone who wants to convince key players of the opportunity  that agroforestry represents.<br />
<strong>0:01:23-0:01:32:</strong>  Patrick is an amazing speaker and you will find that this interview is not only highly  informative but also very entertaining and full of punchlines.  Enjoy.<br />
<strong>0:01:32-0:01:38:</strong>  Hi, Patrick.  Welcome to the podcast.  Thank you.<br />
<strong>0:01:38-0:01:50:</strong>  So you know you're a bit of an unusual guest but a bit different from the farmers we usually  interview.  So why don't you just tell us who you are and what you do in life?<br />
<strong>0:01:50-0:02:03:</strong>  Thank you Etienne.  Well I'm Patrick Worms, I'm a German citizen who lives in Belgium and here I represent  World Agroforestry which is a research institution headquartered in Nairobi, Kenya where I am<br />
<strong>0:02:03-0:02:14:</strong>  the senior science policy advisor.  I'm also the president of the European Agroforestry Federation.  I'm now in my second term and the board will be renewed in New Orleans so I'm looking forward<br />
<strong>0:02:14-0:02:29:</strong>  to passing the baton on to somebody else at the European Agroforestry Conference which  will be happening this May in Sardinia in Italy.  And how did you first get involved with agroforestry?<br />
<strong>0:02:29-0:02:49:</strong>  Well 12 years ago I was helping a friend organize what was the United Arab Emirates very first  global conference devoted to environmental issues, a conference called Eye on Earth.  And there I listened to a fascinating presentation by Professor Dennis Garrity whom some of you<br />
<strong>0:02:49-0:03:02:</strong>  audience will know.  He was director general of World Agroforestry at the time.  And Dennis made a presentation that explains the wonderful capabilities and impact of mixing<br />
<strong>0:03:02-0:03:10:</strong>  crops with trees.  And as a biologist because I'm trained as a geneticist that was immediately obvious  to me.<br />
<strong>0:03:10-0:03:19:</strong>  The other thing that was obvious to me is that even though I spent all of my career  dealing with environmental issues I had never even heard the World Agroforestry before Dennis  mentioned it.<br />
<strong>0:03:19-0:03:31:</strong>  So I thought these guys needed some help.  At the time I just sold my own lobbying company here in Brussels so I was flushed not enough  to stop working for the rest of my life but enough not to have to worry about my income<br />
<strong>0:03:31-0:03:41:</strong>  for a few months.  And so I started lobbying for agroforestry here in Brussels not realizing what it was  really within a few months I realized I really needed to learn more.<br />
<strong>0:03:41-0:03:54:</strong>  So I got on a flight to Nairobi told my wife I'd be there for a couple of weeks I ended  up staying a couple of months then it took me down to Zambia and to Malawi to get a better  Zimbabwe to get a better understanding of what this agroforestry stuff is.<br />
<strong>0:03:54-0:04:02:</strong>  And at the end of that it was agreed that it would be useful if I carried on working  with them but I couldn't carry on doing it for free forever.  And so they signed a contract with me and that was 11 years ago.<br />
<strong>0:04:02-0:04:14:</strong>  So that's how I got into agroforestry.  I was an environmentally concerned individual who had been doing environmental remediation  projects mostly in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union for decades who<br />
<strong>0:04:14-0:04:34:</strong>  understood a little bit about lobbying about corporate lobbying and about government lobbying  and who was fascinated by what was what struck me at the time and still remains an absolutely  extraordinary way of managing landscapes for both human ends and ecosystem agains.<br />
<strong>0:04:34-0:04:46:</strong>  And what elements really you know it's interesting to hear a journey going from lobbyists to  all of a sudden getting this sudden interest for agroforestry.  What elements specifically kind of appeal to you?<br />
<strong>0:04:46-0:04:54:</strong>  Were they on the purely ecological level or did you also see social benefits?  I mean what caught your eye?  All of the above.<br />
<strong>0:04:54-0:05:12:</strong>  What really the first thing that struck me was the sheer elegance of a system that rotates  nutrients gases and water in a far more efficient way across its components than a monocrop  system ever could simply because you have more roots they go deeper you have a bigger<br />
<strong>0:05:12-0:05:24:</strong>  crown so you have bigger ecosystemic effects.  The second thing that struck me and that was right at the same time because Dennis was  speaking about agroforestry in the West African Sahelian context was the extraordinary impact<br />
<strong>0:05:24-0:05:38:</strong>  this had on social and economic benefits because these are environments in which I mean yeah  if you have oodles of capital if you're a millionaire you can sink a well and you can  use diesel and you can use pesticides and fertilizers and all the rest of it and you<br />
<strong>0:05:38-0:05:47:</strong>  can grow stuff in the Sahel but local farmers don't operate like that they're too poor and  in that environment unless you have trees it's really difficult to grow anything at  all.<br />
<strong>0:05:47-0:05:59:</strong>  The trees provide you with fertility with protection against drought with protection  against storms etc etc etc etc.  So right from the start I had this this vision of a system that was benefiting both the farmers<br />
<strong>0:05:59-0:06:14:</strong>  and the people living on a piece of land and the wider community and by wider community  I don't mean the wider human community I mean the wider community of life the animals the  plants the microbiome etc I.e. all the bits and pieces that we don't normally think about<br />
<strong>0:06:14-0:06:24:</strong>  but that make the difference between a living and a dead planet.  Tell us a bit more about your job today at the World Agroforestry what do your daily  tasks look like?<br />
<strong>0:06:24-0:06:41:</strong>  My daily tasks are really to do two things first is to influence policy and influencing  policy means ensuring that development funding for example goes more into an agroecological  direction than into an intensive agricultural direction.<br />
<strong>0:06:41-0:06:57:</strong>  It means trying to influence the way that certain strategic documents are being drafted  or are being prepared so for example you can see the imprimatur of the work that we do  in the European Union's biodiversity strategy the European Union's forestry strategy or<br />
<strong>0:06:57-0:07:10:</strong>  the European Union's farm to fork strategies all of which mention agroforestry as a pretty  good way of managing landscapes.  We try to integrate agroforestry into different bits of policy whenever we can so for example<br />
<strong>0:07:10-0:07:27:</strong>  the director general for climate at the European Commission has identified carbon farming as  something we need to do in order to get to grips with the carbon greed we all have and  to identify the key interventions within carbon farming they commissioned some consultants<br />
<strong>0:07:27-0:07:41:</strong>  who work with them and the result is peatland rewetting and agroforestry.  So it doesn't matter which way you look at this whether you look at it from the perspective  of productivity whether you look at it from the perspective of resilience whether you<br />
<strong>0:07:41-0:07:52:</strong>  look at it from the perspective of social issues whether you look at it from the perspective  of biodiversity or whether you look at it from the perspective of climate agroforestry  always comes back as a pretty good option.<br />
<strong>0:07:52-0:08:02:</strong>  What are your tools to convince people about agroforestry what are the decision makers  looking for and you know how can you push forward this agenda?  A story.<br />
<strong>0:08:02-0:08:14:</strong>  A story backed by good scientific evidence.  You're not going to get anywhere if all you do is send people scientific papers and World  Agroforestry is an institution that does research so that publishes scientific papers I think<br />
<strong>0:08:14-0:08:30:</strong>  by now we have over 7,000 peer reviewed papers to our name but papers don't change policy  what does change policy is the ability to tell a story built on those papers so that  people can envision a different future from the current trend that they're on.<br />
<strong>0:08:30-0:08:44:</strong>  Policymakers want to make the world a better place within the regulatory constraints within  they have to operate their bureaucrats and bureaucrats have to operate within the rules  that other bureaucrats have prepared but within those rules they want to chippy the rest of<br />
<strong>0:08:44-0:09:00:</strong>  us in the right direction so they are going to be encouraging the adoption of agroforestry  if they can see the evidence that agroforestry works but in order for them to sit down and  spend an hour or two going through papers to convince themselves that agroforestry works<br />
<strong>0:09:00-0:09:15:</strong>  you need to give them an opening you need to give them the possibility of doing so and  you do that through stories and that means that you give them visions it's images it's  simple graphs it's photographs it's podcasts it's presentations it's simple things things<br />
<strong>0:09:15-0:09:29:</strong>  that make them go hey what is this agroforestry stuff why is it so important in other words  things that make people react in much the way that I reacted to Dennis Garrity's presentation  in Abu Dhabi all these years ago.<br />
<strong>0:09:29-0:09:43:</strong>  Dennis is also very good at telling stories.  And what always uh struck me is that um what always you know I found very powerful is that  both agroforestry but more widely regenerative agriculture have a amazing story to tell right<br />
<strong>0:09:43-0:09:57:</strong>  and most of us that got into it were taken into that story and through emotion rather  than facts so totally understand where you're coming from with that.  Yeah but it's it's important to understand that we didn't stay with it with the regenerative<br />
<strong>0:09:57-0:10:13:</strong>  agriculture story or the agroforestry story or the agroecology story because of the emotions  we stayed with it because the facts corroborated our emotions we looked at it and we thought  hey this sounds great this is wonderful this is a way in which we can save the planet but<br />
<strong>0:10:13-0:10:27:</strong>  then the next reaction is does it actually work or am I just being taken for a ride and  that's when you go through the books when you go through the papers when you talk to  people who are doing it and when you begin to understand more and more what it can and<br />
<strong>0:10:27-0:10:44:</strong>  what it cannot do and that reinforces the belief if you like it reinforces the story  and that is why regenerative agriculture is growing despite the fact that we have practically  no money for marketing unlike the agrochemical industry which this year is reckoned to be<br />
<strong>0:10:44-0:11:01:</strong>  spending about 245 billion dollars on sorry to have a revenue of about 245 billion dollars  outside of China so that's just the rest of the world and we don't have and of course  they operate these companies operate like pharma companies which means about 40% of<br />
<strong>0:11:01-0:11:15:</strong>  their revenue goes into marketing distribution etc rather than research and we don't have  that resource the only thing we have is a better story than that but the story is convincing  more and more farmers.<br />
<strong>0:11:15-0:11:28:</strong>  So you know that's your day job and as a president of URAF do you do similar missions then or  how does that compare?  Yeah it's very it's a very similar mission and my bosses in Nairobi understand that I'm<br />
<strong>0:11:28-0:11:47:</strong>  pursuing their objective as well when I am worrying about European agroforestry so at  URAF we really try to do two things first we try to encourage Europe's agroforesters  and the membership is I guess about two-thirds academic one-third farmers to get better at<br />
<strong>0:11:47-0:12:01:</strong>  talking about agroforestry in their own national context that means we have regular monthly  meetings where we exchange information where we see what's happening in different countries  etc the second thing that we try to do is to help them win research contracts two-thirds<br />
<strong>0:12:01-0:12:14:</strong>  in academics, academics run from one grant to another it's a pretty hard life and I mean  farmers and academics are probably the two job descriptions that have the hardest life  in Europe at the moment and both of them are in URAF so what we're trying to do is to put<br />
<strong>0:12:14-0:12:29:</strong>  in place these these consortia these groupings of universities and practitioners and farms  etc that together want to research some aspect of agroforestry and win some funding usually  at the European level from from DG research.<br />
<strong>0:12:29-0:12:44:</strong>  So those are the two main things that we do the third thing that we do is of course what  I've already talked about the the lobbying side and trying to influence policy and that's  fiendishly hard because you can convince some bureaucrats in Brussels-Burg and story but<br />
<strong>0:12:44-0:12:59:</strong>  when the decision-making is distributed across all the member states of the European Union  suddenly it becomes much much harder and that was the flaw in the farm to fork strategy  the farm to fork strategy says all the right things about agroforestry but the farm to<br />
<strong>0:12:59-0:13:16:</strong>  fork strategy asks for the member states to create their own strategic plans because they  know better what works in their local context which is of course true but at the same time  deeply flawed because the ministries of agriculture inside these member states are the main point<br />
<strong>0:13:16-0:13:31:</strong>  of contact for the agrochemical industry across Europe that's where the decisions are taken  about what to authorize what not to authorize what to sell how to sell it how to buy where  the subsidies go etc etc so and and there we have no voice or very very little voice<br />
<strong>0:13:31-0:13:50:</strong>  since we don't have lobbyists in every capital of the European Union and so the strategic  plans that came back from the from those capitals are by and large extremely discouraging documents  of several thousand pages that mention agroforestry once or twice and that's why and I'm sure<br />
<strong>0:13:50-0:14:08:</strong>  that many of you listeners know this that's why the fear now is that under the new common  agricultural policy and its strategic plans we're going to actually take a step back in  agroecological terms rather than a step forward and that is now being encouraged by the fact<br />
<strong>0:14:08-0:14:24:</strong>  that the agrochemical industry is using the excuse of the Russia's invasion of Ukraine  to try to encourage Europe to double down on more fertilizers more pesticides more diesel  and less ecological bullshit. And so what do you see in the new cap policy that actually<br />
<strong>0:14:24-0:14:40:</strong>  takes things backwards rather than forwards? Not in the policy at European level it's more  what's coming back from the member states in the in terms of the strategic plans you  could say that the one thing that's taking things backwards at the European level is<br />
<strong>0:14:40-0:14:56:</strong>  the fact that the bureaucrats who develop a farm to fork strategy do not seem to have  realized that by giving so much freedom back to the member states that some of the things  that they wanted to happen on the agroecological front in Brussels since it isn't a mandate<br />
<strong>0:14:56-0:15:14:</strong>  but just one option amongst many was going to get abandoned. They may not have fully  realized that this is what was going to happen and that is what has happened. In most states  the measures to promote agroforestry are laughable. In the Czech Republic for example which under<br />
<strong>0:15:14-0:15:34:</strong>  its previous Ministry of Agriculture was actually quite pro agroforestry you now have a proposal  where only 0.02% of the agricultural surface of the country should be transformed into  agroforestry in the next five years. In other words nothing. Our Czech colleagues the Czech<br />
<strong>0:15:34-0:15:53:</strong>  Agroforestry Federation has enough requests from farmers to consume the five-year resource  the Czech government is planning to spend on the strategic on the agroforestry part of  the strategic plan within a year. So and that's only three farms. Three farms want to do agroforestry<br />
<strong>0:15:53-0:16:08:</strong>  and that would already consume all of the finances the Czech Republic is planning to  allocate to agroforestry over the next five years within one year. That's how little the  promotion of agroforestry is in the Czech Republic and we see that being repeated in<br />
<strong>0:16:08-0:16:24:</strong>  other countries as well. Ministries of agriculture are just not taking it seriously. Brussels  is taking it seriously but national ministries of agriculture are not and that's a foundational  problem. It's a fundamental problem because it means that farmers who want to transfer<br />
<strong>0:16:24-0:16:39:</strong>  to agroforestry not only are they not going to get the subsidies but very often they're  not going to get the technical advice that they need and as we all know agroforestry  sounds beautiful but the practice is not always easy. You need to know what tree to plant,<br />
<strong>0:16:39-0:16:52:</strong>  how to plant them, how to prune them, how to fertilize them, how to water them, what  distance to plant them, what the market is like etc etc etc etc and you need to know  all that before you even start planting your very first tree. Where are farmers going to<br />
<strong>0:16:52-0:17:12:</strong>  get that advice from? They're not getting it from the public advisory bodies which are  all into productivist agriculture. They might get it from activists, from NGOs and from  other farmers who are doing it but by definition these are a not very numerous and b concentrated.<br />
<strong>0:17:12-0:17:27:</strong>  Typically when you have an agroforestry somewhere you have other agroforestries in the neighborhood  and when you don't have any agroforestry at all you don't have any agroforestry for hundreds  of kilometers and it is in these places without any agroforestry at all of course that most<br />
<strong>0:17:27-0:17:43:</strong>  of the heavy lifting needs to be done and that's just not happening. We will come back  later on to you know how we can try and leverage and scale agroforestry but first I wanted  to get a sense of how things have evolved throughout your career. I mean from what I<br />
<strong>0:17:43-0:17:58:</strong>  understand policymakers have been more and more you know sensitive and have at the European  level have started to listen but now we're still at a point where we need to see like  scaling it up. How has it changed throughout your career lobbying for agroforestry and<br />
<strong>0:17:58-0:18:19:</strong>  working on it? It's been positive. To caricature 10 years ago people would not take my calls.  Today I get the calls. I don't have to call people. So there is a much greater interest  now in these techniques than there were 10 years ago and that's not just because of the<br />
<strong>0:18:19-0:18:34:</strong>  work that we've been doing it's because of the work that a lot of other people have been  doing. For example I don't know if you've seen the latest adaptation report of the IPCC.  I mean these are thousands of scientists who review hundreds of thousands of papers and<br />
<strong>0:18:34-0:18:47:</strong>  their conclusion on the land based stuff is agroecology rocks. Agroecology is better for  productivity it's better for adaptation it's better for resilience it's better for biodiversity  it's better for social things and then they have these wonderful two words between brackets<br />
<strong>0:18:47-0:19:04:</strong>  high confidence. What that means is the scientists have reviewed all of these studies and the  conclusions are very very sound. This is not you know daring science at the edge somewhere  that may or may be proven wrong in the future may or may not be proven wrong in the future.<br />
<strong>0:19:04-0:19:20:</strong>  This is settled science which a large community of scientists have concluded with high confidence  is the way to go. And that kind of message keeps on coming back time and time and time  again. Then we also know the FAO keeps on repeating and how much land degradation there<br />
<strong>0:19:20-0:19:36:</strong>  is. The IPCC keeps on repeating how much how many emissions are connected to the food systems.  There was a food system summit that looked at these things as well. So at the United  Nations level. So you do have an understanding at an international policy level that business<br />
<strong>0:19:36-0:19:53:</strong>  as usual simply doubling down with better seeds and better pesticides and better fertilizers  and better machinery GPS control and what have you. Yeah well it helps but at the margins  it doesn't it's not transformative. And right now margins don't work anymore. If we simply<br />
<strong>0:19:53-0:20:09:</strong>  do things at the margin we're turning this planet into hell. We need complete transformation  and in the agricultural system complete transformation does not mean replacing intensive agriculture  with agroecology. It means adding agroecology to the toolbox. Your trees are not there to<br />
<strong>0:20:09-0:20:21:</strong>  replace your tractors. Your trees are there to work with your tractors. And with a bit  of luck thanks to your trees you'll need to spend less on fertilizer and you'll need to  spend less on pesticides. And at the end you can harvest the timber and make some extra<br />
<strong>0:20:21-0:20:35:</strong>  money. That's the foundational promise of agroforestry for a farmer. But unless that  message comes out again and again and again so that farmers actually after a hard day's  work go on to Google to try to find out a little bit more about what that agroforestry<br />
<strong>0:20:35-0:20:53:</strong>  stuff is all about. This is not going to happen. But who is pushing back? I know you mentioned  the agro business beforehand but if the tree is not there. They're not pushing back. They  don't have to worry about it. Nobody's pushing back against agroforestry. Agroforestry is<br />
<strong>0:20:53-0:21:09:</strong>  like dieting. Everybody thinks it's a good idea and nobody does it. You know they're  not but they are not talking about it either. Go to a farm supply shop. What do you see?  The posters, the leaflets, the brochures. They're all about the latest seed, the latest<br />
<strong>0:21:09-0:21:25:</strong>  chemical, the latest machine, whatever you have. They're not about planting trees. They're  not about agroecology. They're not about agroforestry. And the reason is simple to understand. If  I'm in the business of making money from farmers I can do so very easily by selling them a<br />
<strong>0:21:25-0:21:41:</strong>  bag of stuff with a label about how it works and maybe add a nice app that they can have  on their phone so they know exactly what to spray when for what condition. And I can package  it with gorgeous marketing and everybody buys because it works. But if instead I want to<br />
<strong>0:21:41-0:21:57:</strong>  teach a farmer how to plant some trees I can't scale it. I can't run out 500,000 consultants  out of a factory and send them into the landscape. I need to train individuals. These individuals  need to spend time with the farmers. And because most farmers have not yet done any agroforestry<br />
<strong>0:21:57-0:22:11:</strong>  it's extremely intensive time. You need to sit down with them time and time again to  discuss it, to go through their fears, to go through their hopes, to begin to figure  out what the plant is going to look like, to design it, to help them plant. Who is going<br />
<strong>0:22:11-0:22:24:</strong>  to pay for that? They're not going to pay for that because they're not yet convinced  that this is going to make them money. The state is not paying for it because the state  has basically privatized extension services which are mostly about productivist issues.<br />
<strong>0:22:24-0:22:38:</strong>  Agricultural colleges are not going to pay for it or do it because agricultural colleges  are in partnership with big ag are focused mostly on better seeds and better management  and better pesticides and better chemicals and better machinery and more GPS and drones<br />
<strong>0:22:38-0:22:52:</strong>  and tractors and robots. So who's going to do it? Nobody is doing it. That's why agroforestry  doesn't spread. It's not because people hate it, it's because people ignore it.  But from what I understand from what you say is that today we have a European level which<br />
<strong>0:22:52-0:23:08:</strong>  is pretty proactive, has been convinced to a certain extent. To a certain extent. But  certain individuals in the policy circles at least have seen the value and have tried  to push that in European policy. Then we have the farm level where we have more and more<br />
<strong>0:23:08-0:23:24:</strong>  farmers that are interested to try it out, your example in the Czech Republic. And the  level that's kind of blocking at the moment is more the state level with agricultural  ministries that have privileged access for lobbies of the agro industry. And I'm wondering<br />
<strong>0:23:24-0:23:40:</strong>  if that level, the nation level, is the level that's blocking, what's missing there then?  Is it that they haven't been convinced by the story? Is it that they actually are trying  to block it to favour another type? Like how can you, where do you see the blockage?<br />
<strong>0:23:40-0:23:59:</strong>  Well, at several levels. First, they don't hear the story. You need strong, proactive,  vibrant activist agroforestry federations or agroecology federations or regenerative  agricultural federations inside these countries that are rich enough to pay for people to<br />
<strong>0:23:59-0:24:16:</strong>  go and sit in these ministries regularly to prepare the stories, to prepare the brochures,  to have the meetings, to organise the cocktails, to take people to dinner, to build the relationships.  That's missing. That's missing almost everywhere. The second thing that's necessary is the ability<br />
<strong>0:24:16-0:24:35:</strong>  to analyse and take apart the work that's being done by the agro industrial lobbying  that ignores agroecological things. It's never about demonising pesticides or demonising  fertilisers. These are, every farmer knows, these are tools that are extremely powerful<br />
<strong>0:24:35-0:24:50:</strong>  and I'm glad they're in the toolbox. It's about understanding that if the only thing  you do is focus on those tools, you end up with a land degradation, the land erosion,  the emissions and the high debts that are bedeviling today's European farming. You have<br />
<strong>0:24:50-0:25:06:</strong>  to add agroecology to that, not replace one with the other. Then it's up to every farmer  to decide how he or she wants to go down that journey. Some farmers will just be happy to  have monoclonal rows of poplars in their wheat fields. It's already much better than having<br />
<strong>0:25:06-0:25:20:</strong>  a simple wheat field, right? It's the simplest form of agroforestry. Others will go full  hog and do syntropic permaculture and that's great. It's much better. It's much more productive.  It's better for the soil, blah, blah, blah, but it requires a completely different way<br />
<strong>0:25:20-0:25:34:</strong>  of thinking. The first kind of farming, you do it much as you did before. You don't have  to increase your labour that much. The one with the poplars. The whole syntropic permaculture  thing. We can forget about using machinery and we need lots of people. It's a completely<br />
<strong>0:25:34-0:25:47:</strong>  different way of farming. And that too is what a good agroforestry advisor does. And  a good agroforestry advisor does not come into your farm and ask you what tree would  you like to plant? A good agroforestry advisor comes into a farm and asks you, what kind<br />
<strong>0:25:47-0:26:01:</strong>  of person are you? How do you like to work? Are you a loner? Poplars. Do you love having  people around and do you want to have many more young people on your farm? Permaculture.  Right. I'm caricaturing, but that's the kind of conversation that you need to have to help<br />
<strong>0:26:01-0:26:18:</strong>  farmers develop a farm holistically that meets their purpose, not just paying down debt,  because that's what most farmers are worried about now. They have bought the bullshit coming  from industry. They are in debt up to here. Bigger tractors, bigger this, bigger that,<br />
<strong>0:26:18-0:26:31:</strong>  more land, more, more, more, more. And at the same time, less and less and less and  less money coming in for the commodities that they produce. And yes, there will be a boost  because of the war this year. Commodity prices are going through the roof, but we can't expect<br />
<strong>0:26:31-0:26:49:</strong>  that to last. So on average, most farmers have been getting poorer and poorer and more  and more into debt. And so of course, that eats at you. The anxiety kills you. And it  really does. Farmers are in Europe, the job description at the highest risk of suicide.<br />
<strong>0:26:49-0:27:04:</strong>  And that is absolutely disgusting. It's us, it's society that's responsible for that,  because we don't respect our farmers, we don't pay enough for the food they produce, and  we squeeze the shit out of them just to get more and more cheap crap to fill our supermarkets.<br />
<strong>0:27:04-0:27:18:</strong>  So we need to change that too. That means we the consumers need to get better at recognizing  the difference between crap and good food. We need to work with a farmer so that the  good food becomes available to all social classes, not just to the highly educated rich<br />
<strong>0:27:18-0:27:36:</strong>  people. We need to work with a policymaker so that they encourage the good farmers to  work together with other farmers to help everybody move along in the right direction. That's  you, you know, if I'm being utopian, that's what we need. We need a holy trinity of farmers,<br />
<strong>0:27:36-0:27:51:</strong>  consumers and governments all pushing in the same direction.  We we've looked a lot at the European context. And this is our focus, rather than the African  continent. But to get an idea of what that looks like in Africa today, where are you<br />
<strong>0:27:51-0:28:07:</strong>  at then is the story through? What is the agroforestry landscape look like?  More and more what's happening in Africa, first of all, is that there is a lot more  agroforestry than there is in Europe, simply because African agriculture has been undercapitalized<br />
<strong>0:28:07-0:28:24:</strong>  in colonial times and ever since, which means that most farmers don't have access to the  kind of capital that would allow them to mechanize and use a lot of inputs, which means that  the farmers have to depend on other ways of farming. In since independence in many African<br />
<strong>0:28:24-0:28:40:</strong>  countries, the ideal has been the intensive agriculture ideal. So the agricultural advisors  that were taught in African universities were taught the same thing as they were taught  in European universities, we need a clean field, get rid of all these weeds, get rid<br />
<strong>0:28:40-0:28:56:</strong>  of all these shrubs and all these trees get a nice clean field use a tractor irrigates,  blah, blah, blah, blah. Thankfully, Africa is poor. So there are not many agricultural  advisors and there are even fewer farmers who can afford to follow that kind of advice.<br />
<strong>0:28:56-0:29:10:</strong>  So that never happens. But that means that most African farmers did not get the advice  they actually need, which is the advice on agroecology and how to manage their landscapes  in a more effective way. That has begun to change. I don't know the history well enough<br />
<strong>0:29:10-0:29:28:</strong>  to tell you where that started 20 years ago, 10 years ago, 30 years ago, but it has begun  to change. And it's beginning to change at the level of governments. One big push in  that direction has been the Paris Agreement on climate change. The Paris Agreement asks<br />
<strong>0:29:28-0:29:45:</strong>  every signatory country to declare what they call their nationally determined contribution,  what you're going to do at the level of your country to reduce emissions moving forward  or to absorb carbon moving forward. So the nationally determined contributions of a place<br />
<strong>0:29:45-0:29:57:</strong>  like Germany, we're going to build lots of windmills and solar panels. We're also shutting  down our nuclear power plants, but don't look at that, please. And the nationally determined  contribution for a place like Niger is going to be we're going to be restoring a lot of<br />
<strong>0:29:57-0:30:12:</strong>  landscapes. Niger does not have a lot of fossil fuel emissions, it does have a lot of degraded  land. So if it restores a lot of landscapes, a lot of that carbon that's in the atmosphere  is going to get back into Nigeria soils. And these nationally determined contributions,<br />
<strong>0:30:12-0:30:30:</strong>  some international commitments like the Africa 100 initiative 100 million restored hectares  of land, or the Great Green Wall of the Sahara and the Sahel, a band of trees going from  Senegal in the west to Djibouti in the east to separate the Sahel from the Sahara. All<br />
<strong>0:30:30-0:30:50:</strong>  of these initiatives are being subscribed to by local governments and are being used  to promote agroforestry. How does that promotion happen in practice? Well, there's not a lot  of money, it's development funding. And development funding is fickle. A project typically three<br />
<strong>0:30:50-0:31:06:</strong>  to five years, never more. And trees take a long time to grow even in the tropics. So  it's hard to institutionalize what is required for agroforestry in the tropics. You do have  a lot of projects that are encouraging farmers to plant trees, and most of those trees die.<br />
<strong>0:31:06-0:31:20:</strong>  Most of those trees die because having planting a tree is like having a baby. It's not when  the job stops. It's when the job starts, especially that young sapling is going to be fragile,  you're going to need to protect it, you're going to be from animals from drought. And<br />
<strong>0:31:20-0:31:34:</strong>  that demands labor, which Africans, farmers often don't expand. So what you typically  find is that there's a lot of trees around the villages, those are fruit trees, but in  the fields, there are very, very few trees because the animals are eating the saplings.<br />
<strong>0:31:34-0:31:48:</strong>  So what we need to do instead is to encourage people to work with things that demand less  capital and less labor, forms of agroforestry that demand less capital and less labor, and  that's regenerate regeneration, farmer managed natural regeneration. In across the landscapes<br />
<strong>0:31:48-0:32:03:</strong>  of Africa, you will have stumps of trees that were cut down and you have seeds in the ground,  encourage these trees to regenerate by pruning away the weak shoots and keeping the stronger  shoots, you can rapidly get forests back, because a regenerated tree grows much more<br />
<strong>0:32:03-0:32:21:</strong>  quickly than a freshly planted sapling because there's a big root mass that's feeding just  one little, one little shoot, as opposed to one little root feeding one little shoot.  So you have faster growth. By definition, you have trees that are adapted to that landscape<br />
<strong>0:32:21-0:32:36:</strong>  that are coming back, rather than trees that may come from a long way away selected by  somebody who doesn't understand the local climate and that will struggle. So these techniques  work. And in places where these techniques have been applied at scale, like Niger, they<br />
<strong>0:32:36-0:32:50:</strong>  have been transformative. In Niger, we estimate that there's now about 15 million hectares  of restored land with these regenerated trees, mostly a form of acacia called phytherbia  albeda, which is useful, because it's got a reverse phenology, it goes into dormancy<br />
<strong>0:32:50-0:33:05:</strong>  in the rainy season, so it doesn't compete with the crops. And these 15 million hectares  are generating millions of tons of more cereals per year than before, literally, because in  that landscape, it's difficult to farm without the protection of trees, the rainy season<br />
<strong>0:33:05-0:33:21:</strong>  is there. And you can get enough rain, you can get 600 or 800 millimeters, but you only  get it for two months. And after that for 10 months, it's dry. And if you don't have  the trees to buffer that and to keep the water on the ground, rather than having it run off,<br />
<strong>0:33:21-0:33:36:</strong>  and to provide a little microclimate through shade, your crops are going to struggle to  come to maturity. So in those environments, agroforestry is beginning to work better and  better. Another place where agroforestry is spreading with slowly is in the humid tropics,<br />
<strong>0:33:36-0:33:50:</strong>  coffee, cocoa, rubber, that sort of thing, where consumers in the rich world are willing  to pay a premium for agroforestry versions of those commodities, it's still very small  but it's growing.<br />
<strong>0:33:50-0:34:05:</strong>  Would the biggest tool then be access to funding then in this African context? Because is the  knowledge out there or what what tools do we have to try and make this work?  The knowledge is by and large out there with a proviso that you don't have enough advisors,<br />
<strong>0:34:05-0:34:26:</strong>  you need to train them. Funding Yes, absolutely. But not funding for yet another agroforestry  project, funding to institutionalize it, funding so that Mali or Senegal or Ethiopia or Zambia  can train and support and give careers to agroforestry and agroecology advisors for<br />
<strong>0:34:26-0:34:42:</strong>  the duration. That means funding that comes year after year after year for 102030 years,  funding that is insulated from the vagaries of politics, funding that is insulated from  the vagaries of the market, funding that is there to ensure that farmers have access to<br />
<strong>0:34:42-0:35:05:</strong>  the management advice that they need. And that funding needs to be institutionalized.  This has been done before. And the success can be seen across East Asia. You can compare  eight countries in East Asia. In the first group, you have Taiwan, South Korea, Japan,<br />
<strong>0:35:05-0:35:32:</strong>  and China. In the second group, you have the Philippines, Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia.  Let me focus on Taiwan and on the Philippines. In 1960, Taiwan was poorer than Ghana, its  income per head was lower than that of Ghana. What did the Taiwanese government do? It provided<br />
<strong>0:35:32-0:35:49:</strong>  free education only to one category of university students, agronomists, and only on condition  that these agronomists would then agree to go and live for a minimum of four years in  a village and become the agricultural advisor of those villages. What kind of education<br />
<strong>0:35:49-0:36:06:</strong>  did these agronomists get? Taiwan was poor, couldn't afford tractors and fertilizers and  pesticides. They got advice in traditional agroecological agricultural production methods.  That's what they learned. And that's what they told the farmers. At the same time, Taiwan<br />
<strong>0:36:06-0:36:28:</strong>  had a land reform. It redistributed land belonging to big landowners and big families to small  holders. Suddenly you had a country of smallholders, three, four, five hectares each being advised  by highly trained agroecological advisors. Extremely rapidly, the agricultural productivity<br />
<strong>0:36:28-0:36:46:</strong>  of the island exploded, went through the roof. And it focused on two commodity crops, asparagus  and mushrooms, which were exported to the United States. And that was the first export  success of Taiwan. And what happened to the money that came back? The money that was in<br />
<strong>0:36:46-0:37:04:</strong>  the farmers pockets. It was placed in rural credit institutions, banks. The interest paid  on that were low. So the amount of capital that was accumulating in these banks was high.  Who could get access to that capital? Companies that exported. How could you prove that you<br />
<strong>0:37:04-0:37:21:</strong>  export? Not with the tax, not with a form from your own country's tax office from the  Taiwanese tax office, because you can corrupt some guy to sign that. But with a form coming  from the government of the country to which you're exporting. If you have that, and you<br />
<strong>0:37:21-0:37:33:</strong>  can prove that you're exporting, you have access to low credit. Why did they do that?  Because that means that companies were encouraged to export, and they were encouraged to try  their hand against other products everywhere else. You also have protectionism. Other companies<br />
<strong>0:37:33-0:37:47:</strong>  could not come into Taiwan at the time. The result of that was an extraordinarily rapid  development. Today, when you look out your window, you see Taiwanese-made cars everywhere.  They are amongst the world's highest quality cars. The very first cars that were exported<br />
<strong>0:37:47-0:38:04:</strong>  from Taiwan using this model was to Saudi Arabia in 1970 or 1971. There were 1000 of  them. Two years later, less than 200 were still on the road. The quality was so shit.  But that's how you learn. That's how you learn. That's how they got credits. That's how Hyundai,<br />
<strong>0:38:04-0:38:23:</strong>  that company, learned how to make better and better and better cars. And it's now a world  beater. And that's why today Taiwan is now a country that produces 80% of the world's  microchips. That's computer, that phone, your car, your washing machine, whatever you have<br />
<strong>0:38:23-0:38:41:</strong>  that has a microchip in it. It's got an 80% chance of having come out of Taiwan. Now look  at the Philippines. The Philippines in 1960 was richer than Taiwan. The Philippines today  is the poorest of the lot. What did the Philippines do? It had very large land holding, very large<br />
<strong>0:38:41-0:39:01:</strong>  land holdings belonging to a few rich families. The productivity is abysmal. Big landowners  doing sugar cane or what have you. Lots of inputs, lots of machinery, very low productivity.  And a lot of landless peasants. These landless peasants, if they're lucky, get a job spraying<br />
<strong>0:39:01-0:39:16:</strong>  toxic chemicals and get sick in the process. If they're unlucky, they sit by the side of  the road, hocking some goods, hoping not to start. Not surprisingly, they're not happy.  Not surprising that he's doing stability and security. And in the 1970s, the farmers revolted<br />
<strong>0:39:16-0:39:32:</strong>  with Mao's little red book in their hand. Today they're revolting with the Prophet Muhammad's  little green book in their hand. It's the same thing. Landless peasants lead to instability.  And the Philippines is still now the poorest of the eight countries in that region.<br />
<strong>0:39:32-0:39:45:</strong>  Agroecology has been shown to work. After the example of Taiwan, South Korea, Japan  and China did all the same thing. When China started reforming in the late 70s, the first  thing that they did was to give farmers the right to own the produce of their land and<br />
<strong>0:39:45-0:40:01:</strong>  to manage their own land. And every farmer only had a few hectares. Boom! Agricultural  productivity exploded. So this can work. This has worked before. And what I very much hope  is that African governments recognize what worked in East Asia and why it worked and<br />
<strong>0:40:01-0:40:25:</strong>  try to do the same thing back home. So far, we are not yet getting there. That story is  not well known enough. And people are not yet understanding the crucial role that land  reform and agroecology played in getting these four successful countries to go from the state<br />
<strong>0:40:25-0:40:40:</strong>  of rural poverty to the state of advanced industrial wealth.  But now that these countries like Taiwan, if you looked at its agriculture today, has  it been industrialized, its agriculture, as it grew more wealthy and moved away from agroecology?<br />
<strong>0:40:40-0:41:00:</strong>  This followed the model, the European model, in the sense that you have more and more subsidies  for people to produce rice, basically. But it doesn't matter anymore. I mean, Taiwan  is a rich industrial country. It imports most of its food. The farming is basically people<br />
<strong>0:41:00-0:41:16:</strong>  are being paid to maintain the landscape and to produce a bit of rice. The farming is not  relevant anymore. So it's in that sense, it's a bit like Europe. You have a farming community  comprised mostly of old people, because the young have gone to the cities to work in the<br />
<strong>0:41:16-0:41:30:</strong>  factories. And these old people are getting subsidized to stay on the land.  But OK, so then if we take back the conversations, these industrialized countries and we assume  that it's not good enough, you know, to just produce rice or just produce wheat or whatever,<br />
<strong>0:41:30-0:41:45:</strong>  and we go back to the idea that we need agroforestry, we need to change management even in these  industrialized countries. How do you see the funding going forward then? Because you mentioned  that in Africa, rather than funding individual projects, we should be funding institutionalized<br />
<strong>0:41:45-0:41:59:</strong>  bodies. Of course, the context is vastly different in Europe. But my question is, you know, where  do you see where should the funding go? Is it only farmers?  The context is not that different. Farmers in Africa and in Europe want the same thing.<br />
<strong>0:41:59-0:42:16:</strong>  They want some resilience, they want some stability and they want a higher income. Farmers  in Africa and in Europe are being overwhelmed with the same pro-intensive agricultural messages.  By this, by that, you'll become a better farmer. Farmers in Africa and in Europe both lack<br />
<strong>0:42:16-0:42:31:</strong>  quality advice. Farmers in Africa and Europe, neither farmers in Africa nor farmers in Europe  have access to good pro agroforestry, pro agroecology, pro regenerative agriculture  institutions. So the context is very similar. The amount of wealth we have in Europe is<br />
<strong>0:42:31-0:42:47:</strong>  of course much, much higher. And what I would do with that wealth is again institutionalize  it. If we cannot convince member states to do so, and to my knowledge, France is the  only country in Europe that actually did try to do that under a former agricultural ministry<br />
<strong>0:42:47-0:43:03:</strong>  named Stéphane Lefort. It launched a 4 per 1000 initiative to put carbon in the soil.  It put money on the table to train agroecology and agroforestry advisors to ensure that agroforestry  was part of the curriculum in agricultural colleges. I don't know how far that has gone<br />
<strong>0:43:03-0:43:15:</strong>  and if that is continuing, but at least it moved in the right direction. But it's the  only state in the earth to have done that. And that's what's needed everywhere. So we  can only do, we need to do two things at the same time. First, we need to become much,<br />
<strong>0:43:15-0:43:33:</strong>  much better at telling this story to our national governments that this is an essential tool  in the agricultural toolbox. And the second thing that we need to do is to get much, much  better at explaining to foundations or funding bodies or rich individuals that they need<br />
<strong>0:43:33-0:43:57:</strong>  to fund the institutionalization of agroforestry and agroecology advice. Another thing that  we need to do is to stop dividing ourselves into lots of little boxes. Agroecology, agroforestry,  philanthropic agriculture, silver arable, silver plastral, holistic raising, farming God's<br />
<strong>0:43:57-0:44:13:</strong>  way, organic, there's dozens upon dozens upon dozens of labels that all mean the same thing.  Mix things up, include trees and think before you spray. That's what they all mean, right?  But they are all these different words because this one is a little bit different from that<br />
<strong>0:44:13-0:44:29:</strong>  one. And this one, we use the trees in this way and this one, fuck it. Why the hell do  we need to have that complexity? Industrial agriculture, petrochemical agriculture has  understood that. That's why they talk about conventional agriculture. And it doesn't matter<br />
<strong>0:44:29-0:44:48:</strong>  whether you're growing wheat or oil palm or chickens or beef. It's conventional agriculture,  which means lots of machinery, lots of capital, lots of expensive inputs. They always call  it conventional no matter what it is. They even call it traditional. And that shocks<br />
<strong>0:44:48-0:45:03:</strong>  me. There is nothing traditional about petrochemical agriculture. It didn't exist 70 years ago.  It's a product of modernity. Traditional agriculture is what we do. It's what the regenerators  do. It's what the agroecologists do. It's what the agroforestries do. So what we need<br />
<strong>0:45:03-0:45:20:</strong>  to do is to get much better at the vocabulary as well. We are traditional agriculture. They  are petrochemical agriculture.  And in terms of this funding, do you see then, you mentioned foundations, you mentioned other<br />
<strong>0:45:20-0:45:36:</strong>  bodies than public bodies. And that was one of my questions. Which role do you see for  private companies, for other sources of funding? And I'm thinking at the moment, we're talking  a lot about carbon credits, for example, or payment for ecosystem services that also sometimes<br />
<strong>0:45:36-0:45:53:</strong>  can be controversial on some levels. And where do you see the future of this? Because we've  obviously seen how difficult it is to change this massive mammoth that the CAP is and European  policy is in general. So do you see it more promising to try and, I mean, bypass it, you<br />
<strong>0:45:53-0:46:04:</strong>  can't bypass it because it's the reality of farmers, but I mean, to kind of sidestep it  and try and take things forward with companies or other types of actors? Or how do you see  this strategy?<br />
<strong>0:46:04-0:46:20:</strong>  The interest in carbon is immense. There's a wall of money flooding across the landscape,  everybody's looking for high quality carbon. And people are recognising that there's only  so many pristine rainforests you can save by pumping money into them. So you need to<br />
<strong>0:46:20-0:46:35:</strong>  plant trees in other environments. So a lot of that money is going to tree plantations,  not a great idea. But a lot of it is trying to go into agroforestry, much better idea.  But that money is facing the same kind of problem that we've just described. It's happy<br />
<strong>0:46:35-0:46:54:</strong>  to reward farmers who do agroforestry, but it doesn't understand that it first has to  pay for the technical assistance to convince those farmers to try agroforestry. So these  funds very often are just looking for existing projects that they can top up. In effect,<br />
<strong>0:46:54-0:47:10:</strong>  they're parasites. They want somebody else to pay for the technical advice, somebody  else to help the farmers do the difficult job of deciding to do agroforestry. And then  they will reward the farmers. Sorry, that's not business. That's just parasitism. People<br />
<strong>0:47:10-0:47:25:</strong>  who want to do it right, carbon funders want to do it right, and they exist know that they  have to roll up their shirtsleeves, they have to go into the landscape, they have to help  the farmers adapt. And that is not going to be cheap, and it's not going to be fast, but<br />
<strong>0:47:25-0:47:39:</strong>  it is going to be very high quality carbon.  And so again, it goes back to this idea of like, going to find partners on a national  level and funding them, funding networks, funding technicians, funding the professionals<br />
<strong>0:47:39-0:47:53:</strong>  that can then bring this transition forward, rather than looking for lonely pioneers and  saying we helped plant X amount of trees. Is that what you're saying?  Absolutely. If you want to change the world, you need people to change it. It's as simple<br />
<strong>0:47:53-0:48:03:</strong>  as that. Especially when the solution is not an app or something you buy in a bag, but  something that consists of advice.  One of my questions, but I think we've answered it a bit is, you know, what's the next step<br />
<strong>0:48:03-0:48:23:</strong>  for the European agroforestry movements? You've talked about telling a story. I don't know  if there's something more to add, or on the funding aspect, if anything comes to mind.  Yeah. The story is like a key that opens the lock to a door, right? And once the door is<br />
<strong>0:48:23-0:48:39:</strong>  open, you have the room behind it. And the room behind it is the empty brain box of the  person who tried to convince them, you need to, you need to furnish that room. And you  need to add reasons to believe. And that's when the data comes in. That's where the experiments<br />
<strong>0:48:39-0:48:56:</strong>  comes in. That's where the testimonials from successful farmers comes in, right? Once you  do that, once you have that, then you have an ally. And then you have to understand how  to use that ally. Can an ally help you change policy? Or can an ally help you get the right<br />
<strong>0:48:56-0:49:12:</strong>  funding stream in place? Or if you're lucky, as in France with Stéphane Lefort, can an  ally actually begin to change the way the whole agricultural education and advice machinery  of a major member state operates, right? But Stéphane Lefort was also convinced by a story<br />
<strong>0:49:12-0:49:25:</strong>  originally, and then he educated himself. He's a clever man. And he found that this  was more than just a story. And that's how you have to work. So what is the future for  European Agroforestry? First European Agroforestry is becoming professionalized. We were founded<br />
<strong>0:49:25-0:49:39:</strong>  over 10 years ago, the ERF. And so far, it's been exclusively run by volunteers. There's  a board, there's an executive committee, each and every one of us is doing it on top of  our day job. We are hiring a Secretary General with a bit of luck that Secretary General<br />
<strong>0:49:39-0:49:54:</strong>  will be in place from August or September onwards with an office in Brussels. We'll  be hiring, hopefully a full time lobbyist to support the Secretary General. And so we  will have a voice that's going to be stronger simply because it is going to be a little<br />
<strong>0:49:54-0:50:14:</strong>  bit institutionalized and professionalized. The more difficult thing, but the more important  thing in my view will be for the next board of the European Agroforestry Federation to  focus on how we can help individual national federations become better national lobbyists.<br />
<strong>0:50:14-0:50:30:</strong>  We need the Hungarians and the Romanians and the Swedes and the Irish and the Spanish and  what have you to become better at lobbying their own ministries of agriculture and their  own national governments to ensure that agroecological options like agroforestry are integrated into<br />
<strong>0:50:30-0:50:50:</strong>  the agricultural development plans. And we need to do it now. We have a tendency of putting  enormous hopes and new Common Agricultural Policy proposals and then when they come out  and the inevitable disappointment comes in, we have a tendency of laying down our weapons<br />
<strong>0:50:50-0:51:02:</strong>  and saying, oh, well, at least we tried. Let's wait for the next one in five years time and  let's do it again. Well, we've been doing that for 15 years. It's not done a lot of  change. We need to get better at lobbying on an ongoing basis. And with the strategic<br />
<strong>0:51:02-0:51:18:</strong>  plans, we actually have that possibility, right? Yes, the strategic plans are bloody  awful, but they can be adapted year after year after year. And if we create a coalition  of farmers that want it, of academics and activists that say, guys, this is a no brainer,<br />
<strong>0:51:18-0:51:30:</strong>  you've got to do agroforestry, it's got to be part of the toolkit, then maybe we can  shift the needle a little bit in the member states. And that's going to become, but that's  more complicated. It doesn't happen in English, or even in French, it happens in Slovene or<br />
<strong>0:51:30-0:51:48:</strong>  Croat or Romansh or Finnish. It happens in cultures that we don't necessarily know, it  happens in languages that we don't know. And it has to be done 27 different times, not  just once. So it's a lot more expensive and a lot more complicated. And figuring out how<br />
<strong>0:51:48-0:52:03:</strong>  to make that happen, figuring out how to get that funded is going to be crucial in the  future of European agroforestry.  And today you have because what's what I find interesting is that Dimitri and I started<br />
<strong>0:52:03-0:52:16:</strong>  the podcast from the totally different perspective, what you're saying is that we heard the story,  and then faced with the difficulties, we're like, okay, well, let's try and actually figure  this out on the ground. And we often talk about, you know, we often start from the assumption,<br />
<strong>0:52:16-0:52:32:</strong>  okay, we know the big picture, we know how amazing it is. But we are always faced with  those technical difficulties. But today, when you when you talk about agroforestry, you  have all the successful examples, you need them to, to illustrate that today, the limiting<br />
<strong>0:52:32-0:52:48:</strong>  factor is getting that story outside. It's not the technical kind of level.  That's true to a large extent with one proviso, it's remarkably difficult to get good data  on the economic benefits of agroforestry. And the reason for that is that so much of<br />
<strong>0:52:48-0:53:02:</strong>  the economic benefits depend on the total income, including the timber of the trees  at the end of their rotation. And even short rotation to trees like poplars, it's 15-18  years before you start seeing any income. So and no research project lasts as long.<br />
<strong>0:53:02-0:53:19:</strong>  So there's remarkably little research that is simply toted up the expenses and the outgoings  for an agroforestry system from beginning to end. And that's difficult because farmers  are interested in income. And we cannot give them here, here's a farm that's been doing<br />
<strong>0:53:19-0:53:34:</strong>  it for 50 years, here's an incoming outgoings, here's how the debt has gone down. And here's  how the profits have gone up. We have remarkable difficulty doing that. The only place where  we can do that is in places that have traditional agroforestry systems, like the Dehezas or<br />
<strong>0:53:34-0:53:53:</strong>  the Montados in Iberia, which are silver pastoral systems with a variety of livestock grazing  on the oaks, including the iconic cork oak. Those systems have been in operation for a  very long time. The farmers who are using those systems have climbed up the food chain<br />
<strong>0:53:53-0:54:15:</strong>  to provide extremely valuable, extremely highly rewarded meats to the top end, the luxury  market. Think of Pata Negra Am, for example, or in Hungary, Mangalitsa pork. And in these  environments you can study the incomes and the outgoings and it works. And sometimes<br />
<strong>0:54:15-0:54:33:</strong>  you have, it's anecdotal, but sometimes you have examples like this place I know of in  Portugal, an aristocratic family that got its land back after the socialists lost power.  Two brothers, 450 hectares each. One followed the advice of the agronomists, got rid of<br />
<strong>0:54:33-0:54:49:</strong>  all these trees, put a wheat plantation in place, worked well for a couple of decades.  Now not so much. The other one, gregarious, liked people, kept his Montado system and  invited young people to come and try different kinds of farming, horticulture and olives<br />
<strong>0:54:49-0:55:03:</strong>  and chickens and what have you on there, saying that they didn't have to pay any rent for  the first five years and after that they would split the profits. The first brother is now  living alone on his farm. You don't need many people to manage 450 hectares of wheat. You<br />
<strong>0:55:03-0:55:19:</strong>  can do it with machinery. He's depressed. His wife has left him. The other farmer, he's  got 20, 25 families living on his land. It's surrounded by children and kids and families.  The landscape is thriving. There's water, there's animals, there's wildlife. There's<br />
<strong>0:55:19-0:55:33:</strong>  a lot of pigs, a lot of cattle and a lot of sheep and a lot of happy people. I mean it's  obvious which system is better, right? It's just obvious but it's rare that you see this  side by side comparison like that.<br />
<strong>0:55:33-0:55:51:</strong>  And especially what we found difficult is, you know, when you talk to scientists often  their science, scientific studies are on a very specific topic at a very specific time  frame. So it's very hard to get them to extrapolate or make bigger statements or tendencies because<br />
<strong>0:55:51-0:56:06:</strong>  that's a bit against their scientific minds, you know. So we've been trying to get those  scientists on the show and also trying to talk to farmers. And it is interesting because  we've talked to dozens of people and we have had very interesting conversations but it<br />
<strong>0:56:06-0:56:23:</strong>  is difficult to sit a farmer down and tell him like what exactly have you observed or  can you really put a number on it, can you really quantify it. That's very difficult.  And I was just wondering if that was a challenge in terms of actually then pushing that story<br />
<strong>0:56:23-0:56:40:</strong>  forward on the policy level or if at the end of the day you already have all the data you  need because you have a bigger maybe sample of studies you can rest yourself upon.  As I said on the financial side we simply don't have enough data, right? We need more<br />
<strong>0:56:40-0:56:54:</strong>  data. On the biophysics, the social side we do have enough data but on the finance side  we don't have enough data. We have good anecdotes but the plural of anecdote is not data. To  get back to this idea that scientists don't want to be drawn, they are scientists. Their<br />
<strong>0:56:54-0:57:13:</strong>  job is not to lobby for A or B. Their job is to find out how A or B works and at most  to compare them and to do the papers. They are the wrong person to ask for these big  sweeping statements. That's why World Agroforestry, a scientific research organization hired somebody<br />
<strong>0:57:13-0:57:27:</strong>  like me. I am not a practicing scientist. I am a storyteller. That's what I do. And  they figured they needed somebody like me on top of all of the science to explain the  science better, to help the science get into the right policy circles, to help the science<br />
<strong>0:57:27-0:57:42:</strong>  get into the right donor circles. So we need both. We need both. We need an alliance of  these different skill sets. We need clever farmers who are doing it well and who can  show their farms to others. We need the scientists who can measure how well these systems work<br />
<strong>0:57:42-0:57:55:</strong>  and how badly the other systems work. We need the storytellers who can package all that  and put it out there and help people understand how important it is. And you Etienne with  your podcast, you are a classical storyteller. I mean you are actually getting lots of people<br />
<strong>0:57:55-0:58:12:</strong>  to tell those stories and as I understand it you have more and more listeners on your  podcast. So it's great. We need more like you. We need more people to tell the story  of regeneration. Finally, and that's utopian again, we need a little bit of education at<br />
<strong>0:58:12-0:58:28:</strong>  the level of the schools. Kids have no idea where their food comes from. They don't know  what nature is. I'm sure we've all had that experience. Our city-based friends say, oh,  I had a great weekend. I went walking in the countryside. It was wonderful to be in pure<br />
<strong>0:58:28-0:58:44:</strong>  nature and you ask them where they went and when you then look at them at they were in  an intensively farmed agricultural areas just after this break loads of pesticides. Not  so natural. So people don't understand the difference between a high functioning ecosystem<br />
<strong>0:58:44-0:59:04:</strong>  and a non-functioning ecosystem. And I think that this love of complexity, this biofilia,  this love of farming systems that combine things is something that kids have from very  small onwards. Three, four, five year olds when they picture a farm, they picture an<br />
<strong>0:59:04-0:59:21:</strong>  apple tree and a cow and a goat and a pig and a happy farm. They picture what is in  effect a smallholder farm. And when they grow up they forget that because nobody has encouraged  them to think that this is important and they think it's perfectly normal to have these<br />
<strong>0:59:21-0:59:36:</strong>  giant farms of 5,000 hectares that are producing one commodity only while destroying the land.  So we need to encourage that love of complexity as kids grow up. We need to encourage them  to be able to recognize when they walk in the countryside, this is a well-managed farm.<br />
<strong>0:59:36-0:59:53:</strong>  This is a badly managed farm. This is good land. This is bad land. And that's something  that disappears as people move to cities. But it's utopian to expect the educational  systems of all of Europe to start taking these issues on board sensibly and consequently.<br />
