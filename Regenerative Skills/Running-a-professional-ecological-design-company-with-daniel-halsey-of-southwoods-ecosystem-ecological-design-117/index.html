<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:18">0:02:18-0:02:21</a>:</strong>  Alright, welcome everybody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:21">0:02:21-0:02:25</a>:</strong>  One of the most common concerns that I hear from the regenerative community is how someone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:25">0:02:25-0:02:30</a>:</strong>  can make a good living while working directly on projects that regenerate our planet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:30">0:02:30-0:02:33</a>:</strong>  While there are many different ways to do this, it seems that the dominant narrative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:33">0:02:33-0:02:38</a>:</strong>  in business tells us that the most profitable job prospects are those that are destroying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:38">0:02:38-0:02:40</a>:</strong>  our natural world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:40">0:02:40-0:02:44</a>:</strong>  Exploitative petroleum companies post record profits while unethical banking practices<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:44">0:02:44-0:02:49</a>:</strong>  pay out massive bonuses and manufacturing covers our landscapes in trash.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:49">0:02:49-0:02:53</a>:</strong>  But I know a growing number of people who are pioneering new options for ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:53">0:02:53-0:02:56</a>:</strong>  work and making a good wage in the process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:56">0:02:56-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  Now though this is rarely ever the primary motivation to do what they're passionate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:04</a>:</strong>  about, it's important to know that you don't have to compromise a life of holistic abundance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:04">0:03:04-0:03:07</a>:</strong>  to dedicate your time to regenerative work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:07">0:03:07-0:03:10</a>:</strong>  And that's why I'll be focusing in the upcoming weeks on profitable businesses that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:10">0:03:10-0:03:12</a>:</strong>  are doing just that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:12">0:03:12-0:03:16</a>:</strong>  Specifically, I'll be speaking to leaders who are offering solutions to conscious and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:16">0:03:16-0:03:20</a>:</strong>  ecological businesses that help them break through their financial constraints and into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:20">0:03:20-0:03:24</a>:</strong>  profitability in more than just a monetary way.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:54">0:03:54-0:03:58</a>:</strong>  and all over North America from Alaska to the Southern mainland, Dan's perspective<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:03:58">0:03:58-0:04:03</a>:</strong>  on patterns and local cultural consideration is truly impressive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:03">0:04:03-0:04:07</a>:</strong>  Now in this interview, we discussed the implications of the destruction that humans are having<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  on the planet which stretch far beyond carbon emissions and climate change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:12">0:04:12-0:04:16</a>:</strong>  Dan also talks about some of the details and observations from his many projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:16">0:04:16-0:04:20</a>:</strong>  We then switch to focus on the business aspect of running an ecological design and consultation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:20">0:04:20-0:04:21</a>:</strong>  firm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:21">0:04:21-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  Dan and I go over the importance of asking the right questions and how important it is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:31</a>:</strong>  to have a design criteria list for gathering information and recording observations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:31">0:04:31-0:04:35</a>:</strong>  We also go over everything from attracting clients, the advantages and challenges of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:35">0:04:35-0:04:40</a>:</strong>  collaboration, profiles of the organizations that he's helped to start, and much more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:40">0:04:40-0:04:44</a>:</strong>  Now there's one section of the interview where Dan shares his screen to show me parts of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:44">0:04:44-0:04:50</a>:</strong>  the functionality of the Natural Capital Plant database that's hard to understand over audio.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:50">0:04:50-0:04:54</a>:</strong>  But I've uploaded the video to the show notes for this episode at AbundantEdge.com so you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:54">0:04:54-0:04:56</a>:</strong>  can watch and follow along.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:04:56">0:04:56-0:05:00</a>:</strong>  So definitely grab your notebooks for this one and I'll turn things over to Daniel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:00">0:05:00-0:05:03</a>:</strong>  Hey Daniel, thank you so much for joining me today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  It's such a pleasure to finally connect with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:07</a>:</strong>  I've been a fan of your work for a long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:07">0:05:07-0:05:08</a>:</strong>  Well, thank you very much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:08">0:05:08-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  I'm really happy to be here and talk to you about the design process and all the things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:15</a>:</strong>  going on in permaculture and ecological design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:15">0:05:15-0:05:16</a>:</strong>  Excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:16">0:05:16-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  Well, yeah, I've got tons of questions that I'd love to ask you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:19">0:05:19-0:05:21</a>:</strong>  So what do you say we just jump right in?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:21">0:05:21-0:05:22</a>:</strong>  Sounds great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:22">0:05:22-0:05:25</a>:</strong>  All right, so Daniel, could you first tell our listeners a little bit about your personal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:25">0:05:25-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  background and how you got inspired to start to work in ecological design?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:31">0:05:31-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:38</a>:</strong>  Well actually, like with most things, I tell people it's kind of following the energy and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:38">0:05:38-0:05:42</a>:</strong>  following opportunity in life where things go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:42">0:05:42-0:05:48</a>:</strong>  And my permaculture story, ecological design, like I do now started long time ago, but not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:48">0:05:48-0:05:49</a>:</strong>  actually in permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:49">0:05:49-0:05:52</a>:</strong>  I didn't even know about it at the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:52">0:05:52-0:05:58</a>:</strong>  So for 25 years, I was a food photographer and package designer doing graphic design,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:05:58">0:05:58-0:06:02</a>:</strong>  a lot of food photography, large format back in the analog days, lots of film, then did<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:02">0:06:02-0:06:07</a>:</strong>  digital and that was going quite well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:07">0:06:07-0:06:13</a>:</strong>  What got me into permaculture was during that time I got sepsis, which is toxic shock.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:13">0:06:13-0:06:14</a>:</strong>  Don't know where it came from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:14">0:06:14-0:06:18</a>:</strong>  It's kind of a blood infection, really bad news.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:18">0:06:18-0:06:19</a>:</strong>  I didn't know it at the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:19">0:06:19-0:06:23</a>:</strong>  I learned a lot about it afterwards because you don't have a lot of time to study something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:23">0:06:23-0:06:25</a>:</strong>  when you're in the middle of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:25">0:06:25-0:06:28</a>:</strong>  So I went in the hospital, lost about 25 pounds in eight days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:28">0:06:28-0:06:31</a>:</strong>  I was about 35, really good shape though.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:31">0:06:31-0:06:32</a>:</strong>  I was a downhill ski coach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:32">0:06:32-0:06:35</a>:</strong>  I was like really good shape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:35">0:06:35-0:06:40</a>:</strong>  Eat that, fortunately, but then had to learn what food was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:40">0:06:40-0:06:47</a>:</strong>  I was referred to Dr. Kevin Wand, who's a osteopath, homeopath, doctor locally at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:47">0:06:47-0:06:48</a>:</strong>  time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:48">0:06:48-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  The nurse said, you need to talk to this guy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:52</a>:</strong>  He knows what will fix you up and what you need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:52">0:06:52-0:06:55</a>:</strong>  I met with him and I learned what food actually was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:06:55">0:06:55-0:07:00</a>:</strong>  He said because they give you like Cipro, Ciproflax and all these things to kill off<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:00">0:07:00-0:07:03</a>:</strong>  these bugs, but they also kill off all the good bugs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:03">0:07:03-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  So his idea was, you know, if you're just starting out, we got to get your digestive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:10</a>:</strong>  system back, get things going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:10">0:07:10-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  You first need to learn what food is and you need to start eating better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:19</a>:</strong>  Cause I was just eating the general popular culture, typical stuff at the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:19">0:07:19-0:07:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:20">0:07:20-0:07:21</a>:</strong>  Like so many of us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:21">0:07:21-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:26</a>:</strong>  And of course I found out what food costs when you start buying good food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:26">0:07:26-0:07:27</a>:</strong>  That was a big deal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:27">0:07:27-0:07:28</a>:</strong>  Also.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:28">0:07:28-0:07:29</a>:</strong>  It's like, wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:29">0:07:29-0:07:32</a>:</strong>  Go to the natural food store, start buying wholesome foods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:32">0:07:32-0:07:35</a>:</strong>  And on one hand it's expensive on the other hand, you eat so much less of it because you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:35">0:07:35-0:07:37</a>:</strong>  don't have to eat so much of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:37">0:07:37-0:07:40</a>:</strong>  Um, you're what I found fuller faster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:40">0:07:40-0:07:45</a>:</strong>  So I started eating better and then I started growing my own food and tomatoes, peppers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:45">0:07:45-0:07:46</a>:</strong>  things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:46">0:07:46-0:07:47</a>:</strong>  Things that are easy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:47">0:07:47-0:07:51</a>:</strong>  I was living in a suburbia and then I met a permaculture person, uh, uh, Paula West<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:51">0:07:51-0:07:54</a>:</strong>  Morland at the green expo in St Paul.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:54">0:07:54-0:07:56</a>:</strong>  This is about 2003.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:56">0:07:56-0:07:59</a>:</strong>  And what's amazing is I had seen permaculture magazine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:07:59">0:07:59-0:08:03</a>:</strong>  I was reading permaculture magazine and then all of a sudden I ran into one other person<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:03">0:08:03-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  who knew what permaculture was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:10</a>:</strong>  Within a couple of years we had critical mass of about 80 people in PRI cold climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:10">0:08:10-0:08:12</a>:</strong>  That's where I learned what permaculture was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:12">0:08:12-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  Got my PDC, very much got into it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:17</a>:</strong>  Um, it was excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:17">0:08:17-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  About that time I had an opportunity to buy a little farm, rural hobby farm about 15 miles<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:23</a>:</strong>  away where I'm sitting right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:23">0:08:23-0:08:28</a>:</strong>  And I had an excellent opportunity then to exercise all these things I was learning in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:31</a>:</strong>  permaculture, but I still have my photo studio here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:31">0:08:31-0:08:35</a>:</strong>  And then in 2006, uh, they were looking for a place for a food forest project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:35">0:08:35-0:08:41</a>:</strong>  I volunteered and we also had the luck of having Jeff Lawton come for two weeks, uh,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:41">0:08:41-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  in the County here doing presentations in different areas and then also doing a workshop<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:47</a>:</strong>  here where we put in our food forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:47">0:08:47-0:08:52</a>:</strong>  And that was where it kind of all started, uh, in 2006.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:52">0:08:52-0:08:54</a>:</strong>  Now that was great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:54">0:08:54-0:08:55</a>:</strong>  Photography was great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:55">0:08:55-0:08:56</a>:</strong>  Everything was going well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:56">0:08:56-0:08:57</a>:</strong>  Money's coming in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:08:57">0:08:57-0:09:02</a>:</strong>  Um, but the thing that got me into ecological design was, uh, for an industry, which was,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:02">0:09:02-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  I was into marketing, which was just Bulletproof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:10</a>:</strong>  Uh, as you can imagine, package design, every time the economy changes, packages change,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:10">0:09:10-0:09:11</a>:</strong>  right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:11">0:09:11-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  Atkins in, Atkins out, you name it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:18</a>:</strong>  So we were doing pretty good until that whole subprime sort of thing happened in 2008, nine,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:18">0:09:18-0:09:22</a>:</strong>  uh, where everybody was under so much stress, corporations, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:22">0:09:22-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  My clients were laying off everybody and really the work dried up quickly and I was teaching<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:32</a>:</strong>  photography at a college to bring in some extra cash and they wanted me to get a master's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:32">0:09:32-0:09:35</a>:</strong>  degree in photography after shooting for 25 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:35">0:09:35-0:09:39</a>:</strong>  And I said, so I went to the University of Minnesota, was checking that out until I realized,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:39">0:09:39-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  you know what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:42</a>:</strong>  I think I'm going to study horticulture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:42">0:09:42-0:09:48</a>:</strong>  I think I'm going to go fulfill my permaculture interests and finish up my old bachelor's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:48">0:09:48-0:09:49</a>:</strong>  from years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:49">0:09:49-0:09:55</a>:</strong>  And then I also, uh, did my master's and my master's program was developing an ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:09:55">0:09:55-0:10:00</a>:</strong>  design system using permaculture principles and practices for what was being taught as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:00">0:10:00-0:10:02</a>:</strong>  landscape design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:02">0:10:02-0:10:06</a>:</strong>  So I took the landscape design courses, which is a lot of, you know, ornamentals and aesthetics,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:06">0:10:06-0:10:07</a>:</strong>  things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:07">0:10:07-0:10:10</a>:</strong>  And I just flipped it on its head and I put in the new priorities as permaculture would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:10">0:10:10-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  have it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:17</a>:</strong>  And that is ecological functions, plant guilds, polycultures, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:17">0:10:17-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  And that's really where the design process I'm using today came from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:24</a>:</strong>  And it's of course evolved quite a bit since then.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:24">0:10:24-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  But that was really the process of getting into this was understanding the patterns as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:32</a>:</strong>  we learned in permaculture in the beginning, kind of seeing the patterns and we'll talk<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:32">0:10:32-0:10:36</a>:</strong>  about this, I'm sure more about the patterns in climate and weather, but really understanding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:36">0:10:36-0:10:43</a>:</strong>  that I think I need to move from pop culture, pop business into this more ecological business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:45</a>:</strong>  and a more ecological lifestyle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:45">0:10:45-0:10:48</a>:</strong>  And that's what's pretty much supported me since then.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:48">0:10:48-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  You know, we're going basically on 11 years since that big shift.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:54</a>:</strong>  Travel places I never thought I'd ever go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:54">0:10:54-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  I was a big, you know, big fan of Canada being in Minnesota, you know, five, six years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:04</a>:</strong>  And since then doing ecological design, finding out, wow, this is really important and people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:04">0:11:04-0:11:09</a>:</strong>  need permaculture principles and ethics all over the world, but they also need ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:09">0:11:09-0:11:13</a>:</strong>  design that's understandable and tailored to their needs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:13">0:11:13-0:11:16</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and in a way that they can really relate to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:22</a>:</strong>  And I think it's fantastic that so many of the ways that you got inspired to pursue this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:24</a>:</strong>  can be related to by so many people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:24">0:11:24-0:11:29</a>:</strong>  Like you started first by connecting with healthier food and then finding a community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:29">0:11:29-0:11:33</a>:</strong>  that really supported this, getting connected with other people who knew more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:33">0:11:33-0:11:37</a>:</strong>  And then when you found opportunities to pursue it more professionally and integrate some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:37">0:11:37-0:11:41</a>:</strong>  of the skills that you had previously is really when it sounds like it took off for you as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:43</a>:</strong>  a career path.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:43">0:11:43-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  Right it really did because I had the background of graphic design and the aesthetics that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  are required.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:11:53</a>:</strong>  And I found of course when I was doing package design and food photography, it's about what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:53">0:11:53-0:11:56</a>:</strong>  we call the easy read.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:56">0:11:56-0:11:59</a>:</strong>  People need to look at it, know what it is, understand it quickly and it has to be simple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:11:59">0:11:59-0:12:05</a>:</strong>  And we have another term that I use a lot, which is called visual noise to reduce the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:05">0:12:05-0:12:09</a>:</strong>  things that aren't helping the communication and emphasize the things that communicate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:09">0:12:09-0:12:13</a>:</strong>  better, which sounds simple, but it's actually, you know, it is, can be simple once you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:13">0:12:13-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  the principles of doing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:15">0:12:15-0:12:21</a>:</strong>  So those principles of communicating concepts and communicating principles of a design say<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:21">0:12:21-0:12:28</a>:</strong>  really came from my package design experience and limiting myself to the color palette that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:28">0:12:28-0:12:29</a>:</strong>  does that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:29">0:12:29-0:12:34</a>:</strong>  The icons that were very big on now, like with United designers and using Adobe illustrator<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:34">0:12:34-0:12:38</a>:</strong>  to very much simplify our designs, the absolute necessity of information that needs to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:38">0:12:38-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  on it and reducing what we call the visual noise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  And that's part of my course too is explaining to people and seeing examples of how we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:51</a>:</strong>  reduce that because especially with our clients, you know, we may be staring at the same design<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:51">0:12:51-0:12:54</a>:</strong>  for hours and hours and it affects us too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:54">0:12:54-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  So after a while you don't see anything anymore because you have all this fatigue in your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:13:00</a>:</strong>  eyes and we're trying to kind of fix that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:00">0:13:00-0:13:05</a>:</strong>  So in the process of doing our design, we really reduce the opportunities for your eyes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:05">0:13:05-0:13:09</a>:</strong>  to have to shift, especially in colors, bright, different colors, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:09">0:13:09-0:13:13</a>:</strong>  So when we look at, like I'm looking at my little woodland out here, the number of greens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:13">0:13:13-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  that are out there and browns and tones are actually quite limited and makes it that much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:22</a>:</strong>  easier to look at as opposed to I was looking at the blues and oranges and you know, there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:22">0:13:22-0:13:26</a>:</strong>  are blue trees sort of, we call them that, but really in our design work, everything's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:26">0:13:26-0:13:30</a>:</strong>  a shade of green and earth tones and that really helps people communicate on their level<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:30">0:13:30-0:13:33</a>:</strong>  of what they understand and it makes it easier for them to understand what the design is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:33">0:13:33-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  all about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:40</a>:</strong>  Man, I love hearing how people of many different types of disciplines and areas of study find<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:40">0:13:40-0:13:47</a>:</strong>  a way to bring their expertise and their perspectives into these types of regenerative skills that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:50</a>:</strong>  seemingly wouldn't have a whole lot to do with one another until you find this sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:50">0:13:50-0:13:55</a>:</strong>  of creative overlap and it's to me one of the most exciting things about the growing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:55">0:13:55-0:13:59</a>:</strong>  community that's gotten behind regenerative pursuits.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:13:59">0:13:59-0:14:05</a>:</strong>  Now you mentioned before about going into some of the details about our climate situation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:05">0:14:05-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  I mean it seems fairly well understood by most people who are tuned into any sort of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  news outlets at all that you know, the rising levels of CO2 are starting to warm the planet,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:23</a>:</strong>  but when you start to get into it, there are actually much more pressing and extreme manifestations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:23">0:14:23-0:14:29</a>:</strong>  that are not directly related to rises in CO2 levels and I'm talking about things like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:29">0:14:29-0:14:37</a>:</strong>  mass extinction, loss of species and diversity, the habitats and big disruptions in the water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:37">0:14:37-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  cycle that turn into desertification.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:40">0:14:40-0:14:45</a>:</strong>  Can you tell me about some of the information that you've gathered in your study and in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:45">0:14:45-0:14:52</a>:</strong>  your practice that really drives home the urgency of some of the other effects of climate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:52">0:14:52-0:14:57</a>:</strong>  change and basically the impact that we're having on our ecology?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:57">0:14:57-0:14:58</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:14:58">0:14:58-0:15:05</a>:</strong>  Well, recently, so we went to the global repair conference that was in Port Townsend, Oregon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:05">0:15:05-0:15:10</a>:</strong>  or Washington, excuse me, was there and got a chance to talk to some of my friends, people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:10">0:15:10-0:15:13</a>:</strong>  I've known for a long time and get the details.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:13">0:15:13-0:15:18</a>:</strong>  Tom Gereau was there speaking, he's a PhD from Harvard, he had one of his books back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:18">0:15:18-0:15:20</a>:</strong>  here, the Geotherapy that I have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:20">0:15:20-0:15:25</a>:</strong>  He talks about the actual science, the real science about climate change and the responses<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:25">0:15:25-0:15:31</a>:</strong>  of the ecological systems and as we are visual and observation being one of those great things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:31">0:15:31-0:15:35</a>:</strong>  in permaculture, we're looking for patterns, we're making notes of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:35">0:15:35-0:15:39</a>:</strong>  If you've seen some of the changes in the species and how they're reacting to the changes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:39">0:15:39-0:15:45</a>:</strong>  in the ecology, that's what's kind of scary.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:45">0:15:45-0:15:50</a>:</strong>  Over thousands of years of change, species can adapt but it's changing over decades,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:50">0:15:50-0:15:53</a>:</strong>  it just doesn't happen, they can't adapt that quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:53">0:15:53-0:15:58</a>:</strong>  So one of the things I noticed, we're working on a project in Poland and here's one example<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:15:58">0:15:58-0:16:03</a>:</strong>  of how species are adapting and some can be successful that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:03">0:16:03-0:16:09</a>:</strong>  So in this Polish estuary, it's quite large, the temperature of the water has changed and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:09">0:16:09-0:16:12</a>:</strong>  things in the water have changed due to climate change and of course agriculture, things like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:12">0:16:12-0:16:13</a>:</strong>  that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:13">0:16:13-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  So a lot of the mussels that were the food for a duck, the greater scop, we call it the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:24</a>:</strong>  blue bill, goes by other names, but this duck is the deepest diving duck and it eats mussels<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:24">0:16:24-0:16:26</a>:</strong>  and mollusks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:31</a>:</strong>  And so the zebra mussel is what it was now shifting to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:31">0:16:31-0:16:36</a>:</strong>  The old food source that it had has basically died off but the invasive zebra mussel had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:36">0:16:36-0:16:41</a>:</strong>  moved in because it has the warmer weather and now this duck has actually changed its<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:41">0:16:41-0:16:46</a>:</strong>  food from what was and now has gone to a new kind of food source, which is pretty amazing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:46">0:16:46-0:16:49</a>:</strong>  and very adaptable that they've been able to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:49">0:16:49-0:16:55</a>:</strong>  One thing they found very striking too, I was lucky enough to go to Sitka, Alaska on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:55">0:16:55-0:16:58</a>:</strong>  a cruise on one of the small research ships for National Geographic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:16:58">0:16:58-0:17:03</a>:</strong>  It's kind of a combination research combination of a general cruise, what do you call it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:03">0:17:03-0:17:07</a>:</strong>  ecotourism type of thing for about eight days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:07">0:17:07-0:17:11</a>:</strong>  And some of the things we were learning on that ship, there are about 50 of us and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:11">0:17:11-0:17:14</a>:</strong>  naturalists and biologists around there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:14">0:17:14-0:17:18</a>:</strong>  Other whales, there are two types of orcas, those that eat fish and those that eat meat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:18">0:17:18-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  I did not know this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:24</a>:</strong>  And they're different and they're different packs, different pods, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:24">0:17:24-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  What has been for the first time ever, they've documented that orcas are killing blue whales<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:35</a>:</strong>  or in specifically there's one blue whale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:35">0:17:35-0:17:38</a>:</strong>  And if you understand how alligators and other animals, turtles sometimes, they'll take their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:42</a>:</strong>  prey and they'll bury it in the bottom of the ocean or hold it down to go back and get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:42">0:17:42-0:17:47</a>:</strong>  it later, right, to extend their food source.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:47">0:17:47-0:17:52</a>:</strong>  Orcas were seen to kill a whale and then bring it to the bottom and bury it in the ocean<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:52">0:17:52-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  for later food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:54">0:17:54-0:17:55</a>:</strong>  That's nothing that's ever been seen before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:17:55">0:17:55-0:18:01</a>:</strong>  Is that a situation where now the animals are actually responding to scarcity?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:02</a>:</strong>  It would seem so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:02">0:18:02-0:18:06</a>:</strong>  And there are other examples of that where some animals are actually adapting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:06">0:18:06-0:18:11</a>:</strong>  And as much as we do see, of course, having been by the glaciers and icebergs, that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:11">0:18:11-0:18:16</a>:</strong>  just the tip of the iceberg as opposed to what other animals, reptiles, whatever, are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:16">0:18:16-0:18:18</a>:</strong>  adapting to this change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:18">0:18:18-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  On the other hand, the release, and I think we owe it to ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:27</a>:</strong>  And if you haven't seen it, Our Planet by David Attenborough, I think it's on Netflix<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:27">0:18:27-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  and other places.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:30</a>:</strong>  That's an amazing series.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:30">0:18:30-0:18:32</a>:</strong>  Oh my gosh.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:32">0:18:32-0:18:36</a>:</strong>  David Attenborough, he pulls no punches on climate change and what's going on, all the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:36">0:18:36-0:18:38</a>:</strong>  different species there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:38">0:18:38-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  It is hard to watch, but at least we owe it to the walruses at least to watch this video<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:50</a>:</strong>  because the walruses are in total disarray, total chaos because they've lost their ice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:50">0:18:50-0:18:54</a>:</strong>  They've lost where they actually rest and sun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:54">0:18:54-0:18:59</a>:</strong>  They're crowded on beaches, hundreds of thousands of them at a time where there's no room for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:18:59">0:18:59-0:19:00</a>:</strong>  them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:00">0:19:00-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  And I won't be a spoiler, but to see what they actually, how they respond and what they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:07</a>:</strong>  do is just devastating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:07">0:19:07-0:19:11</a>:</strong>  The fact that they're finding whales beached on like in the German coast, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:11">0:19:11-0:19:13</a>:</strong>  That are basically dyed from plastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:13">0:19:13-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  And this came up in our discussions too on the boat is that if you see two, what does<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:20</a>:</strong>  that mean?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:25</a>:</strong>  If you see two dead whales on an isolated beach somewhere, not all of them beach, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:25">0:19:25-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  How many sank to the bottom?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:34</a>:</strong>  So every time we see something, you have to realize that, wow, what am I not seeing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:34">0:19:34-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  And we're good at that in permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:37</a>:</strong>  We're looking for these patterns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:37">0:19:37-0:19:42</a>:</strong>  So if we see these animals responding this way, we need to then open our eyes and look<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:42">0:19:42-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  much closer at all, whether it's bees, butterflies, birds, all those kinds of things, what's going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:53</a>:</strong>  on because these patterns are very important to us to understand what's going on even for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:53">0:19:53-0:19:54</a>:</strong>  our own survival.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:54">0:19:54-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:20:01</a>:</strong>  These larger patterns are key to understanding how we can interact in a way or start to reverse<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:01">0:20:01-0:20:04</a>:</strong>  some of the damage that's been done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:04">0:20:04-0:20:11</a>:</strong>  But it also relates specifically into the way that we as designers and one of my favorite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:11">0:20:11-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  things about the content that you put out there and the message is integrating this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:20</a>:</strong>  in with a holistic system as a design business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:20">0:20:20-0:20:26</a>:</strong>  Let's talk now about raising the standard specifically for design and what are some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:26">0:20:26-0:20:31</a>:</strong>  of the most notable challenges that you see other ecological designers facing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:31">0:20:31-0:20:32</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:32">0:20:32-0:20:36</a>:</strong>  So in the US, it's fairly straightforward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:36">0:20:36-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  If you want information, you can find it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:43</a>:</strong>  A lot of the data that we need in order to do our base maps, our site assessments, things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:43">0:20:43-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  like that, we have an eight page data table right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:51</a>:</strong>  We call it reunited designers that we share, which are basically, it's a word doc with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:51">0:20:51-0:20:52</a>:</strong>  four columns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:52">0:20:52-0:20:54</a>:</strong>  One is here are the questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:54">0:20:54-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  Here's where you find the answers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:20:58</a>:</strong>  The third one is where you put the answers and the fourth one is recommendations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:20:58">0:20:58-0:21:01</a>:</strong>  There's eight pages of this data.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:01">0:21:01-0:21:05</a>:</strong>  And the biggest problem I think that we have, especially in design, is knowing what the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:05">0:21:05-0:21:07</a>:</strong>  questions are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:07">0:21:07-0:21:11</a>:</strong>  And if you don't know what to do, you haven't asked enough questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:11">0:21:11-0:21:16</a>:</strong>  So knowing what the questions are, getting the answers for those gives our subconscious<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:16">0:21:16-0:21:20</a>:</strong>  the time and the ability to come up with the solutions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:20">0:21:20-0:21:22</a>:</strong>  And that's where insight comes in the design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:22">0:21:22-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  You have to read tons and tons of information, all sorts of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:29</a>:</strong>  It's like I learned, like an art school.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:29">0:21:29-0:21:31</a>:</strong>  Learn everything, then forget it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:31">0:21:31-0:21:35</a>:</strong>  Just learn, forget it because it'll still be back there working its way in your subconscious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:35">0:21:35-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  And when you need a solution, that insight will come forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:44</a>:</strong>  So get in the information, knowing what the questions are, and then also having a very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:44">0:21:44-0:21:45</a>:</strong>  specific process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:45">0:21:45-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  So we have a process list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:52</a>:</strong>  It's like three pages, chronological, all the things we have to do in order to get the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:52">0:21:52-0:21:56</a>:</strong>  information starting with the base map, the data table, client interviews, things like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:56">0:21:56-0:21:57</a>:</strong>  that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:21:57">0:21:57-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  And even if the information doesn't apply when I'm in the Southwest or like Southern<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:05</a>:</strong>  Texas and we're looking for growing degree days and then we're looking for chilling days<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:05">0:22:05-0:22:11</a>:</strong>  for apple fruit and things like that, well, it really, chilling days in Southern Texas,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:11">0:22:11-0:22:15</a>:</strong>  well, still we want to find that information because it might be important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:15">0:22:15-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  And even these things that we think aren't really important, if it exists somewhere,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  we get it in there because it really kind of sculpts the environment for us and gives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  us an idea of what we're working with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  So a real challenge here is still getting the data, getting it organized, doing a very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:31">0:22:31-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  good base map, doing all the testing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:39</a>:</strong>  And then also, it's funny, a lot of challenges I could list, remembering that you have to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:39">0:22:39-0:22:41</a>:</strong>  go in with a sense of awe and ignorance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:41">0:22:41-0:22:44</a>:</strong>  And that's really true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:44">0:22:44-0:22:48</a>:</strong>  I have to go into my jobs with nothing in my tool belt, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:48">0:22:48-0:22:50</a>:</strong>  Nothing ready to go, no preconceived notions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:50">0:22:50-0:22:56</a>:</strong>  And that's actually very freeing to go to some other country or some other state and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:22:56">0:22:56-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  you have to just wipe your brain out and start doing the research and know that your solutions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:03</a>:</strong>  have to apply to that place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:03">0:23:03-0:23:05</a>:</strong>  Not everybody needs a Berman swale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:05">0:23:05-0:23:09</a>:</strong>  Actually very few places I've worked on have done Berman swales, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:09">0:23:09-0:23:13</a>:</strong>  Not every place needs to be key lined, but that's something that needs to be assessed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:13">0:23:13-0:23:15</a>:</strong>  And if it comes up, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:19</a>:</strong>  Now when you do those systems, any of these tools that we have in permaculture and design,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:19">0:23:19-0:23:24</a>:</strong>  it has to be tailored exactly to that place, exactly to the slope, the aspect, the type<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:24">0:23:24-0:23:25</a>:</strong>  of soil that's there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:25">0:23:25-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  There is no one thing that you do everywhere the same way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:33</a>:</strong>  Everything needs to be tailored just because, just like the clothing you're going to wear,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:33">0:23:33-0:23:34</a>:</strong>  just like the seasons.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:34">0:23:34-0:23:37</a>:</strong>  Everything changes and we need to adapt the design to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:37">0:23:37-0:23:41</a>:</strong>  So having all these documents and it takes some time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:41">0:23:41-0:23:46</a>:</strong>  I just got back from Albuquerque yesterday, five days there, working on a restaurant that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:46">0:23:46-0:23:51</a>:</strong>  has a farm attached to it, which is really, really great opportunities there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:51">0:23:51-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  But we have to be really careful with the kind of soils they have and the integration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:23:59</a>:</strong>  that they have with their customers that actually are walking out on the farm, the perception<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:23:59">0:23:59-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  of what's going on in the farm and also the difference between production systems and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:07</a>:</strong>  like the polycultures and ecological systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:07">0:24:07-0:24:08</a>:</strong>  Somehow we do a blend in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:08">0:24:08-0:24:10</a>:</strong>  Of course, permaculture works great for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:10">0:24:10-0:24:16</a>:</strong>  We're a combination of production, agriculture, and the ecological systems which support that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:16">0:24:16-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  We try to bring those two things together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:23</a>:</strong>  So getting overwhelmed is a big problem with these jobs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:23">0:24:23-0:24:27</a>:</strong>  Just like everybody else, it might be two in the morning, you'll wake up and go, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:30</a>:</strong>  have I just got myself into?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:30">0:24:30-0:24:32</a>:</strong>  That's happened a couple of times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:32">0:24:32-0:24:36</a>:</strong>  But I know if you have a process and you have a list of questions, and I have to do it every<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:36">0:24:36-0:24:40</a>:</strong>  time to remind myself, hit that list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:40">0:24:40-0:24:41</a>:</strong>  And the last thing I'll say is-<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:41">0:24:41-0:24:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah, there's no shortcuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:42">0:24:42-0:24:44</a>:</strong>  There really isn't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:44">0:24:44-0:24:49</a>:</strong>  You're going to really get yourself in a situation if you try to jump anything or make any kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:49">0:24:49-0:24:50</a>:</strong>  of assumptions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:50">0:24:50-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  And you have to dig holes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  You have to do a lot of research on the land because just because what you're seeing on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:24:57</a>:</strong>  the surface may not be what it's down deep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:24:57">0:24:57-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  I have a couple of examples of that I can tell you about where, well, we see sand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:06</a>:</strong>  So obviously, the water is just going to infiltrate really fast until the wind blows.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:06">0:25:06-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  And we found that about three inches under that sand is compacted sand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:11</a>:</strong>  It was like concrete.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:11">0:25:11-0:25:14</a>:</strong>  They had a hard pan in a sand field, which was just amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:14">0:25:14-0:25:18</a>:</strong>  And so that's another thing we had to think about with working.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:18">0:25:18-0:25:24</a>:</strong>  So understanding all the systems, getting your list down and following that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:24">0:25:24-0:25:28</a>:</strong>  And what we also have is now, because I teach this as a graduate class at the University<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:28">0:25:28-0:25:31</a>:</strong>  of Minnesota, it's a 15 week semester.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:31">0:25:31-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  We have a rubric for that, which is basically these are all the expectations for the design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:40</a>:</strong>  So we took the design process with all the items on there and we turned it into an Excel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:40">0:25:40-0:25:44</a>:</strong>  spreadsheet and you guys go through and you've got to check off each one of those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:44">0:25:44-0:25:49</a>:</strong>  And as you can imagine, it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger as we add more details.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:49">0:25:49-0:25:53</a>:</strong>  Like when you get into soil sciences and soil tests, all that information that we want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:53">0:25:53-0:25:56</a>:</strong>  find out or make sure we at least looked at it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:25:56">0:25:56-0:26:00</a>:</strong>  Now I've become obsessed with something that you mentioned earlier, and that's the questions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:00">0:26:00-0:26:03</a>:</strong>  that you ask during the design process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:03">0:26:03-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  Not only doing interviews like this one through the podcast, but also working directly with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  clients to help identify their needs, the conditions and the parameters that we're working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:18</a>:</strong>  And I've noticed that the questions that you ask really frame the information that you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:18">0:26:18-0:26:19</a>:</strong>  going to gather.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:19">0:26:19-0:26:23</a>:</strong>  And though you may be looking for the same things, if you ask the same question, even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:23">0:26:23-0:26:29</a>:</strong>  just in a slightly different way, it can really change the way that that information is conveyed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:29">0:26:29-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  or gathered.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  And so my question to you is what are some of the main questions?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:37</a>:</strong>  I know you said you've got a document available online to go through all of this, but among<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:37">0:26:37-0:26:42</a>:</strong>  that list, what are some of the questions that have been most impactful or changed the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:42">0:26:42-0:26:47</a>:</strong>  perspective or the way that you gather information?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:47">0:26:47-0:26:52</a>:</strong>  Well in many cases, like I was saying in the United States, we go online and we can find<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:52">0:26:52-0:26:54</a>:</strong>  anything we want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:54">0:26:54-0:26:58</a>:</strong>  That is not true as most things in the rest of the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:26:58">0:26:58-0:27:03</a>:</strong>  Some of the insight I got, I was working with Neil Bertrando and we were actually in Senegal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:03">0:27:03-0:27:06</a>:</strong>  and I said, you know, Neil, I think we're the anomaly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:06">0:27:06-0:27:10</a>:</strong>  Everywhere I'm going in the world seems to be much more similar than we to themselves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:10">0:27:10-0:27:13</a>:</strong>  than to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:13">0:27:13-0:27:16</a>:</strong>  Everywhere else in the world is much more similar in their agriculture, their building,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:16">0:27:16-0:27:17</a>:</strong>  their structures, things like that, especially.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:17">0:27:17-0:27:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's been true in my experience for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:19">0:27:19-0:27:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:20">0:27:20-0:27:21</a>:</strong>  And where are the strange ones?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:21">0:27:21-0:27:22</a>:</strong>  Where are the odd?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:22">0:27:22-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  And so there comes to kind of a lot of, oh, you might say, I have this whole thing about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:33</a>:</strong>  being a perpetrator in some of the things going on, but I'm also trying to figure out,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:33">0:27:33-0:27:35</a>:</strong>  okay, I'm a perpetrator, but I'm also trying to fix this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:35">0:27:35-0:27:40</a>:</strong>  How do I balance these things living as I do where I live, trying not to have the effect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:40">0:27:40-0:27:41</a>:</strong>  on the rest of the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:41">0:27:41-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  But anyway, we have great resources here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:50</a>:</strong>  You go to another country, you go to a place like we were in Senegal, there are no schools,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:50">0:27:50-0:27:53</a>:</strong>  there is no written language where we're working.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:53">0:27:53-0:27:57</a>:</strong>  How do you get the information that you need to get?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:27:57">0:27:57-0:28:01</a>:</strong>  So that you just start having conversations and you ask questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:01">0:28:01-0:28:08</a>:</strong>  And when we were teaching a class there last fall through Matter, which is a Matter organization,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:08">0:28:08-0:28:10</a>:</strong>  which is in the Twin Cities, it's an NGO.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:10">0:28:10-0:28:13</a>:</strong>  We did a class there on Gorgie Jeng's farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:13">0:28:13-0:28:16</a>:</strong>  He's actually an NBA basketball player for the Timberwolves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:16">0:28:16-0:28:17</a>:</strong>  He has a farm in Senegal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:17">0:28:17-0:28:20</a>:</strong>  So we did a class there at his agricultural center for four days, but the class was not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:20">0:28:20-0:28:21</a>:</strong>  about teaching.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:21">0:28:21-0:28:24</a>:</strong>  It was about finding out and discovery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:24">0:28:24-0:28:28</a>:</strong>  So we have to ask questions in context.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:28">0:28:28-0:28:32</a>:</strong>  It's not about, okay, you're going to ask them what the nitrogen is, what's the organic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:32">0:28:32-0:28:34</a>:</strong>  material in your soil, are you going to do anything?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:34">0:28:34-0:28:35</a>:</strong>  No.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:35">0:28:35-0:28:38</a>:</strong>  You actually first have to find out what do they think soil is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:38">0:28:38-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  How are they acting, what are they working, and work basically from their context, not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:43</a>:</strong>  from ours.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:43">0:28:43-0:28:47</a>:</strong>  And so the whole beginning of that four day course was asking questions about what was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:47">0:28:47-0:28:51</a>:</strong>  it 30 years ago, 20 years ago, what were you growing then?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:51">0:28:51-0:28:54</a>:</strong>  And we got a great response from people, and then asking them about different parts of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:54">0:28:54-0:28:57</a>:</strong>  the country, and what do they do there, and how does that work?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:29:00</a>:</strong>  And after a while, they start seeing the patterns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:00">0:29:00-0:29:03</a>:</strong>  We're just giving terminology to the patterns that they already know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:03">0:29:03-0:29:05</a>:</strong>  This is already information that they have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:05">0:29:05-0:29:11</a>:</strong>  When we were in Haiti, we found an old chalkboard, and we were working there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:11">0:29:11-0:29:13</a>:</strong>  And the first thing we did, we found an old chalkboard, all busted up, laid it on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:13">0:29:13-0:29:17</a>:</strong>  floor, found some chalk, and we asked the people to draw.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:17">0:29:17-0:29:19</a>:</strong>  Who's here who's a good artist?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:19">0:29:19-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  Draw Haiti the best that you can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:23</a>:</strong>  Where are the mountains?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:23">0:29:23-0:29:24</a>:</strong>  Where are the rivers?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:24">0:29:24-0:29:29</a>:</strong>  And they were basically teaching themselves and us what's going on in the island there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:29">0:29:29-0:29:30</a>:</strong>  And then where do things grow?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:30">0:29:30-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  Why did they grow there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  Where do the winds come from?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:33">0:29:33-0:29:34</a>:</strong>  Where do the storms come from?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:34">0:29:34-0:29:38</a>:</strong>  And just like we're doing a sector map, we had this big chalkboard filled with all sorts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:38">0:29:38-0:29:40</a>:</strong>  of drawings and arrows and everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:40">0:29:40-0:29:44</a>:</strong>  And the people that knew the information were teaching it to the people that didn't know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:44">0:29:44-0:29:47</a>:</strong>  And then of course, they're arguing about different things, and about the rivers, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:47">0:29:47-0:29:49</a>:</strong>  the fish, and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:49">0:29:49-0:29:53</a>:</strong>  But at the same time, we're getting informed as to what's going on in the climate, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:53">0:29:53-0:29:56</a>:</strong>  what's going on with the agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:56">0:29:56-0:29:59</a>:</strong>  We were in Haiti also at a different time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:29:59">0:29:59-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  We were learning about some citrus disease that they had, and what was going on with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  the trees, and trying to figure out what that problem was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:09</a>:</strong>  And through the translators and through people that spoke English also in French, finding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:09">0:30:09-0:30:12</a>:</strong>  out, oh, okay, what was the pattern?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:12">0:30:12-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  How did it work?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:15</a>:</strong>  And eventually, of course, they couldn't deal with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:15">0:30:15-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  They didn't have the resource to do it, so they had to pull all their trees out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:22</a>:</strong>  We're taking that information, then we come back to the United States, and we ask people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:22">0:30:22-0:30:26</a>:</strong>  that know these things, so that we can go back and inform them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:26">0:30:26-0:30:29</a>:</strong>  So it's all about asking questions all the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:29">0:30:29-0:30:34</a>:</strong>  Now, what those questions are have to be tailored, of course, basically to the education of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:34">0:30:34-0:30:35</a>:</strong>  people who are there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:35">0:30:35-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  And you might have to do some education first before they can answer the questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:30:42</a>:</strong>  On the other hand, I've been so amazed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:42">0:30:42-0:30:46</a>:</strong>  You go to these countries that some people call illiterate, which bugs me, or third world<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:46">0:30:46-0:30:49</a>:</strong>  or developing, which also bugs me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:49">0:30:49-0:30:52</a>:</strong>  You go there and ask them, and they know everything about the plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:52">0:30:52-0:30:53</a>:</strong>  Which one is used for toothaches?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:53">0:30:53-0:30:55</a>:</strong>  Which one is done for this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:30:58</a>:</strong>  We were going through a woodland area, and everybody is grabbing leaves and nuts and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:30:58">0:30:58-0:31:03</a>:</strong>  berries as we're going through this area, because they're all collecting and foraging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:03">0:31:03-0:31:06</a>:</strong>  for all these material, because they all know what it works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:06">0:31:06-0:31:09</a>:</strong>  So if they have all this indigenous knowledge, what are we there for?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:09">0:31:09-0:31:10</a>:</strong>  Right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:10">0:31:10-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:11">0:31:11-0:31:15</a>:</strong>  We're just there to help them and answer their questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:15">0:31:15-0:31:16</a>:</strong>  What else can we do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:16">0:31:16-0:31:18</a>:</strong>  Let's look at the soil here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:18">0:31:18-0:31:23</a>:</strong>  The four day class that we did in Senegal, the only thing we were teaching them over<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  that four days for them to decide, of course, was soil temperature, the depth and type of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:32</a>:</strong>  soil they have, and the benefits of mulching.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:32">0:31:32-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  That's the only thing that we got out of that four days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  But that was stellar, because they decided through the demonstrations that we did, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  little trials that we did, different ways of watering, digging holes, and all of a sudden<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:47</a>:</strong>  they were saying, oh yeah, we need to do this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:47">0:31:47-0:31:50</a>:</strong>  That makes so much sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:50">0:31:50-0:31:52</a>:</strong>  And so we're not preaching anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:52">0:31:52-0:31:55</a>:</strong>  We're all discovering it at the same time, and I think that's much more effective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:55">0:31:55-0:31:59</a>:</strong>  Of course, when it's their decision and a few of them will adopt it, it's probably more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:31:59">0:31:59-0:32:03</a>:</strong>  likely that they'll adopt it than us coming and saying, here, spend a ton more calories<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:03">0:32:03-0:32:04</a>:</strong>  doing it this way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:04">0:32:04-0:32:06</a>:</strong>  You should get something better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:06">0:32:06-0:32:08</a>:</strong>  It's not how it really works in a lot of these countries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:08">0:32:08-0:32:13</a>:</strong>  Everybody has to spend the calories and risk all that energy in order to get the benefit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:13">0:32:13-0:32:19</a>:</strong>  That is such an important observation, especially when working with cultures that are not your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:19">0:32:19-0:32:23</a>:</strong>  original ones, or when you're going into another environment or context.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:23">0:32:23-0:32:30</a>:</strong>  There is this sort of pervasive stereotype of people going in and acting as sort of saviors<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:30">0:32:30-0:32:33</a>:</strong>  or bringing people out of what we consider to be underdeveloped.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:33">0:32:33-0:32:38</a>:</strong>  And I'm equally perturbed by those terms that you mentioned earlier, underdeveloped, or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:38">0:32:38-0:32:43</a>:</strong>  third world, or things like that, because the knowledge is definitely there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:43">0:32:43-0:32:48</a>:</strong>  It's possibly just not the knowledge that we have traditionally prioritized or given<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:48">0:32:48-0:32:50</a>:</strong>  value to in our culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:50">0:32:50-0:32:54</a>:</strong>  And let's be honest, so many aspects of our culture and the way that we have started to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:32:54">0:32:54-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  domineer our environments are the reason why these overarching defects and disconnection<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:04</a>:</strong>  to natural systems are pervasive all around the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:04">0:33:04-0:33:10</a>:</strong>  And many times the perspectives that we have to offer are just relating the indigenous<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:10">0:33:10-0:33:16</a>:</strong>  knowledge, the connection to nature that they inherently have, and are frankly much stronger<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:16">0:33:16-0:33:22</a>:</strong>  than we have in this part of the overdeveloped world, as we call the global West, is relating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:22">0:33:22-0:33:29</a>:</strong>  it to these sort of unhealthy economic models that would allow them to participate and remove<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:29">0:33:29-0:33:34</a>:</strong>  themselves further from the connection that they have, which is much better than ours.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:34">0:33:34-0:33:37</a>:</strong>  And I'm very glad that you mentioned this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:37">0:33:37-0:33:39</a>:</strong>  It's a co-learning experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:39">0:33:39-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  And if both parties come into it hoping to share and to ask the questions that allow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:52</a>:</strong>  the discovery from the addition of information and perspectives that each side brings, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:52">0:33:52-0:33:57</a>:</strong>  have certainly found in my experience that that creates a much more lasting effect and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:33:57">0:33:57-0:34:02</a>:</strong>  much more likely that the conclusions come out of those interactions are actually going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:02">0:34:02-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  to be implemented rather than, as I've seen in so many other places, especially with NGO<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:14</a>:</strong>  and nonprofit models, when projects are implemented or kind of forced upon the people where you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:14">0:34:14-0:34:19</a>:</strong>  working, as soon as the funding or the support of the maintenance from outside dries up,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:19">0:34:19-0:34:23</a>:</strong>  the projects are abandoned because they were not initiated by the people who they actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:23">0:34:23-0:34:24</a>:</strong>  affect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  There's many, many, many examples of that in every country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:35</a>:</strong>  Reports that were put in, people paid to put them in, as soon as the trees were even harvestable,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:35">0:34:35-0:34:36</a>:</strong>  they got harvested and they weren't taken care of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:36">0:34:36-0:34:37</a>:</strong>  Why?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:37">0:34:37-0:34:39</a>:</strong>  Because nobody was paid to take care of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:39">0:34:39-0:34:41</a>:</strong>  And that was the logic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:41">0:34:41-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  So and kind of to extend to what you're saying too, so there is indigenous knowledge, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:34:48</a>:</strong>  local knowledge and cultural knowledge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:48">0:34:48-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  That's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:34:51</a>:</strong>  All of that is passed down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:51">0:34:51-0:34:54</a>:</strong>  The great thing about it is it doesn't change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:54">0:34:54-0:34:59</a>:</strong>  Knowledge of plants, how they grow, what they look like for the most part, that's what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:34:59">0:34:59-0:35:03</a>:</strong>  great about horticulture and permaculture is that the way this oak tree grows now is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:03">0:35:03-0:35:07</a>:</strong>  the way it's always grown and probably will always grow relative to where it's located<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:07">0:35:07-0:35:10</a>:</strong>  in a climate or its environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:10">0:35:10-0:35:14</a>:</strong>  So you have the cultural practices though, that's where we run into problems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:14">0:35:14-0:35:16</a>:</strong>  And that's here in the United States too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:16">0:35:16-0:35:21</a>:</strong>  Cultural practices are basically like traditional practices where we've always done it this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:21">0:35:21-0:35:22</a>:</strong>  way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:22">0:35:22-0:35:26</a>:</strong>  We don't want to mess with it because this is what has worked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:26">0:35:26-0:35:31</a>:</strong>  And I had this conversation earlier in the week and I've had it in many places where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:31">0:35:31-0:35:33</a>:</strong>  people want to put in native plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:34</a>:</strong>  This is my example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:34">0:35:34-0:35:37</a>:</strong>  In one place I was working, native plants was the key.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:37">0:35:37-0:35:38</a>:</strong>  We just want to do native plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:38">0:35:38-0:35:40</a>:</strong>  I said, great, sounds wonderful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:40">0:35:40-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  Love it, love it, love it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:43</a>:</strong>  Show me a native soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:43">0:35:43-0:35:47</a>:</strong>  Show me the actual ecology that existed when that native plant was here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:47">0:35:47-0:35:51</a>:</strong>  If that's gone, you're not going to have the native plants that existed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:51">0:35:51-0:35:55</a>:</strong>  This whole soil regime, this whole ecology has changed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:35:55">0:35:55-0:36:00</a>:</strong>  If you want to get that back, we have to work on the functional plants with ecological functions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:00">0:36:00-0:36:04</a>:</strong>  that can help bring that soil back so you can have those natives back if you want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:04">0:36:04-0:36:06</a>:</strong>  Otherwise, the slate is different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:06">0:36:06-0:36:07</a>:</strong>  The ecology is different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:07">0:36:07-0:36:09</a>:</strong>  And so we have to start differently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:09">0:36:09-0:36:11</a>:</strong>  And it's the same thing with farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:11">0:36:11-0:36:15</a>:</strong>  Now I'm apt to read a lot more about this, but I was just in Albuquerque and in these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:15">0:36:15-0:36:19</a>:</strong>  fields off the Rio Grande, they do flood irrigation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:19">0:36:19-0:36:22</a>:</strong>  And I went out there when I arrived with my penetrometer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:22">0:36:22-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  It tells you how many square, psi, pounds per square inch it takes to push through the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:28</a>:</strong>  soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:28">0:36:28-0:36:32</a>:</strong>  And at a certain psi, it won't go through and that tells you when you have compaction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:32">0:36:32-0:36:34</a>:</strong>  So you push this down the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:34">0:36:34-0:36:37</a>:</strong>  You can hear it, you can feel it, and you can even see it on the rod when it comes out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:37">0:36:37-0:36:40</a>:</strong>  of the ground, what's going on underground with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:40">0:36:40-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  So I go out in this field and it's like concrete.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  I can't put it on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:47</a>:</strong>  And then they're going to come the next day I hear and flood irrigate this huge field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:47">0:36:47-0:36:52</a>:</strong>  They just turn open these big manhole covers and the water just comes out because it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:52">0:36:52-0:36:56</a>:</strong>  natural water pressure from the canals, from the Rio Grande.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:36:56">0:36:56-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  And by the way, this is a 300 year old system that the Spanish started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:04</a>:</strong>  And that history right there would be worth a lot of reading and study.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:04">0:37:04-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  So anyway, this very old system, they have people that this was the first, you might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:08">0:37:08-0:37:12</a>:</strong>  say governance in the whole United States was governing the water system in the Rio<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:12">0:37:12-0:37:16</a>:</strong>  Grande Valley here, where Albuquerque and what it was, all the different towns that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:16">0:37:16-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  were down there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:21</a>:</strong>  So anyway, they flood irrigate this and I'm thinking, okay, from everything I've ever<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:21">0:37:21-0:37:23</a>:</strong>  heard flood irrigation is bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:23">0:37:23-0:37:25</a>:</strong>  We tried to stop that in Haiti.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:25">0:37:25-0:37:29</a>:</strong>  We're trying to stop this in other areas by doing channeling, by doing drip irrigation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:29">0:37:29-0:37:34</a>:</strong>  by doing spot watering, things like that because flood irrigation just isn't going to work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:34">0:37:34-0:37:38</a>:</strong>  So they flood irrigate it and I'm thinking, wow, there's like four or five inches of water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:38">0:37:38-0:37:39</a>:</strong>  on this field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:39">0:37:39-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  Tomorrow, there's going to be three or four inches of water in this field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:44</a>:</strong>  And I don't know what's going on with this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:44">0:37:44-0:37:49</a>:</strong>  I think I'm saying, I'm questioning this a lot to myself and a little bit with my client<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:49">0:37:49-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  saying, I'm not quite sure this is the way to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:51">0:37:51-0:37:55</a>:</strong>  So anyway, I go out the next day, all the water is gone, absolutely gone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:55">0:37:55-0:37:59</a>:</strong>  I take the penetrometer, it goes three feet into the ground like butter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:37:59">0:37:59-0:38:00</a>:</strong>  It was just amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:00">0:38:00-0:38:05</a>:</strong>  And then I pull it out and it's actually cold from all the water that infiltrated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:05">0:38:05-0:38:10</a>:</strong>  So the soil type that they have there, which is a sandy loam, that crust on the top was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:10">0:38:10-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  really very, very hard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:15</a>:</strong>  But as soon as the water hit it, it seems like all that water just infiltrated, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:15">0:38:15-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  this was an alfalfa field, infiltrated very deep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  So I'm going to have to really look at that because, of course, not wanting to judge on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:27</a>:</strong>  anything and not having to be, okay, absolutely flood irrigation is bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:27">0:38:27-0:38:30</a>:</strong>  Now all of a sudden it's like, wow, this is amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:35</a>:</strong>  Simple energy, gravity fed about once or twice a month, they get allowed to flood this field<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:35">0:38:35-0:38:38</a>:</strong>  and the water just goes way into the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:38">0:38:38-0:38:39</a>:</strong>  So there's something about this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:44</a>:</strong>  Because I was thinking, wow, we're going to have to do a subsoiler key lining on here,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:44">0:38:44-0:38:45</a>:</strong>  something to get the water in the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:45">0:38:45-0:38:49</a>:</strong>  And I was totally off base in my assumptions in that point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:49">0:38:49-0:38:53</a>:</strong>  So there is a cultural practice that's been going on for hundreds of years that I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:53">0:38:53-0:38:54</a>:</strong>  questioning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:54">0:38:54-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  But in the sense it's like, wow, this is amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:39:01</a>:</strong>  So now I have to rethink flood irrigation and what is the situation that you have to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:01">0:39:01-0:39:02</a>:</strong>  be careful of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:02">0:39:02-0:39:08</a>:</strong>  Now if that was heavy clay, like we were in Haiti, that's an issue because the clay comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:08">0:39:08-0:39:09</a>:</strong>  to the top.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:09">0:39:09-0:39:12</a>:</strong>  It just really is not really good for the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:12">0:39:12-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  But for this silty loam, sandy loam, it actually worked perfectly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:16">0:39:16-0:39:18</a>:</strong>  And I was very impressed with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:18">0:39:18-0:39:24</a>:</strong>  So cultural practices as opposed to cultural knowledge, sometimes things are done because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:24">0:39:24-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  they've always been done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:28</a>:</strong>  And cultural practices are kind of the hardest thing to change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:28">0:39:28-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  But it takes one or two people to take the calories and the energy to do it and try it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:38</a>:</strong>  And if all of a sudden they succeed, then everybody will be on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:38">0:39:38-0:39:41</a>:</strong>  Everybody's watching everybody else in every country, every little village that you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:41">0:39:41-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:43</a>:</strong>  So that's the thing we want to change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:43">0:39:43-0:39:44</a>:</strong>  But we also have to watch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:44">0:39:44-0:39:48</a>:</strong>  And I think, and I've said this in Haiti too, you kind of have to be there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:48">0:39:48-0:39:53</a>:</strong>  And I would think you have to be there for like a year, a whole year or a number of seasons<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:53">0:39:53-0:39:54</a>:</strong>  to see how things work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:54">0:39:54-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  You can't just go there for a couple of weeks and judge stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:39:58</a>:</strong>  And that's very difficult.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:39:58">0:39:58-0:40:03</a>:</strong>  Bill Mollison would say that you buy a property, sit on it for a year and watch and observe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:03">0:40:03-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  So that's hard part with the designing too is I've got maybe three months to get ready,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  a couple of months to get ready to go do my research and maybe two weeks there to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:18</a>:</strong>  I wish I could be there for a year in every place and just live it and see what's going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:18">0:40:18-0:40:22</a>:</strong>  on and then be much more informed and probably much more accepted too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:22">0:40:22-0:40:28</a>:</strong>  I love stories like that, especially since like it's very difficult to accept the humility<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:28">0:40:28-0:40:31</a>:</strong>  that those types of realizations bring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:31">0:40:31-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  But just like you said, like the intricacies, the nuances of nature are constantly surprising<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:40</a>:</strong>  me as well, just like you mentioned.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:40">0:40:40-0:40:46</a>:</strong>  And there's never an end to what you can learn or understand or the assumptions that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:46">0:40:46-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  can break when you really observe and take the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:54</a>:</strong>  And I mean, it's really helped me come to some personal conclusions because I've been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:54">0:40:54-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  designing and consulting with clients and projects around the world myself and had much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:40:59">0:40:59-0:41:04</a>:</strong>  like you, like sort of limited times to interact with the communities and the ecosystems in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:04">0:41:04-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  which I've been called in to work on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  And it's really helped me to realize that I would be much more effective as a participant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:19</a>:</strong>  in these projects, as a contributor in the long term, if I really want to see any solutions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:19">0:41:19-0:41:20</a>:</strong>  come.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:20">0:41:20-0:41:28</a>:</strong>  And it's not really supported by the angle in which a lot of work is promoted right now,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:33</a>:</strong>  where you bring someone in, you find solutions, you implement them and then you leave.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:33">0:41:33-0:41:37</a>:</strong>  But especially when you're working with living systems like this, dynamic systems, it's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:37">0:41:37-0:41:40</a>:</strong>  participation, it's a co-evolution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:40">0:41:40-0:41:45</a>:</strong>  And it's really brought me to think that I need to change the approach that I've had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:45">0:41:45-0:41:49</a>:</strong>  over the years, because I've been fortunate that some of my recommendations and designs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:49">0:41:49-0:41:51</a>:</strong>  have worked as well as they have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:51">0:41:51-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  But it's almost at this point in my understanding, a matter of luck.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:01</a>:</strong>  And it's so much to the credit of the people who work on it for the longer term, rather<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:01">0:42:01-0:42:05</a>:</strong>  than my own knowledge or understanding of something, because I've made just as large<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:05">0:42:05-0:42:10</a>:</strong>  of mistakes having assumptions or coming in with preconceived notions like you mentioned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:10">0:42:10-0:42:11</a>:</strong>  before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:12">0:42:12-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  Well, a funny example is to talk about humility.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:19</a>:</strong>  When Neil and I were in Senegal, we were doing the banana circles because they have these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:19">0:42:19-0:42:21</a>:</strong>  sheds, the water is coming off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:21">0:42:21-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  When it does wane, we're trying to direct it to these banana circles and things like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:26</a>:</strong>  that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:26">0:42:26-0:42:29</a>:</strong>  So we're digging them, putting organic material in and making them, kind of sculpting the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:29">0:42:29-0:42:30</a>:</strong>  land to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:30">0:42:30-0:42:31</a>:</strong>  The guys got it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:31">0:42:31-0:42:32</a>:</strong>  They figured out what we were doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:32">0:42:32-0:42:37</a>:</strong>  We came back six months later and they had torn out everything that we had put in and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:37">0:42:37-0:42:39</a>:</strong>  put in their own stuff, which was just great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:39">0:42:39-0:42:44</a>:</strong>  They had papayas going and they had a cotter saw, a sour sop, all these other things going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:44">0:42:44-0:42:45</a>:</strong>  in this system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:45">0:42:45-0:42:47</a>:</strong>  And it's like, it's a structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:47">0:42:47-0:42:48</a>:</strong>  It still works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:48">0:42:48-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  They just decided they wanted to grow something else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:51">0:42:51-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:42:54</a>:</strong>  Maybe we just didn't ask enough questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:54">0:42:54-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  They understood the system and yes, it was working.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:43:01</a>:</strong>  The water was going in these holes there, the pits, organic material was there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:01">0:43:01-0:43:03</a>:</strong>  Are we putting in some manure that they're finding?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:03">0:43:03-0:43:04</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:04">0:43:04-0:43:11</a>:</strong>  So you have to allow these people, wherever you go, these people, your clients, your customers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:11">0:43:11-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  you're advocating for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  You have to let them put their spin on it and either fail or adjust it however they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:21</a>:</strong>  want so they can experiment and learn themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:21">0:43:21-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  A lot of this, it is all about education and understanding the variabilities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  I'm getting educated every time I do a project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:30">0:43:30-0:43:32</a>:</strong>  I'm trying to educate people and here's what I've seen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:32">0:43:32-0:43:35</a>:</strong>  Here are the stories from these different places, but you have to give people in every<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:35">0:43:35-0:43:42</a>:</strong>  situation that opportunity to learn, decide, and to see what the variabilities are so they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:42">0:43:42-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  can basically take ownership of it and not just us coming in and saying, look, I saw<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  this in a book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:50</a>:</strong>  We're going to do this cause it was in this book, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:50">0:43:50-0:43:52</a>:</strong>  They saw the structure and they say, Oh, I see how this works, but I'm going to grow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:52">0:43:52-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  something different, which is absolutely the best way to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:01</a>:</strong>  And so with that observation, what do you think most designers in, in your observation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:01">0:44:01-0:44:05</a>:</strong>  or your experience sort of missing when creating functional designs that truly meet the needs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:05">0:44:05-0:44:09</a>:</strong>  of a piece of land and its owners or stewards?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:09">0:44:09-0:44:11</a>:</strong>  Wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:11">0:44:11-0:44:13</a>:</strong>  Missing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:13">0:44:13-0:44:19</a>:</strong>  So my, I have limited experience, you might say, with seeing other people's work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:19">0:44:19-0:44:20</a>:</strong>  I have to be honest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:20">0:44:20-0:44:24</a>:</strong>  I try to keep up with things, social media, Facebook, all that kind of stuff that's going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:24">0:44:24-0:44:25</a>:</strong>  on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:25">0:44:25-0:44:29</a>:</strong>  I don't see enough longterm, you know, you see when it first goes in, Hey, here's our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:29">0:44:29-0:44:30</a>:</strong>  food forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:30">0:44:30-0:44:34</a>:</strong>  The first six months, you never see anything again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:34">0:44:34-0:44:36</a>:</strong>  Stroud bale houses, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:36">0:44:36-0:44:40</a>:</strong>  You see everything going in, but you don't actually get to see it five, 10 years later.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:40">0:44:40-0:44:43</a>:</strong>  Some of it obviously is very new.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:43">0:44:43-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  So there are a couple of things that was missing that were missing for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:44:54</a>:</strong>  And this is when I started getting into ecological restoration with John Liu, ecosystem restoration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:54">0:44:54-0:44:59</a>:</strong>  programs, things like that was what they're calling the four returns from common land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:44:59">0:44:59-0:45:03</a>:</strong>  So, and I thought that was very important when we're doing this ecological design on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:03">0:45:03-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  the properties, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:09</a>:</strong>  Is that there has to be much more than just the harvest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:09">0:45:09-0:45:14</a>:</strong>  There also needs to be some kind of economic benefit from them, especially wherever they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:14">0:45:14-0:45:15</a>:</strong>  are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:15">0:45:15-0:45:18</a>:</strong>  Not everybody can make your own shoes and clothing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:18">0:45:18-0:45:19</a>:</strong>  They're going to have to buy something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:19">0:45:19-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  So there is some kind of economic system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:25</a>:</strong>  So as much as there's subsistence in all of this, which we really want, they also have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:25">0:45:25-0:45:29</a>:</strong>  to have something of value that they can, so they can be part of the economic system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:29">0:45:29-0:45:35</a>:</strong>  locally in their village or in the region so they can get their needs met that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:35">0:45:35-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  So there also has to be a social aspect to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:38">0:45:38-0:45:42</a>:</strong>  And that comes with, I think, creativity and change and talking to people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:42">0:45:42-0:45:45</a>:</strong>  And that's about organizing everybody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:45">0:45:45-0:45:49</a>:</strong>  Mark Bayruthy from Lebanon works with people in Lebanon and building farmer co-ops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:49">0:45:49-0:45:54</a>:</strong>  And he was actually with us in Senegal for the class explaining how the co-ops work with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:54">0:45:54-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  the farmers in Lebanon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:57</a>:</strong>  And it was really fascinating coming together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:57">0:45:57-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  These are our crops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:45:59</a>:</strong>  This is what we're growing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:45:59">0:45:59-0:46:04</a>:</strong>  How can we do this together for standards of quality and things like that, and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:04">0:46:04-0:46:07</a>:</strong>  find a market so that we all can work together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:07">0:46:07-0:46:12</a>:</strong>  So that kind of social bond of farmers working together, subsistence farmers or whatever,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:12">0:46:12-0:46:13</a>:</strong>  that's very important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:13">0:46:13-0:46:15</a>:</strong>  And that also needs to be worked into our designs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:15">0:46:15-0:46:18</a>:</strong>  How does it work with the whole community?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:18">0:46:18-0:46:21</a>:</strong>  Are there more people that can get involved with this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:21">0:46:21-0:46:24</a>:</strong>  There's the spiritual side of this also.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:24">0:46:24-0:46:28</a>:</strong>  And then of course there's the ecological benefit of growing systems or basically growing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:28">0:46:28-0:46:29</a>:</strong>  food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:29">0:46:29-0:46:33</a>:</strong>  And like I like to say, I have our main points and I might say we have a lot of main points,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:33">0:46:33-0:46:37</a>:</strong>  but one of them is we're always trying to build the natural capital.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:37">0:46:37-0:46:39</a>:</strong>  That's a big word phrase for me, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:39">0:46:39-0:46:41</a>:</strong>  The soils need to be better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:41">0:46:41-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  The nutrients need to be better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:45</a>:</strong>  The water needs to be held better in the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:45">0:46:45-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  Everything needs to improve by building the natural capital because that's the actual<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:46:54</a>:</strong>  wealth of land is all the nutrients and the ecological systems on it and its ability to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:46:54">0:46:54-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  carry food or carry animals, which brings us to the carrying capacity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:01</a>:</strong>  That term is used.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:01">0:47:01-0:47:05</a>:</strong>  It's called decay in biological terms, but there's a carrying capacity to every ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:05">0:47:05-0:47:06</a>:</strong>  system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:06">0:47:06-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  As we raise the natural capital, boom, boom, boom, carrying capacity goes up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:14</a>:</strong>  Richer soils holds more water, bigger harvest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:14">0:47:14-0:47:18</a>:</strong>  More harvest, more organic material, better soils, bigger harvest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:18">0:47:18-0:47:22</a>:</strong>  More animals can go on this pasture now because we keep building more soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:22">0:47:22-0:47:23</a>:</strong>  We raise the natural capital.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:23">0:47:23-0:47:28</a>:</strong>  We improve the soil, the nutrient load on that, maybe better plants, different plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:28">0:47:28-0:47:30</a>:</strong>  seeds, things like that for the cattle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:30">0:47:30-0:47:34</a>:</strong>  So raising the natural capital means raising the carrying capacity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:34">0:47:34-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  And that's a big part of the design is an expectation that when we leave or when they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:44</a>:</strong>  start putting in the design, like with permaculture in general, it doesn't take a lot of interest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:44">0:47:44-0:47:48</a>:</strong>  It needs inputs, but it needs to constantly be regenerating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:48">0:47:48-0:47:52</a>:</strong>  Or like Alana Bliss was saying the other day, just generating, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:52">0:47:52-0:47:54</a>:</strong>  Maybe not regenerative, but just generative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:54">0:47:54-0:47:57</a>:</strong>  It just needs to generate constantly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:47:57">0:47:57-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  Nutrient cycles like every forest does, every jungle, everywhere in the tropics, even in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  the desert, things build and build over time at different rates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:05">0:48:05-0:48:10</a>:</strong>  So that's what our designs need to make sure that we have is a nutrient cycling system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:10">0:48:10-0:48:15</a>:</strong>  that's inherent in the design so that the soils are better every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:15">0:48:15-0:48:17</a>:</strong>  The water holding capacity is better every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:17">0:48:17-0:48:22</a>:</strong>  And then the animals and the health of the, of the property is better every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:22">0:48:22-0:48:28</a>:</strong>  And it sounds to me like that is inextricably linked with the resilience of those systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:28">0:48:28-0:48:33</a>:</strong>  Like you may be able to have a higher carrying capacity for humans by wiping out some of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:33">0:48:33-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  the diversity, cultivating things as monocrops and increasing the calories available to one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:39</a>:</strong>  species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:39">0:48:39-0:48:44</a>:</strong>  But in turn, you completely deplete the resiliency of that system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:44">0:48:44-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  You create it to be dependent on outside inputs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:51</a>:</strong>  And as soon as those dry up, it can't sustain itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:51">0:48:51-0:48:54</a>:</strong>  And the carrying capacity then dips majorly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:48:54">0:48:54-0:49:00</a>:</strong>  And so there's a certain amount of species diversity within a resilient system that is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:00">0:49:00-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  absolutely necessary for the carrying capacity for humans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:05">0:49:05-0:49:09</a>:</strong>  Because most people kind of think of it in the longterm, how many people can be sustained<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:09">0:49:09-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  by that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  It's not necessarily just how much resource we can create available for us, but how much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  those resources can regenerate themselves in a sustainable and a resilient way in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:22</a>:</strong>  longterm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:22">0:49:22-0:49:23</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:23">0:49:23-0:49:27</a>:</strong>  And being resilient means to be able to respond to disturbance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:27">0:49:27-0:49:28</a>:</strong>  Of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:28">0:49:28-0:49:29</a>:</strong>  Changes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:29">0:49:29-0:49:34</a>:</strong>  And like people who have cattle, they have cold season grasses, warm season grasses,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:34">0:49:34-0:49:37</a>:</strong>  wet season grasses, dry season grasses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:37">0:49:37-0:49:42</a>:</strong>  They know the importance of a diverse grasses and forbs and things in the field for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:43</a>:</strong>  cattle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:43">0:49:43-0:49:46</a>:</strong>  The only way that it can support the cattle is they have to be ready for every kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:46">0:49:46-0:49:51</a>:</strong>  disturbance, every kind of extreme weather situation so that these cattle can actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:51">0:49:51-0:49:55</a>:</strong>  graze and they can have a profit and they can put on weight.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:49:55">0:49:55-0:50:00</a>:</strong>  Well, we need to really look at that on our properties and we're doing the design too,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:00">0:50:00-0:50:05</a>:</strong>  because the diversity means that when it is hot or we have dry weather, we have plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:05">0:50:05-0:50:07</a>:</strong>  that actually are fine with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:07">0:50:07-0:50:11</a>:</strong>  It's within their tolerance range, if not an expectation in order to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:11">0:50:11-0:50:15</a>:</strong>  And then we need something in a wet cold season when other plants might have fungus or there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:15">0:50:15-0:50:20</a>:</strong>  might be disease or when the humidity is really high, other plants aren't affected by that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:20">0:50:20-0:50:22</a>:</strong>  And that's where diversity comes in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:22">0:50:22-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  I've been experimenting with this in an extreme sort of way with pistachios.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:32</a>:</strong>  I've never grown pistachios and I'm working with the graces of my clients on this, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:32">0:50:32-0:50:37</a>:</strong>  pistachios need a very warm, dry, long dry season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:37">0:50:37-0:50:41</a>:</strong>  Now the tree will survive and like a lot of plants that you can grow, like here we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:41">0:50:41-0:50:45</a>:</strong>  have apricots or we can have different things, but we'll probably not get a harvest maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:45">0:50:45-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  once every five years when the weather is perfect and the frost was at a certain date<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:50">0:50:50-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  and we had all these conditions were just right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:55</a>:</strong>  But then when you do, you get this huge bumper crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:50:55">0:50:55-0:51:00</a>:</strong>  So the same thing in these areas where we know the pistachios will survive if they have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:00">0:51:00-0:51:05</a>:</strong>  a drought, if they have a log hot, dry summer, guess what tree is really going to rally in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:05">0:51:05-0:51:06</a>:</strong>  that situation?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:06">0:51:06-0:51:08</a>:</strong>  It's going to be the pistachios.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:08">0:51:08-0:51:11</a>:</strong>  Now this needs a lot of refinement and we're playing with this in Albuquerque, we're playing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:11">0:51:11-0:51:17</a>:</strong>  with this in Maryland of all places so that when everything is under stress, you also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:17">0:51:17-0:51:21</a>:</strong>  have plants that actually love that kind of weather and that's where diversity comes in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:21">0:51:21-0:51:23</a>:</strong>  Fire is the same thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:23">0:51:23-0:51:28</a>:</strong>  We have these disturbances and we've had a lot of fire in the news on the West Coast,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:28">0:51:28-0:51:33</a>:</strong>  actually all around the world and understanding that we need a diverse kinds of trees, diverse<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:33">0:51:33-0:51:38</a>:</strong>  kinds of plants that actually reduce or resist flames or reduce going on fire as opposed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:38">0:51:38-0:51:45</a>:</strong>  to say in Portugal where they had a monoculture eucalyptus, which my friends now in California<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:45">0:51:45-0:51:49</a>:</strong>  are finding that they're just cutting them down because eucalyptus is a nasty fire tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:49">0:51:49-0:51:51</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah, I found that while I was there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:51">0:51:51-0:51:57</a>:</strong>  It was so big a part of the narrative that they planned to them for specific reasons<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:51:57">0:51:57-0:52:01</a>:</strong>  back then, but now that the fire season and the extent of the area that it affects is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:01">0:52:01-0:52:05</a>:</strong>  much larger, it's one of the most dangerous trees that you could have mature in those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:05">0:52:05-0:52:06</a>:</strong>  types of areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:06">0:52:06-0:52:11</a>:</strong>  The bark peels off it like newspaper on fire and flies through the air and so if you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:11">0:52:11-0:52:16</a>:</strong>  any wind and it burns very, very hot and like the ones we saw in Portugal, the trees that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:16">0:52:16-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  burn fully, they actually burned into the ground and burned the roots.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:22</a>:</strong>  So there are all these holes in the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:22">0:52:22-0:52:27</a>:</strong>  Of course, maybe a very hard way of making biochar, but all these roots actually burned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:27">0:52:27-0:52:28</a>:</strong>  into the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:28">0:52:28-0:52:33</a>:</strong>  So you can imagine the ground being now sterilized around these roots because they're burning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:33">0:52:33-0:52:37</a>:</strong>  at super high temperatures with all the oil that's in these trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:37">0:52:37-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  So kind of back to your question, so diversity in all cases and always possible because it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:48</a>:</strong>  an ecological system that we're trying to make that fits our system and like I like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:54</a>:</strong>  to say in our design process and site assessment is that we will be imprinted by the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:54">0:52:54-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  We're not imprinting on the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:52:58</a>:</strong>  We need to change our tastes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:52:58">0:52:58-0:53:03</a>:</strong>  We need to change our expectation of the food and adapt our lifestyle to where we live like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:03">0:53:03-0:53:08</a>:</strong>  everybody else does in the rest of the world over thousands and tens of thousands of years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:08">0:53:08-0:53:12</a>:</strong>  They've adapted and created their culture and their lifestyle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:12">0:53:12-0:53:17</a>:</strong>  Everybody from the Inuit, right, to the people in Senegal, to the people in Haiti, the indigenous<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:17">0:53:17-0:53:23</a>:</strong>  people have built cultures by adapting their life to the situation that they're in and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:23">0:53:23-0:53:24</a>:</strong>  they've rallied for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:24">0:53:24-0:53:29</a>:</strong>  There is no reason to disparage people who are living subsistence lifestyles because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:29">0:53:29-0:53:34</a>:</strong>  they've learned to adapt and they are actually doing so much less damage to the land than<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:34">0:53:34-0:53:39</a>:</strong>  people who have learned to extract it and take more from it by imprinting what they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:39">0:53:39-0:53:42</a>:</strong>  think is necessary for a lifestyle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:42">0:53:42-0:53:43</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:43">0:53:43-0:53:47</a>:</strong>  Now here, let's take a little change in direction for a second and focus a little bit on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:47">0:53:47-0:53:51</a>:</strong>  business side of running a design firm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:51">0:53:51-0:53:56</a>:</strong>  Let's talk about, first of all, some of the challenges on the business side, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:56">0:53:56-0:53:58</a>:</strong>  when it comes to finding clients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:58">0:53:58-0:53:59</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:53:59">0:53:59-0:54:05</a>:</strong>  So in my case, I was pretty lucky because I was a freelance photographer designer for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:05">0:54:05-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  25 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:11</a>:</strong>  Independent, you might say a lone wolf much of the time doing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:11">0:54:11-0:54:16</a>:</strong>  So learning about relationships and promoting my work, what I want to show people in order<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:16">0:54:16-0:54:19</a>:</strong>  to get the projects, that was great in a commercial setting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:19">0:54:19-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  In the ecological setting and especially in permaculture and ecological design, it's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:25</a>:</strong>  little bit harder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:25">0:54:25-0:54:27</a>:</strong>  It's not a local field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:27">0:54:27-0:54:32</a>:</strong>  You really have to spread out and be willing to travel and be willing to take some risks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:32">0:54:32-0:54:35</a>:</strong>  in doing work and elsewhere by understanding the actual principles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:35">0:54:35-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  Like I was talking about having a process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:42</a>:</strong>  It doesn't matter where I go because I have this process like a lot of us do, site assessment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:42">0:54:42-0:54:45</a>:</strong>  I just need to be humble and find out the information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:45">0:54:45-0:54:48</a>:</strong>  So you kind of have to spread out where you can work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:48">0:54:48-0:54:52</a>:</strong>  Otherwise, if you're just working locally, you're kind of limiting yourself on the availability<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:52">0:54:52-0:54:56</a>:</strong>  of type of work that you can do and you're going to just generally do what everybody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:56">0:54:56-0:54:57</a>:</strong>  else does.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:54:57">0:54:57-0:55:00</a>:</strong>  Now, of course, I don't want to put down general landscaping.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:00">0:55:00-0:55:02</a>:</strong>  I have a lot of friends in permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:02">0:55:02-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  That's what they do and they influence everybody in suburbia and urban areas bringing in permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:12</a>:</strong>  and ecological design into the ornamental design to the aesthetic designs that they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:12">0:55:12-0:55:14</a>:</strong>  doing on land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:14">0:55:14-0:55:16</a>:</strong>  It's funny to hear about the surprising plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:16">0:55:16-0:55:19</a>:</strong>  They'll just put them in the landscape and they look beautiful and then they'll get a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:19">0:55:19-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  call from the owner going, hey, there's these great berries on these plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:22">0:55:22-0:55:23</a>:</strong>  What are those for?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:23">0:55:23-0:55:24</a>:</strong>  And you say, oh, you eat those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:24">0:55:24-0:55:28</a>:</strong>  Oh, and by the way, you can eat all these other ones too for this part of the design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:28">0:55:28-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  Nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:29">0:55:29-0:55:32</a>:</strong>  Kind of subversive ecological landscaping.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:32">0:55:32-0:55:36</a>:</strong>  A little bit of gentle gorilla landscaping.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:36">0:55:36-0:55:42</a>:</strong>  So in a business sense, you really have to decide what you want to do and then figure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:42">0:55:42-0:55:43</a>:</strong>  out where that market is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:43">0:55:43-0:55:44</a>:</strong>  And that's with any kind of art.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:44">0:55:44-0:55:46</a>:</strong>  It's really any kind of business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:46">0:55:46-0:55:48</a>:</strong>  What are you happy with?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:48">0:55:48-0:55:52</a>:</strong>  And then try to make that work and get that out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:52">0:55:52-0:55:56</a>:</strong>  I would, in a sense, try to be, especially when we have more and more people coming into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:56">0:55:56-0:55:59</a>:</strong>  the field, is find a specialty.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:55:59">0:55:59-0:56:04</a>:</strong>  Find something that you can be extreme about and that you can be known for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:04">0:56:04-0:56:07</a>:</strong>  That's a way to get hired and to be seen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:07">0:56:07-0:56:11</a>:</strong>  Now in my case, unashamedly, I have about five Facebook pages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:11">0:56:11-0:56:13</a>:</strong>  I've got three websites.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:13">0:56:13-0:56:19</a>:</strong>  I'm involved with a number of organizations because I want to get my material out there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:19">0:56:19-0:56:21</a>:</strong>  as much as possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:21">0:56:21-0:56:25</a>:</strong>  Every time I do a design, every time I'm doing something interesting or find something new,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:25">0:56:25-0:56:30</a>:</strong>  let everybody know because it's an opportunity to see the graphics that I really like doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:30">0:56:30-0:56:35</a>:</strong>  and the style that I like to show people in order to move that kind of standard that I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:35">0:56:35-0:56:37</a>:</strong>  looking for to move that forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:37">0:56:37-0:56:43</a>:</strong>  So promoting yourself with what you do, a website, of course, is needed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:43">0:56:43-0:56:46</a>:</strong>  A very good website that's well done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:46">0:56:46-0:56:51</a>:</strong>  I just redid southwoodscenter.com, Warushka Kierkegaard, who is one of our United Designers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:51">0:56:51-0:56:52</a>:</strong>  in the Netherlands.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:52">0:56:52-0:56:54</a>:</strong>  She was an interior designer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:54">0:56:54-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  She's a permaculture and ecological designer now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:57:00</a>:</strong>  Interesting change, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:00">0:57:00-0:57:03</a>:</strong>  And of course, she was just saying, Dan, you got to fix this website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:03">0:57:03-0:57:06</a>:</strong>  My website was like, it's old school, I have to admit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:06">0:57:06-0:57:09</a>:</strong>  And she just took it apart and put it back together and I really love it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:09">0:57:09-0:57:11</a>:</strong>  That's southwoodscenter.com.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:11">0:57:11-0:57:15</a>:</strong>  It's just design work, focusing on what I do as opposed to a lot of other things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:15">0:57:15-0:57:20</a>:</strong>  And I think that really was the key is focus on your best type of work, what you can be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:20">0:57:20-0:57:26</a>:</strong>  an expert at, put all your time into that, whether it's mushrooms or water systems or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:26">0:57:26-0:57:28</a>:</strong>  like Brad Lancaster, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:28">0:57:28-0:57:32</a>:</strong>  It takes time, but be known for what is successful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:32">0:57:32-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  It might be mushrooms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:38</a>:</strong>  It might be cheeses or it might be ecological, anything, anything you can find out that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:38">0:57:38-0:57:41</a>:</strong>  might want to do as a product or as a system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:41">0:57:41-0:57:42</a>:</strong>  Be very good at that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:42">0:57:42-0:57:46</a>:</strong>  Think of your marketing, think of your reputation and then your brand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:46">0:57:46-0:57:47</a>:</strong>  And that's very important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:47">0:57:47-0:57:48</a>:</strong>  Have a name.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:48">0:57:48-0:57:51</a>:</strong>  Now, Southwoods here was the name of our property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:51">0:57:51-0:57:55</a>:</strong>  It actually came from a previous business, but I kind of liked it, so I kept it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:55">0:57:55-0:57:57</a>:</strong>  Now that I have it, I can't really change it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:57:57">0:57:57-0:58:01</a>:</strong>  So it's very important to know what the name of your company is going to be so that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:01">0:58:01-0:58:02</a>:</strong>  can be seen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:02">0:58:02-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  I'm also a graphic designer, so logos are very important to me in the presence of my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:09</a>:</strong>  being able to see my work, especially at conferences and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:09">0:58:09-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  They can recognize my style.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:15</a>:</strong>  Now, marketing yourself of course is very important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:15">0:58:15-0:58:19</a>:</strong>  It's like any business and once you're doing any kind of business, it doesn't matter if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:19">0:58:19-0:58:23</a>:</strong>  you're in permaculture or it doesn't matter what you're doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:23">0:58:23-0:58:25</a>:</strong>  Business practices are universal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:25">0:58:25-0:58:29</a>:</strong>  Good business practices cannot change whether using QuickBooks, whatever kind of accounting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:29">0:58:29-0:58:34</a>:</strong>  system, getting yourself a tax ID, getting licensed, getting all these things taken care<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:34">0:58:34-0:58:35</a>:</strong>  of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:35">0:58:35-0:58:37</a>:</strong>  It's like the infrastructure of your farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:37">0:58:37-0:58:42</a>:</strong>  We can do all these fancy things in the landscape, but if your electrical system is bad and your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:42">0:58:42-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  well isn't good and your driveway is full of potholes, that doesn't really help getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:58:49</a>:</strong>  everything else work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:49">0:58:49-0:58:54</a>:</strong>  So getting a business consultant, maybe some classes about how to run a business is very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:54">0:58:54-0:58:55</a>:</strong>  good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:55">0:58:55-0:58:58</a>:</strong>  Plus you have all these people online now, they're trying to help you do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:58:58">0:58:58-0:59:02</a>:</strong>  Some very good online courses now with business structure and with the work that I'm going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:02">0:59:02-0:59:06</a>:</strong>  to do in my courses coming up, we do talk about business, but we're mostly focusing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:06">0:59:06-0:59:12</a>:</strong>  on ecological design using Illustrator or advanced technical drawing skills.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:12">0:59:12-0:59:15</a>:</strong>  I really like what you mentioned there and it's definitely been my experience that would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:15">0:59:15-0:59:18</a>:</strong>  echo that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:18">0:59:18-0:59:21</a>:</strong>  I was not educated in business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:21">0:59:21-0:59:26</a>:</strong>  I didn't even go through the normal university path of formal education.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:26">0:59:26-0:59:31</a>:</strong>  As I was starting to put together my services and offer them to clients, as soon as I started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:31">0:59:31-0:59:39</a>:</strong>  to get fancy or start to get a little bit too niche, I found that the problems that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:39">0:59:39-0:59:45</a>:</strong>  were holding me back were always rooted in the fundamentals, the things that are structural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:45">0:59:45-0:59:49</a>:</strong>  that were either broken or not fully well thought out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:49">0:59:49-0:59:53</a>:</strong>  Even to this day, as I start to move into different offerings and different types of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:53">0:59:53-0:59:58</a>:</strong>  content and services that I've offered through my own company, whenever I hit a snag, I always<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=0:59:58">0:59:58-1:00:02</a>:</strong>  find that the root problem of that is just the basics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:02">1:00:02-1:00:07</a>:</strong>  I didn't bother to put in systems for the accounting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:07">1:00:07-1:00:10</a>:</strong>  I overlooked something that was very, very basic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:10">1:00:10-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  I think that's fantastic advice for anybody getting into any type of business is really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:19</a>:</strong>  put your efforts into establishing a base, a really solid foundation that you can then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:19">1:00:19-1:00:24</a>:</strong>  expand onto other offerings and products or services.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:24">1:00:24-1:00:33</a>:</strong>  Now in your own experience with so many different types of businesses and collaborations that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:33">1:00:33-1:00:39</a>:</strong>  you've done, what have been some of the challenges and the rewards of collaboration and not just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:39">1:00:39-1:00:43</a>:</strong>  going it on your own, even though you started as a freelancer, you've started to work a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:43">1:00:43-1:00:46</a>:</strong>  lot with other organizations and people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:46">1:00:46-1:00:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:48">1:00:48-1:00:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:49">1:00:49-1:00:54</a>:</strong>  So the joy of doing design is like anything else, going to see a movie, camping, whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:54">1:00:54-1:00:58</a>:</strong>  it is, is to work with other people and share it with other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:00:58">1:00:58-1:01:02</a>:</strong>  So a shared experience is twice as fun, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:02">1:01:02-1:01:10</a>:</strong>  You also are sharing the responsibility and the anxiety and the stress of that work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:10">1:01:10-1:01:14</a>:</strong>  And one of the things that I have to get better at, and I'm pretty good at it generally speaking,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:14">1:01:14-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  but more and more you need to jump on it faster, is delegating and bringing in partners in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:18">1:01:18-1:01:21</a>:</strong>  design to help share the experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:21">1:01:21-1:01:23</a>:</strong>  Now there are many cases where that's obvious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:23">1:01:23-1:01:28</a>:</strong>  When I'm working in another country, say the project that we have in Poland that I'm working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:28">1:01:28-1:01:33</a>:</strong>  on, immediately I'm trying to find somebody close by that understands, if not speaks the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:33">1:01:33-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  language, that can help me work with that so they can fill in the blanks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:37">1:01:37-1:01:42</a>:</strong>  I think it's important to know, and I think for myself especially, it's design and it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:42">1:01:42-1:01:48</a>:</strong>  design process, but it needs to be informed by the correct content.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:48">1:01:48-1:01:53</a>:</strong>  So I could say design a magazine, have the fantastic design, but if the content is bad<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:53">1:01:53-1:01:56</a>:</strong>  and the articles are bad, it's not written well, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:56">1:01:56-1:01:57</a>:</strong>  That's not going to work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:57">1:01:57-1:01:58</a>:</strong>  It's not going to sell.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:01:58">1:01:58-1:02:04</a>:</strong>  So I need to be informed for the design by the quality information, and that means partnering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:04">1:02:04-1:02:05</a>:</strong>  with people that work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:05">1:02:05-1:02:10</a>:</strong>  Now in the case in Poland, it was great because I'm working with Boruska, Kierkegaard in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:10">1:02:10-1:02:13</a>:</strong>  Netherlands, and she's Danish.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:13">1:02:13-1:02:15</a>:</strong>  She grew up near the ocean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:15">1:02:15-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  She understood estuaries and what's going on in Northern Europe with that, a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:23</a>:</strong>  the plants and the symbols, and was greatly helping me information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:23">1:02:23-1:02:28</a>:</strong>  Plus she speaks the languages in order to do the data mining to find out this information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:28">1:02:28-1:02:31</a>:</strong>  So in an international sense, it's required that you find somebody local, and it's pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:31">1:02:31-1:02:36</a>:</strong>  easy to do in permaculture circles on many levels or through references.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:36">1:02:36-1:02:41</a>:</strong>  But just say, even in the biome that you might be, especially when I'm going to dry lands,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:41">1:02:41-1:02:45</a>:</strong>  and I'd mentioned Neil Bertrando before, as soon as I hit dry lands, if I'm in Senegal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:45">1:02:45-1:02:50</a>:</strong>  or if I went to Haiti or anywhere else, I have a dry land person and that's Neil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:50">1:02:50-1:02:54</a>:</strong>  And Neil's got it down because he lives in Reno, which is not necessarily super dry,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:54">1:02:54-1:02:56</a>:</strong>  but it's dry, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:56">1:02:56-1:02:57</a>:</strong>  And he studied that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:02:57">1:02:57-1:03:00</a>:</strong>  Like I said about being extreme and having a specialty.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:00">1:03:00-1:03:04</a>:</strong>  So the more I work with him in these different other dry areas, the better he gets, the more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:04">1:03:04-1:03:07</a>:</strong>  informed he gets, and we both win on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:07">1:03:07-1:03:12</a>:</strong>  And then we also have a nice little design to show other people and promote each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:12">1:03:12-1:03:16</a>:</strong>  So finding people right off the bat that are experts in the area that you're working or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:16">1:03:16-1:03:20</a>:</strong>  understand that the best, like the tropics, when I was doing some work in Costa Rica,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:20">1:03:20-1:03:25</a>:</strong>  Nick Tittle was in Thailand, emailed him and said, hey, I got this and this and this going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:25">1:03:25-1:03:26</a>:</strong>  on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:26">1:03:26-1:03:29</a>:</strong>  Can you tell me the polycultures that would work and help us with that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:29">1:03:29-1:03:34</a>:</strong>  And he sent me about 17 different tropical polycultures that we just had to massage a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:34">1:03:34-1:03:39</a>:</strong>  little bit for working in Costa Rica, and we still use those today in the tropics, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:39">1:03:39-1:03:44</a>:</strong>  Talk about saving me so much time and I learned and accelerated my learning process, but it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:44">1:03:44-1:03:49</a>:</strong>  is very important to get the right content because like I say, it's the word design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:49">1:03:49-1:03:54</a>:</strong>  That's what I do, but my design needs to be informed by good information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:54">1:03:54-1:03:59</a>:</strong>  Now the other part of doing that too is there are skills and say the data mining and building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:03:59">1:03:59-1:04:03</a>:</strong>  the base map that is good work and I actually enjoy that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:03">1:04:03-1:04:07</a>:</strong>  But on these larger projects I need to start delegating and this is how we create better<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:07">1:04:07-1:04:10</a>:</strong>  designers and bring up people in design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:10">1:04:10-1:04:14</a>:</strong>  I need to start delegating those foundational tasks to other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:14">1:04:14-1:04:18</a>:</strong>  I love data mining, going on the internet, getting those endorphins flying, finding out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:18">1:04:18-1:04:23</a>:</strong>  all sorts of information, going off and living tangents all the time is a lot of fun, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:23">1:04:23-1:04:28</a>:</strong>  I need other people to do that now so I can focus on the concepts and the bigger problems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:28">1:04:28-1:04:32</a>:</strong>  and trying to develop the different strategies that we're going to use and also get more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:32">1:04:32-1:04:33</a>:</strong>  work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:33">1:04:33-1:04:38</a>:</strong>  The more people I have and the more working and the faster we get this done, now our bigger<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:38">1:04:38-1:04:41</a>:</strong>  or broader scope of information that we can get faster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:41">1:04:41-1:04:46</a>:</strong>  We also have a deeper understanding and a lot more experience in these different areas,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:46">1:04:46-1:04:48</a>:</strong>  which even then it's just more work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:48">1:04:48-1:04:53</a>:</strong>  So one of my goals and as you might know with United designers, it's to do a lot more team<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:53">1:04:53-1:04:57</a>:</strong>  design, get three or four people on every project that we're doing and then bring in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:04:57">1:04:57-1:05:02</a>:</strong>  other people at the time and those that want to enter and start being designers also bring<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:02">1:05:02-1:05:05</a>:</strong>  them in and say, okay, we start with data mining.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:05">1:05:05-1:05:06</a>:</strong>  Here's the table, go nuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:06">1:05:06-1:05:08</a>:</strong>  Do you have any questions?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:08">1:05:08-1:05:09</a>:</strong>  Let us know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:09">1:05:09-1:05:11</a>:</strong>  But that information is very important to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:11">1:05:11-1:05:16</a>:</strong>  Then if somebody wants to work in Illustrator and start doing base maps, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:16">1:05:16-1:05:18</a>:</strong>  Here's our data mining information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:18">1:05:18-1:05:19</a>:</strong>  Here's our aerials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:19">1:05:19-1:05:22</a>:</strong>  Maybe we went with the drone or had somebody do the drone maps for us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:22">1:05:22-1:05:26</a>:</strong>  Maybe Ben Missimer in Mississippi, one of our partners took all the Dem information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:26">1:05:26-1:05:31</a>:</strong>  from the drones and made us these beautiful topographic maps and all sorts of other things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:31">1:05:31-1:05:34</a>:</strong>  We bring that information and then we hand that off to the second person, say, great,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:34">1:05:34-1:05:36</a>:</strong>  get that base map done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:36">1:05:36-1:05:38</a>:</strong>  We're using, getting their style.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:38">1:05:38-1:05:41</a>:</strong>  And then after that works and all these things start coming in and just like we're doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:41">1:05:41-1:05:43</a>:</strong>  right now, we do zoom meetings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:43">1:05:43-1:05:45</a>:</strong>  And so we're all talking, sharing screens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:45">1:05:45-1:05:47</a>:</strong>  Here's what's going on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:47">1:05:47-1:05:52</a>:</strong>  And let me tell you, having three or four brains on one project is exponentially better<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:52">1:05:52-1:05:54</a>:</strong>  than just this one, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:54">1:05:54-1:05:56</a>:</strong>  It just the stress about it and having to understand all these things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:05:56">1:05:56-1:06:01</a>:</strong>  We need all these people thinking in parallel about the same solution so we can come up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:01">1:06:01-1:06:02</a>:</strong>  with better strategies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:02">1:06:02-1:06:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:03">1:06:03-1:06:08</a>:</strong>  The amount of exchange of ideas and things that you would never have come to or imagined<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:08">1:06:08-1:06:12</a>:</strong>  on your own, I've always found is so much larger and so much worth even some of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:12">1:06:12-1:06:17</a>:</strong>  hassles in interpersonal differences and the struggles of collaboration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:17">1:06:17-1:06:25</a>:</strong>  It's really worth it for that extra mind and expertise that gives perspective on the project<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:25">1:06:25-1:06:31</a>:</strong>  at large, but also the interactions even with clients, aspects on ways to improve the service<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:31">1:06:31-1:06:33</a>:</strong>  is offered and the business aspect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:33">1:06:33-1:06:36</a>:</strong>  It's always worth it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:36">1:06:36-1:06:46</a>:</strong>  How have you sort of put in systems to increase or ensure that communication is maintained,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:46">1:06:46-1:06:52</a>:</strong>  that open and honest communication is facilitated or promoted?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:52">1:06:52-1:06:56</a>:</strong>  Because I've always found in my case that that's where the breakdown can happen in these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:56">1:06:56-1:06:57</a>:</strong>  collaborations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:57">1:06:57-1:06:58</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:58">1:06:58-1:06:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:06:59">1:06:59-1:07:01</a>:</strong>  We have to have a really good understanding with each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:01">1:07:01-1:07:04</a>:</strong>  We do have, we have memorandums of understanding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:04">1:07:04-1:07:08</a>:</strong>  We have the contracts type of situation and our understanding is this is the contract.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:08">1:07:08-1:07:09</a>:</strong>  This is our understanding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:09">1:07:09-1:07:11</a>:</strong>  If it isn't on here, it doesn't exist.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:11">1:07:11-1:07:14</a>:</strong>  So let's make sure we cover our bases on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:14">1:07:14-1:07:17</a>:</strong>  The other agreement we have too, which is kind of a handshake sort of thing is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:17">1:07:17-1:07:20</a>:</strong>  the project is what needs to get done well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:20">1:07:20-1:07:22</a>:</strong>  Let's focus on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:22">1:07:22-1:07:25</a>:</strong>  If we have problems and we're going to have misunderstandings, all of that, but we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:25">1:07:25-1:07:31</a>:</strong>  focusing on doing the project well so we all have a really nice, you know, another feather<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:31">1:07:31-1:07:32</a>:</strong>  in our hat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:32">1:07:32-1:07:35</a>:</strong>  We have a better understanding and the client gets what they need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:35">1:07:35-1:07:38</a>:</strong>  So any kind of misunderstandings, let's put those aside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:38">1:07:38-1:07:39</a>:</strong>  Let's know that they're going to happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:39">1:07:39-1:07:42</a>:</strong>  They're going to happen and then let's do it better next time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:42">1:07:42-1:07:44</a>:</strong>  So communication is really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:44">1:07:44-1:07:47</a>:</strong>  So we have, we have Google docs of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:47">1:07:47-1:07:52</a>:</strong>  So when we're doing our site assessment table, that's in Google word or Google doc, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:52">1:07:52-1:07:53</a>:</strong>  That's on there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:53">1:07:53-1:07:55</a>:</strong>  So you can see what the information is as somebody else or we're all filling it in,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:55">1:07:55-1:07:57</a>:</strong>  which is what I love about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:07:57">1:07:57-1:08:00</a>:</strong>  Our plant lists are on the Google sheets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:00">1:08:00-1:08:03</a>:</strong>  So as we're adding plants, everybody can see that too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:03">1:08:03-1:08:08</a>:</strong>  Then we use Dropbox for all the design work and Dropbox unfortunately you can't work simultaneous<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:08">1:08:08-1:08:15</a>:</strong>  on it yet, but all of the PDF information, all the contracts, all the process sheets,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:15">1:08:15-1:08:18</a>:</strong>  all those things are in folders and ready to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:18">1:08:18-1:08:23</a>:</strong>  So content wise, everybody has access to that in the design team.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:23">1:08:23-1:08:28</a>:</strong>  Then we're doing these zooms and just talking and discussing about a lot of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:28">1:08:28-1:08:32</a>:</strong>  And what really helps with that too is we all have stories that we all have experiences<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:32">1:08:32-1:08:34</a>:</strong>  and that makes it fun, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:34">1:08:34-1:08:37</a>:</strong>  We have anecdotes about, well, I did this here and did this there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:37">1:08:37-1:08:41</a>:</strong>  And the more work that we do, the more stories we can tell is the better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:41">1:08:41-1:08:46</a>:</strong>  But it really is about a team attitude and the fact that we are fallible and we're going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:46">1:08:46-1:08:50</a>:</strong>  to make mistakes and as much as we're trying to keep ego out of this, somebody might feel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:50">1:08:50-1:08:54</a>:</strong>  bad or something didn't get so told well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:54">1:08:54-1:08:58</a>:</strong>  And now when we're working in cross cultures, we have people in Spain or the Netherlands,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:58">1:08:58-1:08:59</a>:</strong>  right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:08:59">1:08:59-1:09:04</a>:</strong>  Or people in South Africa, things get misunderstood and then we have to be very careful how we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:04">1:09:04-1:09:06</a>:</strong>  say things, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:06">1:09:06-1:09:09</a>:</strong>  We have to have the same understanding of what we're talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:09">1:09:09-1:09:14</a>:</strong>  And we have some misunderstandings based on terminology or using colloquialisms that are,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:14">1:09:14-1:09:18</a>:</strong>  you know, phrases that are used in these countries that the other people aren't going to understand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:18">1:09:18-1:09:23</a>:</strong>  So it really is about the client first and this has been just like it was in my other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:23">1:09:23-1:09:24</a>:</strong>  career.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:24">1:09:24-1:09:25</a>:</strong>  It was about the job.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:25">1:09:25-1:09:29</a>:</strong>  We'll argue about things after that's done, but let's just suck it up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:29">1:09:29-1:09:30</a>:</strong>  We need to get this done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:30">1:09:30-1:09:31</a>:</strong>  Sorry about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:31">1:09:31-1:09:35</a>:</strong>  You know, let's move forward and then we'll talk about that and make sure that this doesn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:35">1:09:35-1:09:38</a>:</strong>  happen again because it's always a learning experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:38">1:09:38-1:09:44</a>:</strong>  One of the last things I'll say about that too is the phrase is everybody's got to eat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:44">1:09:44-1:09:46</a>:</strong>  There are no free meal or free jobs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:46">1:09:46-1:09:48</a>:</strong>  There's no free information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:48">1:09:48-1:09:51</a>:</strong>  We have to be very upfront and that's worked out fairly well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:51">1:09:51-1:09:54</a>:</strong>  I'll just say, here's the budget I have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:54">1:09:54-1:09:55</a>:</strong>  Here's how much money I have for you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:55">1:09:55-1:09:57</a>:</strong>  Can you do this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:57">1:09:57-1:09:58</a>:</strong>  Right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:09:58">1:09:58-1:10:06</a>:</strong>  And with Neil or with other people, with Sarah, Ben, Regina, who else is in there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:06">1:10:06-1:10:08</a>:</strong>  Jessica Robertson in Canada, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:08">1:10:08-1:10:09</a>:</strong>  Or Ramees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:09">1:10:09-1:10:13</a>:</strong>  We just say, here's the money I got for this part of the project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:13">1:10:13-1:10:14</a>:</strong>  Are you cool with that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:14">1:10:14-1:10:16</a>:</strong>  And if they say yes, boom, we're done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:16">1:10:16-1:10:19</a>:</strong>  Whatever it takes them to get it done, that's their deal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:19">1:10:19-1:10:20</a>:</strong>  That's not my deal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:20">1:10:20-1:10:24</a>:</strong>  We have just set out what the deliverables are and what the expectation is and they just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:24">1:10:24-1:10:25</a>:</strong>  need to get that done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:25">1:10:25-1:10:30</a>:</strong>  If it takes them eight hours to do it or 18 hours, that's up to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:30">1:10:30-1:10:32</a>:</strong>  And that's, I kind of like that flat fee.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:32">1:10:32-1:10:35</a>:</strong>  So the faster that you get at something, the more money you make.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:35">1:10:35-1:10:37</a>:</strong>  And that's kind of how it would work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:37">1:10:37-1:10:39</a>:</strong>  People want to talk about like hourly wages and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:39">1:10:39-1:10:41</a>:</strong>  I have a real hard time with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:41">1:10:41-1:10:46</a>:</strong>  You know, Ben works really hard on doing the dem files and getting the topography done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:46">1:10:46-1:10:47</a>:</strong>  He's working Illustrator great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:47">1:10:47-1:10:50</a>:</strong>  He does plant symbols for me and all that kind of stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:50">1:10:50-1:10:53</a>:</strong>  And I basically have to say a budget for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:53">1:10:53-1:10:57</a>:</strong>  And if he cranks those out in three or four hours or in an evening, fantastic, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:10:57">1:10:57-1:11:01</a>:</strong>  I still got what I wanted and we negotiated well and understand that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:01">1:11:01-1:11:04</a>:</strong>  So it's the money part is really the hardest part.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:04">1:11:04-1:11:07</a>:</strong>  It's like, it's always the hardest part.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:07">1:11:07-1:11:09</a>:</strong>  Even what we're charging people is hard, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:09">1:11:09-1:11:10</a>:</strong>  And how to make sense of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:10">1:11:10-1:11:13</a>:</strong>  There's no calculation for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:13">1:11:13-1:11:17</a>:</strong>  One hundred and sixty eight or sixty acre project, you know, it might be 15 grand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:17">1:11:17-1:11:19</a>:</strong>  You know, another one might be five.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:19">1:11:19-1:11:20</a>:</strong>  Why?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:20">1:11:20-1:11:23</a>:</strong>  A lot of reasons why there's this huge disparity in size.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:23">1:11:23-1:11:24</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:24">1:11:24-1:11:26</a>:</strong>  But how do you decide what that is?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:26">1:11:26-1:11:27</a>:</strong>  That's different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:27">1:11:27-1:11:31</a>:</strong>  But also I have to say that's why you bring in other people, even when you're doing that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:31">1:11:31-1:11:35</a>:</strong>  start your group early and then use that as a discussion point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:35">1:11:35-1:11:36</a>:</strong>  What should we charge?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:36">1:11:36-1:11:37</a>:</strong>  What do you think we should do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:37">1:11:37-1:11:41</a>:</strong>  And now everybody's on right from the get go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:41">1:11:41-1:11:44</a>:</strong>  I love these observations and I'm learning so much in this process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:44">1:11:44-1:11:49</a>:</strong>  And I'm wondering now if you could give me some direct examples of how these things have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:49">1:11:49-1:11:54</a>:</strong>  sort of played out and some of the overall visions of three of the main organizations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:54">1:11:54-1:11:55</a>:</strong>  that you work with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:11:55">1:11:55-1:12:01</a>:</strong>  And I'm referring to the PRI Cold Climate Institute, the United Designers and Natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:01">1:12:01-1:12:03</a>:</strong>  Capital Plant Database.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:03">1:12:03-1:12:06</a>:</strong>  Let's work through those one by one if you're open to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:06">1:12:06-1:12:11</a>:</strong>  Just starting with the Permaculture Research Institute for Cold Climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:11">1:12:11-1:12:13</a>:</strong>  How did you get started with that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:13">1:12:13-1:12:14</a>:</strong>  Where is it going?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:14">1:12:14-1:12:16</a>:</strong>  And sort of what is that overall vision?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:16">1:12:16-1:12:18</a>:</strong>  What are you trying to accomplish with it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:18">1:12:18-1:12:19</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:19">1:12:19-1:12:22</a>:</strong>  So there's kind of been some transition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:22">1:12:22-1:12:27</a>:</strong>  And as things change, I have found the eco talk about succession.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:27">1:12:27-1:12:32</a>:</strong>  I found that in nonprofit organizations, especially in urban settings where people are involved<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:32">1:12:32-1:12:36</a>:</strong>  with ecological systems, say the garden communities, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:36">1:12:36-1:12:42</a>:</strong>  So if you can remember, and some people might, what life was like in 2000, almost 20 years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:42">1:12:42-1:12:43</a>:</strong>  ago, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:43">1:12:43-1:12:44</a>:</strong>  In 2003.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:44">1:12:44-1:12:46</a>:</strong>  What was going on then?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:46">1:12:46-1:12:48</a>:</strong>  What was happening?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:48">1:12:48-1:12:51</a>:</strong>  Permaculture was barely known, especially in the Twin Cities, like I said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:51">1:12:51-1:12:56</a>:</strong>  But when I was just reading about it and it wasn't until 2003 that I actually met somebody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:56">1:12:56-1:12:58</a>:</strong>  that was thinking the same way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:12:58">1:12:58-1:13:03</a>:</strong>  So PRI, Cold Climate, came out of this, basically this critical mass of people that were bumping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:03">1:13:03-1:13:05</a>:</strong>  into each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:05">1:13:05-1:13:07</a>:</strong>  And then all of a sudden said, let's get organized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:07">1:13:07-1:13:08</a>:</strong>  Let's start doing this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:08">1:13:08-1:13:13</a>:</strong>  And it went from five to six to 12 to 24 to then 80 people over the years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:13">1:13:13-1:13:19</a>:</strong>  So that was the inception of permaculture in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, the Twin<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:19">1:13:19-1:13:20</a>:</strong>  Cities area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:20">1:13:20-1:13:22</a>:</strong>  And it grew and it grew and it grew.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:22">1:13:22-1:13:23</a>:</strong>  And it did a lot of training.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:23">1:13:23-1:13:24</a>:</strong>  It did a lot of classes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:24">1:13:24-1:13:26</a>:</strong>  It was about the only organization doing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:26">1:13:26-1:13:32</a>:</strong>  Well, just imagine after 10 years of training all these people and doing all these classes,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:32">1:13:32-1:13:36</a>:</strong>  all these offshoots and other organizations that would start up, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:36">1:13:36-1:13:37</a>:</strong>  People would leave.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:37">1:13:37-1:13:38</a>:</strong>  They're working for schools.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:38">1:13:38-1:13:41</a>:</strong>  They're working for other nonprofit, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:41">1:13:41-1:13:44</a>:</strong>  There was another organization called Gardening Matters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:44">1:13:44-1:13:48</a>:</strong>  Started way, way back when there wasn't a lot of community gardening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:48">1:13:48-1:13:49</a>:</strong>  It wasn't organized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:49">1:13:49-1:13:51</a>:</strong>  And they were like the big dog.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:51">1:13:51-1:13:53</a>:</strong>  They were getting everybody organized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:53">1:13:53-1:13:54</a>:</strong>  They had the funding coming in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:54">1:13:54-1:13:58</a>:</strong>  And they got a huge number of community gardens started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:13:58">1:13:58-1:14:03</a>:</strong>  At the same time, schools and community gardens started also teaching this at the same time,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:03">1:14:03-1:14:04</a>:</strong>  right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:04">1:14:04-1:14:10</a>:</strong>  So the problem kind of comes in then is after a while, pure cold climate has now created<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:10">1:14:10-1:14:12</a>:</strong>  its own competition, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:12">1:14:12-1:14:17</a>:</strong>  It's actually fulfilled its destiny of what it was trying to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:17">1:14:17-1:14:24</a>:</strong>  And in some way, every nonprofit's goal should be to become obsolete, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:24">1:14:24-1:14:28</a>:</strong>  If you have an action that you're trying to take and you're trying to fix the world or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:28">1:14:28-1:14:31</a>:</strong>  you're trying to do something and make it happen, well, sooner or later, I would think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:31">1:14:31-1:14:33</a>:</strong>  it does happen and you're not needed anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:33">1:14:33-1:14:34</a>:</strong>  You've been successful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:34">1:14:34-1:14:35</a>:</strong>  Ideally, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:35">1:14:35-1:14:36</a>:</strong>  Ideally, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:36">1:14:36-1:14:38</a>:</strong>  Otherwise, you're not being very effective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:38">1:14:38-1:14:39</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:39">1:14:39-1:14:41</a>:</strong>  So all these people, we had 80 members.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:41">1:14:41-1:14:46</a>:</strong>  We did 24 people in the PDC, all these people going out and everybody, what's amazing with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:46">1:14:46-1:14:51</a>:</strong>  PRI cold climate that people started getting busy and doing their work and basically spread<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:51">1:14:51-1:14:52</a>:</strong>  out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:52">1:14:52-1:14:57</a>:</strong>  So PRI cold climate now has kind of taken a hiatus and people are off doing the work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:14:57">1:14:57-1:15:01</a>:</strong>  They're doing a lot less education, a lot less programs because all these people are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:01">1:15:01-1:15:02</a>:</strong>  best like myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:02">1:15:02-1:15:04</a>:</strong>  I'm just off doing other things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:04">1:15:04-1:15:09</a>:</strong>  Now, what that did move into, I have personally transitioned to was PRI USA.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:09">1:15:09-1:15:16</a>:</strong>  So PRI USA is the national organization, Permaculture Research Institute here and Neil's in that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:16">1:15:16-1:15:18</a>:</strong>  Ramez, Owen HaBudzil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:18">1:15:18-1:15:20</a>:</strong>  And so we're the directors of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:20">1:15:20-1:15:25</a>:</strong>  So that's more of a national nonprofit organization that I'm helping run to and kind of PRI cold<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:25">1:15:25-1:15:29</a>:</strong>  climate, it's kind of left that and basically it's just sitting there waiting for who knows<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:29">1:15:29-1:15:30</a>:</strong>  something to happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:30">1:15:30-1:15:31</a>:</strong>  It actually is fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:31">1:15:31-1:15:35</a>:</strong>  There's a lot, there's like three or four other organizations now doing PDCs that kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:35">1:15:35-1:15:39</a>:</strong>  of came from that organization and that's kind of the natural progression with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:39">1:15:39-1:15:45</a>:</strong>  So PRI USA, we are a nonprofit organization and we're asking a fiscal agent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:45">1:15:45-1:15:49</a>:</strong>  So if people want to start projects, start Permaculture, Food Force, whatever it might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:49">1:15:49-1:15:55</a>:</strong>  be, we act as a fiscal agent so that their donors could donate the money to us as a nonprofit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:55">1:15:55-1:15:59</a>:</strong>  and then we fund the profit so that their donors get the tax write off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:15:59">1:15:59-1:16:00</a>:</strong>  That's what that's all about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:00">1:16:00-1:16:03</a>:</strong>  And then the people put in the project, they never touch the money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:03">1:16:03-1:16:04</a>:</strong>  They don't have to pay the taxes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:04">1:16:04-1:16:06</a>:</strong>  We do all of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:06">1:16:06-1:16:07</a>:</strong>  We do all the accounting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:07">1:16:07-1:16:11</a>:</strong>  So the project gets done, but the donors get a tax write off and the project people get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:11">1:16:11-1:16:14</a>:</strong>  the funds that they need in order to get that done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:14">1:16:14-1:16:15</a>:</strong>  That is very important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:15">1:16:15-1:16:20</a>:</strong>  Now, let's move to United Designers, which is a for profit enterprise and is a collection<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:20">1:16:20-1:16:22</a>:</strong>  of designers located all over the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:22">1:16:22-1:16:26</a>:</strong>  You've talked a lot about some of the projects that you all have done together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:26">1:16:26-1:16:29</a>:</strong>  Tell me how that vision came together and where you're at currently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:29">1:16:29-1:16:30</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:30">1:16:30-1:16:35</a>:</strong>  So there was a conversation I was having with somebody, gee, it might have been four or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:35">1:16:35-1:16:40</a>:</strong>  five years ago about something that was missing in Permaculture and kind of an underlying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:40">1:16:40-1:16:42</a>:</strong>  tone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:42">1:16:42-1:16:48</a>:</strong>  There are a lot of classes, courses, PDC, and the underlying tone of Permaculture a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:48">1:16:48-1:16:51</a>:</strong>  lot has been about the independent person, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:51">1:16:51-1:16:55</a>:</strong>  The homesteader, the person going out and being self sufficient and all of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:55">1:16:55-1:16:57</a>:</strong>  There wasn't a lot of teamwork, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:16:57">1:16:57-1:17:02</a>:</strong>  There's social permaculture and there's economics and things like that, but basically it wasn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:02">1:17:02-1:17:05</a>:</strong>  a lot about working together as a team.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:05">1:17:05-1:17:09</a>:</strong>  And so after people were doing their PDCs and after people were getting out, it was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:09">1:17:09-1:17:11</a>:</strong>  like, how can we get people working together as teams?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:11">1:17:11-1:17:17</a>:</strong>  And then get their work done and learn from each other and come together and do better<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:17">1:17:17-1:17:18</a>:</strong>  work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:18">1:17:18-1:17:22</a>:</strong>  And so the idea with United designers right from the beginning was let's, every time there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:22">1:17:22-1:17:26</a>:</strong>  a project, let's bring in at least one to two other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:26">1:17:26-1:17:27</a>:</strong>  And I've been trying to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:27">1:17:27-1:17:31</a>:</strong>  Every time I get a job, I need to bring at least one to two other people to help me with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:31">1:17:31-1:17:35</a>:</strong>  it and then they will also, and we'll work with each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:35">1:17:35-1:17:39</a>:</strong>  So the way United designers started was I'm getting projects because it basically is my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:39">1:17:39-1:17:44</a>:</strong>  idea and I got to like model it of course, is getting the projects and then finding people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:44">1:17:44-1:17:48</a>:</strong>  that can work with me on that and then they will also hire me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:48">1:17:48-1:17:53</a>:</strong>  So the only way to be part of United designers to actually have the job, but the jobs and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:53">1:17:53-1:17:56</a>:</strong>  the paying projects are what fund the education.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:56">1:17:56-1:17:59</a>:</strong>  And that's what I think is a new model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:17:59">1:17:59-1:18:04</a>:</strong>  Learning permaculture, do the PDC, marketing it out there, getting a project, but then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:04">1:18:04-1:18:05</a>:</strong>  understanding that guess what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:05">1:18:05-1:18:06</a>:</strong>  It's not all about you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:06">1:18:06-1:18:09</a>:</strong>  You don't have to do this by yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:09">1:18:09-1:18:14</a>:</strong>  The next level of your permaculture education, design education is going to be a real income<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:14">1:18:14-1:18:19</a>:</strong>  generating opportunity that you can use to bring yourself to a higher level by working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:19">1:18:19-1:18:22</a>:</strong>  with all these other people that are already doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:22">1:18:22-1:18:24</a>:</strong>  So that's how United designers work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:24">1:18:24-1:18:28</a>:</strong>  Either we hire you because you have a specialty or you hire us because you're looking for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:28">1:18:28-1:18:30</a>:</strong>  help getting the work done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:30">1:18:30-1:18:34</a>:</strong>  As soon as either one of those happen, you're in and you're basically staff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:34">1:18:34-1:18:36</a>:</strong>  You're part of United designers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:36">1:18:36-1:18:37</a>:</strong>  It's not a club.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:37">1:18:37-1:18:40</a>:</strong>  There's no member fit ship fees, any things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:40">1:18:40-1:18:42</a>:</strong>  It's all based on actual work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:42">1:18:42-1:18:45</a>:</strong>  And part of that is like a phrase I have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:45">1:18:45-1:18:48</a>:</strong>  If you don't have any skin in the game, it's not going to work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:48">1:18:48-1:18:50</a>:</strong>  Everybody has to have a risk involved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:50">1:18:50-1:18:54</a>:</strong>  Everybody has to have the reputation on the line in order to make this work seriously<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:54">1:18:54-1:18:56</a>:</strong>  and know that it needs to be done well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:56">1:18:56-1:18:58</a>:</strong>  Then all of our best work comes from that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:18:58">1:18:58-1:19:05</a>:</strong>  So it's about working as a team and then having our education funded by actual real projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:05">1:19:05-1:19:09</a>:</strong>  I really like the motivation for that and how you've structured it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:09">1:19:09-1:19:10</a>:</strong>  I find really inspiring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:10">1:19:10-1:19:15</a>:</strong>  Now before we go too long on that one, can you talk about the natural capital plant database,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:15">1:19:15-1:19:19</a>:</strong>  how that came about and what you aim to achieve with that organization?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:19">1:19:19-1:19:20</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:20">1:19:20-1:19:27</a>:</strong>  So I talked about Paula Westmoreland, who was my mentor, first person I met in permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:27">1:19:27-1:19:32</a>:</strong>  So about that same time, she was a programmer, a computer programmer, I think, a designer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:32">1:19:32-1:19:33</a>:</strong>  at that time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:33">1:19:33-1:19:37</a>:</strong>  She was in permaculture in 1999, was working on doing her own landscape company.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:37">1:19:37-1:19:42</a>:</strong>  And she found that these plant databases that were out there for landscape did not have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:42">1:19:42-1:19:45</a>:</strong>  enough information for the ecological type of design work we wanted to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:45">1:19:45-1:19:50</a>:</strong>  It was all about aesthetics, color, height, texture, those kinds of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:50">1:19:50-1:19:54</a>:</strong>  Where they would grow, all was great, but there was nothing in there for ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:54">1:19:54-1:19:57</a>:</strong>  function because permaculture is about guilds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:19:57">1:19:57-1:20:00</a>:</strong>  It's about things working together, polycultures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:00">1:20:00-1:20:02</a>:</strong>  None of that existed in these databases.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:02">1:20:02-1:20:07</a>:</strong>  So she got a grant and she got a bunch of people together and decided we need to take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:07">1:20:07-1:20:11</a>:</strong>  all this information and rebuild it as a plant database.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:11">1:20:11-1:20:15</a>:</strong>  And so, she did actually, and then people from the PRI Co-Climate got together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:15">1:20:15-1:20:21</a>:</strong>  It's about 12 people doing information data collection, putting this together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:21">1:20:21-1:20:26</a>:</strong>  Basically I think it was in Excel and then it went into Access and then it went into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:26">1:20:26-1:20:30</a>:</strong>  some relational database software online in order to make it work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:30">1:20:30-1:20:34</a>:</strong>  It was in Wiki, I think, the first iteration of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:34">1:20:34-1:20:38</a>:</strong>  And so we had a web developer that put this together and all this information and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:38">1:20:38-1:20:41</a>:</strong>  got in the first set of plants was 1300 plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:41">1:20:41-1:20:45</a>:</strong>  Mostly with the upper Midwest, mostly from local.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:45">1:20:45-1:20:49</a>:</strong>  But you could put in your information and if I could share a screen with you, would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:49">1:20:49-1:20:50</a>:</strong>  that be okay?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:50">1:20:50-1:20:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah, go ahead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:51">1:20:51-1:20:52</a>:</strong>  Let's see if that works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:52">1:20:52-1:20:53</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:53">1:20:53-1:20:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's a good way of putting it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:55">1:20:55-1:20:57</a>:</strong>  Let's see if that works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:20:57">1:20:57-1:21:01</a>:</strong>  I'm going to open this and come to here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:01">1:21:01-1:21:02</a>:</strong>  Here we are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:02">1:21:02-1:21:03</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:03">1:21:03-1:21:04</a>:</strong>  You see that okay?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:04">1:21:04-1:21:05</a>:</strong>  Yep, I can see it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:05">1:21:05-1:21:08</a>:</strong>  Now, unfortunately, because this is over the audio, I'm not going to be able to share this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:08">1:21:08-1:21:14</a>:</strong>  during the podcast, but I will clip this video and include it in the show notes on the website<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:14">1:21:14-1:21:15</a>:</strong>  below this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:15">1:21:15-1:21:19</a>:</strong>  So anybody who's listening right now, you can log into abundantedge.com, find the episode<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:19">1:21:19-1:21:23</a>:</strong>  and find this at the bottom of that page for those of you who want to see what Dan was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:23">1:21:23-1:21:24</a>:</strong>  just explaining.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:24">1:21:24-1:21:25</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:25">1:21:25-1:21:27</a>:</strong>  So this is the Natural Capital Plant Database.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:27">1:21:27-1:21:33</a>:</strong>  I've already signed in and there's information about permaculture, polyculture designs, about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:33">1:21:33-1:21:39</a>:</strong>  pollen myself and how it started, membership levels that we have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:39">1:21:39-1:21:42</a>:</strong>  But the great information is the database.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:42">1:21:42-1:21:48</a>:</strong>  We have almost 2,400 plants now, so almost a thousand more than we had some years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:48">1:21:48-1:21:55</a>:</strong>  And everything in here is ordered by a common name for us, but the scientific name is what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:55">1:21:55-1:21:57</a>:</strong>  pretty much everybody goes by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:21:57">1:21:57-1:22:01</a>:</strong>  So each plant has a data table.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:01">1:22:01-1:22:04</a>:</strong>  So in this case, you see the list, there's natural plants associates, so those are plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:04">1:22:04-1:22:05</a>:</strong>  that grow together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:05">1:22:05-1:22:10</a>:</strong>  And if they go down there to alder, there are 19 different polycultures that green alder<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:10">1:22:10-1:22:11</a>:</strong>  is part of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:11">1:22:11-1:22:14</a>:</strong>  And I believe that's a nitrogen fixer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:14">1:22:14-1:22:18</a>:</strong>  So if I click on one of these, like cat claw acacia, this is the information that Paula<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:18">1:22:18-1:22:23</a>:</strong>  was going for and then we've expanded on over the years to give people what they need to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:23">1:22:23-1:22:24</a>:</strong>  know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:24">1:22:24-1:22:28</a>:</strong>  So at the top of this page, you'll see all the plant detail.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:28">1:22:28-1:22:33</a>:</strong>  The name, scientific name, all that kind of information, characteristics, the size, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:33">1:22:33-1:22:38</a>:</strong>  soil type that it needs, moisture, root type, depth, all those kind, every kind of information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:38">1:22:38-1:22:41</a>:</strong>  we can find about the plant's characteristics, we put it there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:41">1:22:41-1:22:48</a>:</strong>  Then we have the tolerances, what kind of zones, soil pH it needs, drought, flood, salt,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:48">1:22:48-1:22:50</a>:</strong>  soil compaction, all those things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:50">1:22:50-1:22:52</a>:</strong>  And then the behaviors, growing seasons, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:52">1:22:52-1:22:56</a>:</strong>  All the information that we want to know about a plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:56">1:22:56-1:22:59</a>:</strong>  But even more than that, what are all the human uses?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:22:59">1:22:59-1:23:01</a>:</strong>  So cat claw acacia is pretty great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:01">1:23:01-1:23:02</a>:</strong>  It's a dry land plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:02">1:23:02-1:23:05</a>:</strong>  It's kind of a desert plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:05">1:23:05-1:23:08</a>:</strong>  But all the human uses, but then the ecological functions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:08">1:23:08-1:23:13</a>:</strong>  And that's the thing that we are going for on the plant database is so you can search<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:13">1:23:13-1:23:16</a>:</strong>  the database for all the nitrogen fixers as this is one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:16">1:23:16-1:23:20</a>:</strong>  Maybe you need domestic animal forage, or maybe you need wildlife habitat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:20">1:23:20-1:23:26</a>:</strong>  You can go to the search page, put in your growing zone, your soil type, any kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:26">1:23:26-1:23:30</a>:</strong>  sunlight restrictions there might be on there, if it floods once in a while, whatever that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:30">1:23:30-1:23:35</a>:</strong>  is, and then click on you want all the wildlife habitat plants, and it will give you a list<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:35">1:23:35-1:23:36</a>:</strong>  that has that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:36">1:23:36-1:23:39</a>:</strong>  And so this is what the plant database does.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:39">1:23:39-1:23:40</a>:</strong>  This is what I work with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:40">1:23:40-1:23:43</a>:</strong>  This is what all our subscribers work with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:43">1:23:43-1:23:47</a>:</strong>  We have 5,000 users in 70 countries, actually over 5,000.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:47">1:23:47-1:23:50</a>:</strong>  We have about 600 paid users.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:50">1:23:50-1:23:56</a>:</strong>  All this information is free unless you want to do basically a search for plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:23:56">1:23:56-1:24:00</a>:</strong>  And that's $30 a year right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:00">1:24:00-1:24:01</a>:</strong>  And this is the page for doing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:01">1:24:01-1:24:03</a>:</strong>  It's very simple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:03">1:24:03-1:24:06</a>:</strong>  If you want to just go by plant type, you can do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:06">1:24:06-1:24:12</a>:</strong>  Otherwise put in your growing zone, the pH, and then your soil types, and any other information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:12">1:24:12-1:24:17</a>:</strong>  if it's a droughty area, if it's animal resistance you're looking for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:17">1:24:17-1:24:20</a>:</strong>  And just like in permaculture, if we want to partition the soil, maybe I'm just looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:20">1:24:20-1:24:22</a>:</strong>  for taproot plants, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:22">1:24:22-1:24:27</a>:</strong>  Maybe I'm looking for tubers or fibrous deep-rooted plants or fibrous shallow plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:27">1:24:27-1:24:29</a>:</strong>  You can also do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:29">1:24:29-1:24:32</a>:</strong>  Sometimes when we're working with windbreak, we need fast-growing trees, so I will use<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:32">1:24:32-1:24:35</a>:</strong>  that sort of growth rate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:35">1:24:35-1:24:38</a>:</strong>  But you can put that information in the top, then come to the bottom and say, I just want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:38">1:24:38-1:24:44</a>:</strong>  all the food plants that have my growing zone and my ecological conditions, and you'll get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:44">1:24:44-1:24:48</a>:</strong>  all the plants that you can eat that will come with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:48">1:24:48-1:24:51</a>:</strong>  Or I'll turn that off and I'll go over here and click on nitrogen fixers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:51">1:24:51-1:24:55</a>:</strong>  I want all the nitrogen fixers, and then I'll get that list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:24:55">1:24:55-1:25:01</a>:</strong>  And then once you get the list, maybe I'll try to do one here real quick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:01">1:25:01-1:25:03</a>:</strong>  So make it a little more difficult.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:03">1:25:03-1:25:12</a>:</strong>  I have sandy, loamy soil, full sun, and I just want all the nitrogen fixers for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:12">1:25:12-1:25:15</a>:</strong>  I'm not going to pick, you can also go by family if you know what family you're looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:15">1:25:15-1:25:17</a>:</strong>  for plants, or if you just want plant type.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:17">1:25:17-1:25:22</a>:</strong>  If the list is too long, you kind of have to do a limited a little more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:22">1:25:22-1:25:23</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:23">1:25:23-1:25:29</a>:</strong>  I have 33 nitrogen fixing plants that I can use in this ecological state.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:29">1:25:29-1:25:31</a>:</strong>  Pretty good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:31">1:25:31-1:25:33</a>:</strong>  Many of these might be native.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:33">1:25:33-1:25:37</a>:</strong>  Many of these might be something that's been naturalized, but there's a lot of ways to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:37">1:25:37-1:25:38</a>:</strong>  work with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:38">1:25:38-1:25:39</a>:</strong>  So fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:39">1:25:39-1:25:40</a>:</strong>  I really appreciate that explanation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:40">1:25:40-1:25:45</a>:</strong>  It really kind of illuminated what you've been working on and how these different structures<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:45">1:25:45-1:25:48</a>:</strong>  have been put together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:48">1:25:48-1:25:53</a>:</strong>  Before I let you go, can you tell us a little bit about how our listeners can get in touch<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:53">1:25:53-1:25:59</a>:</strong>  with you, the various organizations that you just mentioned and any courses or services<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:25:59">1:25:59-1:26:02</a>:</strong>  that you'd like to educate them about?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:02">1:26:02-1:26:03</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:03">1:26:03-1:26:07</a>:</strong>  So my main website is southwoodscenter.com.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:07">1:26:07-1:26:08</a>:</strong>  That's where all my design work is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:08">1:26:08-1:26:12</a>:</strong>  You can see a lot of the work that I've done in the past.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:12">1:26:12-1:26:19</a>:</strong>  Halsey1.com, H-A-L-S-E, the numeral one dot com, is our new education website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:19">1:26:19-1:26:24</a>:</strong>  And that's where you can find information on advanced permaculture, where we have technical<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:24">1:26:24-1:26:25</a>:</strong>  drawing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:25">1:26:25-1:26:29</a>:</strong>  That's actually the drafting table type permaculture drawing advanced that I've done for about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:29">1:26:29-1:26:31</a>:</strong>  nine years teaching that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:31">1:26:31-1:26:36</a>:</strong>  And then we also have a course coming up in July for Adobe Illustrator for ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:36">1:26:36-1:26:37</a>:</strong>  design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:37">1:26:37-1:26:38</a>:</strong>  And that's also five days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:38">1:26:38-1:26:42</a>:</strong>  I've taught that a number of times actually in the Netherlands and the US a number of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:42">1:26:42-1:26:45</a>:</strong>  times in different areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:45">1:26:45-1:26:51</a>:</strong>  And that's basically taking our advanced technical drawing and now converting all that process<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:51">1:26:51-1:26:55</a>:</strong>  but understanding how to do it in Adobe Illustrator.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:55">1:26:55-1:26:56</a>:</strong>  And we have found that platform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:56">1:26:56-1:26:57</a>:</strong>  Some people use SketchUp.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:57">1:26:57-1:26:59</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of different software programs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:26:59">1:26:59-1:27:04</a>:</strong>  We have found, and I have to say everybody that's taken the class, and you might see<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:04">1:27:04-1:27:08</a>:</strong>  a lot of people on Facebook too that have been using it, taught themselves or used my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:08">1:27:08-1:27:10</a>:</strong>  system to learn how to use it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:10">1:27:10-1:27:14</a>:</strong>  They are all very happy with the quality of the work that you can do with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:14">1:27:14-1:27:15</a>:</strong>  Makes it so much easier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:15">1:27:15-1:27:21</a>:</strong>  It's a very powerful program but it also makes it much easier to do the work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:21">1:27:21-1:27:24</a>:</strong>  And also now we have libraries of information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:24">1:27:24-1:27:27</a>:</strong>  So we're all using that same, talk about standardization.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:27">1:27:27-1:27:31</a>:</strong>  If we're all using Adobe Illustrator and saving all those symbols and plant symbols, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:31">1:27:31-1:27:32</a>:</strong>  Now that's where we're building a library.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:32">1:27:32-1:27:33</a>:</strong>  Ah, you get the groundswell.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:33">1:27:33-1:27:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah, everybody can tap into that database.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:35">1:27:35-1:27:36</a>:</strong>  That's very powerful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:36">1:27:36-1:27:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:37">1:27:37-1:27:39</a>:</strong>  So we have hundreds and hundreds of plants now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:39">1:27:39-1:27:44</a>:</strong>  Plant symbols, even symbols for different cars and tractors, buildings, things like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:44">1:27:44-1:27:45</a>:</strong>  that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:45">1:27:45-1:27:46</a>:</strong>  It makes it easier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:46">1:27:46-1:27:48</a>:</strong>  So we have our standardized templates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:48">1:27:48-1:27:50</a>:</strong>  So it's already done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:50">1:27:50-1:27:53</a>:</strong>  Our sector maps, we have a number of those and different styles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:53">1:27:53-1:27:58</a>:</strong>  But the templates and the symbols just make it easier to work and faster to work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:27:58">1:27:58-1:28:02</a>:</strong>  And now we have this kind of a standardized brand, you might say, of how the information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:02">1:28:02-1:28:03</a>:</strong>  is displayed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:03">1:28:03-1:28:04</a>:</strong>  And people really like it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:04">1:28:04-1:28:07</a>:</strong>  It really improves the communication.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:07">1:28:07-1:28:08</a>:</strong>  I have no doubt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:08">1:28:08-1:28:12</a>:</strong>  I think those things are extremely important to get out to more designers out there because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:12">1:28:12-1:28:14</a>:</strong>  these tools, like you said, are extremely powerful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:14">1:28:14-1:28:19</a>:</strong>  And the potential for collaboration I see as one of the biggest advantages of all getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:19">1:28:19-1:28:21</a>:</strong>  on these similar systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:21">1:28:21-1:28:24</a>:</strong>  Dan, it's been an absolute pleasure talking to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:24">1:28:24-1:28:27</a>:</strong>  More than anything, I'm really looking forward to connecting with you in a couple of weeks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:27">1:28:27-1:28:30</a>:</strong>  when I get back to Minnesota.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:30">1:28:30-1:28:33</a>:</strong>  The funny thing about this is I've been following your work for years and I've been living away<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:33">1:28:33-1:28:36</a>:</strong>  from where I grew up for such a long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:36">1:28:36-1:28:40</a>:</strong>  It's going to be really fun to come full circle and actually visit some of the systems that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:40">1:28:40-1:28:42</a>:</strong>  you're working on there and be able to connect in person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:42">1:28:42-1:28:44</a>:</strong>  Well, that'd be great, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:44">1:28:44-1:28:46</a>:</strong>  I really hope to see you here on your trip.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:46">1:28:46-1:28:50</a>:</strong>  And we could do a little tour of the farm and look at other things that are going on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:50">1:28:50-1:28:54</a>:</strong>  And I really appreciate this time and talking to you and having this conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:54">1:28:54-1:28:55</a>:</strong>  Oh, the pleasure is all mine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:55">1:28:55-1:28:59</a>:</strong>  And for those of you listening, definitely look out in the future for videos we might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:28:59">1:28:59-1:29:03</a>:</strong>  be able to make with each other when I go to visit Dan and his systems out in Minnesota<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:03">1:29:03-1:29:04</a>:</strong>  soon too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:04">1:29:04-1:29:07</a>:</strong>  So, yeah, again, thanks so much for taking the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:07">1:29:07-1:29:08</a>:</strong>  Let's stay in touch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:08">1:29:08-1:29:12</a>:</strong>  And I really hope that perhaps we can even do a follow up interview in the future as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:12">1:29:12-1:29:14</a>:</strong>  more of these things continue to develop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-daniel-halsey/#t=1:29:14">1:29:14-1:29:18</a>:</strong>  I'm really watching these with a lot of hope and expectation.<br />
