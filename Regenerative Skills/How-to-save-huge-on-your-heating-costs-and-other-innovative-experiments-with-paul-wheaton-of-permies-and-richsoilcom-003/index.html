<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:12">0:00:12-0:00:18</a>:</strong>  Many of you probably know Paul Wheaton already as the founder of Permies and Richsoil.com<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:18">0:00:18-0:00:23</a>:</strong>  or from his TED Talk on how to save energy by heating your home in alternative ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:23">0:00:23-0:00:28</a>:</strong>  He's a giant who always wears overalls and is being called the Duke of Permaculture by<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:28">0:00:28-0:00:34</a>:</strong>  Jeff Lawton, the bad boy of permaculture, and has a lot of other nicknames as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:34">0:00:34-0:00:38</a>:</strong>  He started out as a software engineer best known for working on the ground systems for<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:42">0:00:42-0:00:48</a>:</strong>  He's currently the largest voice for permaculture in the world with the forums on Permies.com<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:51">0:00:51-0:00:57</a>:</strong>  We get into a ton of great topics in this interview, including rocket mass heaters,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:00:57">0:00:57-0:01:02</a>:</strong>  a ton of creative ways to save energy from heating your home, and some of his more controversial<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:06">0:01:06-0:01:09</a>:</strong>  Now a quick disclaimer before we get started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:09">0:01:09-0:01:13</a>:</strong>  My internet connection here in rural Guatemala still is not the best, so there might be a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:13">0:01:13-0:01:19</a>:</strong>  few times in the interview where the quality falls off, there's a little bit of distortion,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:19">0:01:19-0:01:23</a>:</strong>  but I promise you if you keep listening there won't be any problems with understanding what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:23">0:01:23-0:01:24</a>:</strong>  he's trying to say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:24">0:01:24-0:01:29</a>:</strong>  So stick with me, bear with me while I get my equipment and my connection fixed up a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:29">0:01:29-0:01:32</a>:</strong>  little bit here, and let's get started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:32">0:01:32-0:01:44</a>:</strong>  Welcome Paul, thanks for being with me here today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:44">0:01:44-0:01:46</a>:</strong>  How you doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:46">0:01:46-0:01:49</a>:</strong>  Hey, I've got a cold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:49">0:01:49-0:01:51</a>:</strong>  I plan on coughing through this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:51">0:01:51-0:01:52</a>:</strong>  Oh right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:52">0:01:52-0:01:56</a>:</strong>  There's no way I'm going to edit that out, so let's keep doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:56">0:01:56-0:01:58</a>:</strong>  All right, jumping right in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:01:58">0:01:58-0:02:03</a>:</strong>  You have developed a very robust reputation in both the natural building and permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:03">0:02:03-0:02:08</a>:</strong>  communities for some bold ideas that have challenged what many of us are taught about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:08">0:02:08-0:02:12</a>:</strong>  energy saving, gardening, indoor heating and more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:16</a>:</strong>  What have been your most important experiments so far?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:16">0:02:16-0:02:19</a>:</strong>  My most important experiments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:19">0:02:19-0:02:26</a>:</strong>  You know, this is going to sound like probably the dumbest experiment from the world of natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:26">0:02:26-0:02:32</a>:</strong>  building, permaculture and all the other things, and I did something a few years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:32">0:02:32-0:02:38</a>:</strong>  I happened to be in a scenario where I had electric heat, and I had a really hard time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:38">0:02:38-0:02:43</a>:</strong>  convincing people of how heat works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:43">0:02:43-0:02:51</a>:</strong>  And I did what I think was a ridiculously simple thing, and I've made videos of it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:51">0:02:51-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  and all kinds of articles and charts and proofs, and I called the article, How I Cut 87% Off<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:05</a>:</strong>  of My Electric Heat Bill, and the thing that makes it so important is that I can't get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:05">0:03:05-0:03:07</a>:</strong>  anybody to believe it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:07">0:03:07-0:03:11</a>:</strong>  And it's like such a simple thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:11">0:03:11-0:03:18</a>:</strong>  In fact, the knowledge that it is true sits in your head right now, and all the people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:18">0:03:18-0:03:24</a>:</strong>  who don't believe it, the knowledge that it's true is already in their head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:24">0:03:24-0:03:27</a>:</strong>  And so let me turn the tables on you for just a second.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:27">0:03:27-0:03:28</a>:</strong>  I'm going to ask you a question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:28">0:03:28-0:03:34</a>:</strong>  Why is an efficient light inefficient?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:34">0:03:34-0:03:35</a>:</strong>  Why is it inefficient?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:35">0:03:35-0:03:39</a>:</strong>  Because it converts so much of its energy into heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:39">0:03:39-0:03:41</a>:</strong>  Into heat?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:41">0:03:41-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  You don't say!<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:44</a>:</strong>  Into heat, really?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:44">0:03:44-0:03:47</a>:</strong>  And now there are three kinds of heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:47">0:03:47-0:03:52</a>:</strong>  Do you know the three kinds of heat?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:52">0:03:52-0:03:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah, convection, conduction, and I always forget the third C.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:03:59">0:03:59-0:04:00</a>:</strong>  Radiant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:00">0:04:00-0:04:02</a>:</strong>  What's the one?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:02">0:04:02-0:04:03</a>:</strong>  Radiant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:03">0:04:03-0:04:04</a>:</strong>  Radiant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:06</a>:</strong>  It's that C that is missing the bottom half.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:06">0:04:06-0:04:08</a>:</strong>  That's what it was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:08">0:04:08-0:04:10</a>:</strong>  I was thinking of the wrong letter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:10">0:04:10-0:04:11</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:11">0:04:11-0:04:16</a>:</strong>  So the thing is, is that convective heat is the least efficient form of heat, but it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:16">0:04:16-0:04:19</a>:</strong>  also the kind of heat that most American homes use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:19">0:04:19-0:04:20</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:20">0:04:20-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  Heat all the air in the house and hope that it gets to some of the people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:24">0:04:24-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  And then the light bulb uses radiant heat, which is a pretty efficient form of heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:37</a>:</strong>  And if you use it really in a very smart fashion, you'll heat people more than you'll heat all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:37">0:04:37-0:04:41</a>:</strong>  this space in your home that no one's currently occupying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:41">0:04:41-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  It takes a little bit of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:04:47</a>:</strong>  You've got to kind of audit where you're spending most of the time in your home so that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:04:51</a>:</strong>  can direct that heat to where you're going to be, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:51">0:04:51-0:04:52</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:52">0:04:52-0:04:53</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:53">0:04:53-0:04:57</a>:</strong>  Now, of course, you move the light close to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:04:57">0:04:57-0:05:03</a>:</strong>  You have it directed, you know, more of a directional light bulb than a general lighting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:04</a>:</strong>  kind of a thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:04">0:05:04-0:05:08</a>:</strong>  And you direct it at people, things of that nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:08">0:05:08-0:05:15</a>:</strong>  But the bottom line is, is that even if you're absolutely terrible at doing any of that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:15">0:05:15-0:05:22</a>:</strong>  for whatever reason, then the amount of heat in your home, like if you're using electric<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:22">0:05:22-0:05:30</a>:</strong>  heat, it's like if it's the middle of winter, let's say it's 20 degrees outside, and you've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:30">0:05:30-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  got baseboard heats going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:38</a>:</strong>  If you turn on 40 light bulbs in your house, and they don't add up to the amount of electricity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:38">0:05:38-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  being used by your baseboard heat, which, by the way, is going to be warmer, then you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:50</a>:</strong>  still going to be, like the amount of time that the baseboard heat comes on now is going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:50">0:05:50-0:05:54</a>:</strong>  to be a lot less because of all the heat given off by those light bulbs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:54">0:05:54-0:05:56</a>:</strong>  The thermostat isn't going to trip as much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:56">0:05:56-0:05:57</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:05:57">0:05:57-0:06:01</a>:</strong>  It's almost, you know, if you're using the light bulbs, if all the light bulbs are behind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:01">0:06:01-0:06:06</a>:</strong>  some sort of block, then the amount of heat that they contribute to the space is going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:06">0:06:06-0:06:08</a>:</strong>  to be precisely the same.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:08">0:06:08-0:06:14</a>:</strong>  But if you allow them to do the radiant heat thing, then the thermostat will be set for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:14">0:06:14-0:06:19</a>:</strong>  72, and you're going to be like way too warm because of all the lights that are on, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:19">0:06:19-0:06:21</a>:</strong>  they're putting their radiant heat on you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:21">0:06:21-0:06:23</a>:</strong>  So you'll naturally turn the thermostat down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:23">0:06:23-0:06:27</a>:</strong>  You will be, and if you get really smart about this, and this is exactly what I demonstrated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:27">0:06:27-0:06:33</a>:</strong>  in this thing, if you're really smart about this, you can cut your electric heat by 87%.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:33">0:06:33-0:06:39</a>:</strong>  87% isn't even a legit number because that's for the entire winter when I did a whole bunch<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:39">0:06:39-0:06:44</a>:</strong>  of experiments, and towards the end we'd optimize the system a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:44">0:06:44-0:06:48</a>:</strong>  I think that if I did the whole experiment over again, I could get it down to like, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:48">0:06:48-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  cut the bill by 95%.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:55</a>:</strong>  Oh, that's some serious reduction there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:06:55">0:06:55-0:07:03</a>:</strong>  But the thing that's bizarre is that I can't seem to get people to believe it, even though<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:03">0:07:03-0:07:07</a>:</strong>  the information is already in their head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:07">0:07:07-0:07:09</a>:</strong>  Right, and I saw your TED Talk too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:09">0:07:09-0:07:13</a>:</strong>  You go into a lot more detail and explain how this works with visual aids and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:13">0:07:13-0:07:18</a>:</strong>  So for anybody who's looking for more clarity on this issue, you can search for Paul Wheaton<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:18">0:07:18-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  and TED Talk, and you'll come up with everything he's talking about here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:26</a>:</strong>  So you asked me about the experiments that I've done that are the most important, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:26">0:07:26-0:07:29</a>:</strong>  I've done, my life is all about experimentation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:29">0:07:29-0:07:32</a>:</strong>  I've done so many experiments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:32">0:07:32-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  I kind of feel like if I'm allowed one idea to convey to all people in the world in order<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  to solve the world's problems, I think I would go with that one because that would have the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:52</a>:</strong>  most positive impact globally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:52">0:07:52-0:07:58</a>:</strong>  I mean, I've got experiments with rocket mosquitoes, with the wafatis, with all kinds of horticultural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:07:58">0:07:58-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  endeavors like the hulu culture stuff and replacing irrigation with permaculture, all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:10</a>:</strong>  kinds, I mean, the list is massive and long, and I've got so much to say on so many different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:10">0:08:10-0:08:11</a>:</strong>  topics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:11">0:08:11-0:08:13</a>:</strong>  But you asked me which one was the most important, and it's that one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:13">0:08:13-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  It's kind of like, it's also really profound, the secondary experiment, which is the unfortunate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:27</a>:</strong>  experiment, it's so profound how people will know it's true, but they just can't let it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:27">0:08:27-0:08:28</a>:</strong>  into their head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, certainly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:29">0:08:29-0:08:34</a>:</strong>  And I don't know what more you could do with all the different material that you published<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:34">0:08:34-0:08:40</a>:</strong>  out there to help to convey exactly how simple this kind of stuff is to implement, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:40">0:08:40-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  in a country like the United States.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:48</a>:</strong>  But hey, maybe some more people listening to this will pick up on the information and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:48">0:08:48-0:08:51</a>:</strong>  start to implement it themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:51">0:08:51-0:08:57</a>:</strong>  I hope that someday somebody famous will carry it, or maybe somebody can just have a way<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:08:57">0:08:57-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  of presenting it that works its way into brains better than what I've presented today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:06</a>:</strong>  Hey, we'll throw down the gauntlet and see if somebody can pick that up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:06">0:09:06-0:09:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:07">0:09:07-0:09:12</a>:</strong>  All right, so moving on, you mentioned a ton of other experiments that you've been working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:12">0:09:12-0:09:14</a>:</strong>  on other than just the heating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:14">0:09:14-0:09:19</a>:</strong>  How have those experiments been received by the permaculture and natural building communities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:19">0:09:19-0:09:22</a>:</strong>  I know you just talked about that one that hasn't really been picked up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:22">0:09:22-0:09:27</a>:</strong>  Have there been others that have been really well adopted?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:27">0:09:27-0:09:30</a>:</strong>  I think hoover culture has probably been the one that's been most adopted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:30">0:09:30-0:09:36</a>:</strong>  And hoover culture is not my creation or invention.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:36">0:09:36-0:09:46</a>:</strong>  It is something that I think I might be the most famous for hoover culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:46">0:09:46-0:09:52</a>:</strong>  When I went to write an article about hoover culture on the internet, there was nothing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:52">0:09:52-0:09:56</a>:</strong>  on the internet about hoover culture, zero.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:09:56">0:09:56-0:10:03</a>:</strong>  So I wrote the first hoover culture article on the internet, but I don't want anybody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:03">0:10:03-0:10:05</a>:</strong>  to start thinking that I invented it or anything like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:05">0:10:05-0:10:06</a>:</strong>  No, it's nothing like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:06">0:10:06-0:10:13</a>:</strong>  I've heard about it and I did a lot of experimenting with it and I've evolved my theories and I've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:13">0:10:13-0:10:15</a>:</strong>  projected those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:15">0:10:15-0:10:18</a>:</strong>  And now I see a lot of stuff on the internet about hoover culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:18">0:10:18-0:10:24</a>:</strong>  I'm feeling a lot like, no, you're doing it wrong.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:24">0:10:24-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  No, you're doing it that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:35</a>:</strong>  So that's probably the thing where I've put a lot of work into that has gotten the most<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:35">0:10:35-0:10:39</a>:</strong>  traction with permaculture people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:39">0:10:39-0:10:50</a>:</strong>  With natural builders, I think, again, rocket mass heaters is something that I did not invent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:50">0:10:50-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  That's the work of Ianto Evans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:57</a>:</strong>  I've done some of the newer innovation behind it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:10:57">0:10:57-0:11:01</a>:</strong>  So I think pebble style rocket mass heaters are my creation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:01">0:11:01-0:11:07</a>:</strong>  And there's a couple of variations of rocket mass heaters that are mine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:07">0:11:07-0:11:15</a>:</strong>  I think my work in that area is more about trying to get the word out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:15">0:11:15-0:11:19</a>:</strong>  I'm pretty sure I put up the very first video on YouTube about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:19">0:11:19-0:11:24</a>:</strong>  I think I wrote the first article on the internet about it, stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:24">0:11:24-0:11:29</a>:</strong>  And the world of natural building, that's rocket mass heaters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:29">0:11:29-0:11:32</a>:</strong>  My work within the world of rocket mass heaters is probably what's gotten the most traction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:32">0:11:32-0:11:34</a>:</strong>  within the world of natural builders.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:34">0:11:34-0:11:41</a>:</strong>  I started to learn about hoover culture and rocket mass heaters from some of your articles,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:44</a>:</strong>  but I did later work with Ianto directly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  And funny enough, now that I'm here in Guatemala, one of his original inventions, like back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:11:54</a>:</strong>  in the 70s for stoves, the Lorena stoves, are actually pretty widely used in the comodores<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:54">0:11:54-0:11:57</a>:</strong>  and the markets around here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:11:57">0:11:57-0:12:05</a>:</strong>  So I'm actually doing some advanced work on rocket stoves and rocket ovens recently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:05">0:12:05-0:12:09</a>:</strong>  And it's kind of interesting to be spreading some more stove information from the guy who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:09">0:12:09-0:12:13</a>:</strong>  was here like 30, 40 years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:13">0:12:13-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  Pretty full circle in that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:15">0:12:15-0:12:21</a>:</strong>  So before we move on, can you go over very briefly what a rocket stove is and what a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:21">0:12:21-0:12:24</a>:</strong>  hoover culture bed is, for those who don't already know?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:24">0:12:24-0:12:30</a>:</strong>  Okay, so hoover culture is basically soil on wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:35</a>:</strong>  If you build a pile tall enough, which is generally about six or seven feet tall, then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:35">0:12:35-0:12:37</a>:</strong>  you don't have to irrigate it anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:37">0:12:37-0:12:40</a>:</strong>  And some people are kind of like, oh, well the neighbors think, and so they build something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:40">0:12:40-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  only two or three feet tall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:52</a>:</strong>  I could fill probably six hours of discussion about hoover culture and the finer points,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:52">0:12:52-0:12:58</a>:</strong>  but in general, soil on wood in a mound, and you plant all your favorite gardening plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:12:58">0:12:58-0:13:00</a>:</strong>  on there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:00">0:13:00-0:13:07</a>:</strong>  You then have less, you can reduce your irrigation worries to zero.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:07">0:13:07-0:13:11</a>:</strong>  Then there comes all this stuff about you don't have to worry so much about fertilizer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:11">0:13:11-0:13:15</a>:</strong>  or pest control or all these other things, your gardening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:15">0:13:15-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  In fact, with the permaculture promise that comes with hoover culture is that if you do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:28</a>:</strong>  a really good job, you won't have to do anything but harvest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:28">0:13:28-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  Rocket stoves and rocket mass heaters, I want to make it really clear that there's a differentiation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:42</a>:</strong>  and it has to do with how some people, I said something one time and somebody made it into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:42">0:13:42-0:13:44</a>:</strong>  a lovely graphic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:44">0:13:44-0:13:50</a>:</strong>  I said somebody was choosing to not understand the difference between a rocket stove and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:50">0:13:50-0:13:51</a>:</strong>  a rocket mass heater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:13:51">0:13:51-0:14:00</a>:</strong>  They were intentionally swapping the terms to prove that neither worked because they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:00">0:14:00-0:14:03</a>:</strong>  refused to glom onto the terms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:03">0:14:03-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  They're kind of like, well, you're going to have all this smoke.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  You say you're going to heat your home with one-tenth of the wood, but then you have all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:14</a>:</strong>  this smoke in your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:14">0:14:14-0:14:19</a>:</strong>  You're thinking of trying to use a cook stove that's intended for outdoor use inside your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:19">0:14:19-0:14:21</a>:</strong>  home.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:21">0:14:21-0:14:23</a>:</strong>  I'm trying to talk about using a rocket.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:23">0:14:23-0:14:26</a>:</strong>  Anyway, I said this thing about, okay, you know what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:26">0:14:26-0:14:31</a>:</strong>  You have to be this smart to ride this ride.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:31">0:14:31-0:14:34</a>:</strong>  You don't get to ride.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:34">0:14:34-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  This is for other people, not you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:43</a>:</strong>  There's this great graphic that this guy made where it's got me in a lab coat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:43">0:14:43-0:14:45</a>:</strong>  At the top of the chart, of course, is Albert Einstein.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:45">0:14:45-0:14:48</a>:</strong>  At the bottom of the chart is a goldfish.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:48">0:14:48-0:14:53</a>:</strong>  I'm holding my hand up to about 25 percent of the way up the chart.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:53">0:14:53-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  You must be this smart to ride this ride.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:15:05</a>:</strong>  So a rocket stove, when an American talks about a rocket stove, you're talking about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:05">0:15:05-0:15:11</a>:</strong>  a camping stove, a contraption that will cook your food with just a few twigs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:11">0:15:11-0:15:13</a>:</strong>  It will generate smoke.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:13">0:15:13-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  It just directs the heat very efficiently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:20</a>:</strong>  It's much better than an open fire or something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:20">0:15:20-0:15:21</a>:</strong>  You use a lot less fuel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:21">0:15:21-0:15:23</a>:</strong>  You don't have to pack up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:23">0:15:23-0:15:27</a>:</strong>  They used to use white gas to pack it up with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:27">0:15:27-0:15:32</a>:</strong>  You'd have this little teeny tiny cook stove that would run on the white gas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:32">0:15:32-0:15:36</a>:</strong>  Instead, you could just use twigs that are lying around.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:36">0:15:36-0:15:39</a>:</strong>  It will work extremely well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:39">0:15:39-0:15:42</a>:</strong>  But it's for outdoor use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:42">0:15:42-0:15:48</a>:</strong>  Now where you're at in Guatemala and throughout Africa, South America, and a lot of third<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:48">0:15:48-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  world nations, Asia, then some people it's like it's their culture to have basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:03</a>:</strong>  an open fire inside their house and it's all smoky inside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:03">0:16:03-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  That's their thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:06</a>:</strong>  That's what they're into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:06">0:16:06-0:16:15</a>:</strong>  In fact, Ianto has a wonderful story about his first time, I believe it was in Africa,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:15">0:16:15-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  and he thought he was saving the world and he brought them solar ovens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:23</a>:</strong>  He came back three months later and all the solar ovens were gone, but everybody sported<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:23">0:16:23-0:16:29</a>:</strong>  some really shiny jewelry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:29">0:16:29-0:16:31</a>:</strong>  He says it wasn't a cultural fit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:31">0:16:31-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  They burned wood and they're home to cook.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:34</a>:</strong>  That's what they do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:34">0:16:34-0:16:41</a>:</strong>  Now, then he brings in the rocket stove and they start cooking with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:41">0:16:41-0:16:48</a>:</strong>  It cooks their food with one-tenth the wood and there's hardly any smoke inside the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:48">0:16:48-0:16:57</a>:</strong>  This one place in a village has this and what happened was that the woman next door will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:16:57">0:16:57-0:17:03</a>:</strong>  go to her guy and say, hey, you're going to get me one of those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:03">0:17:03-0:17:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's how it catches on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:07">0:17:07-0:17:13</a>:</strong>  As opposed to a rocket mass heater where Ianto comes back to the United States and he's kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:13">0:17:13-0:17:18</a>:</strong>  of like, these wars that are fighting are over energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:18">0:17:18-0:17:25</a>:</strong>  All this pollution that's all over the place is tied to energy and the number one energy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:25">0:17:25-0:17:27</a>:</strong>  thing in the United States.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:27">0:17:27-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  Here's another thing that people just can't seem to understand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:41</a>:</strong>  The number one energy consumer is heat, home heat, number one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:41">0:17:41-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  In fact, if you switch from electric heat to a rocket mass heater, that reduces your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:53</a>:</strong>  carbon footprint as much as parking seven cars.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:53">0:17:53-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  Everybody's all focused on cars.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:01</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of work to be done in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:02</a>:</strong>  There's a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:02">0:18:02-0:18:06</a>:</strong>  It's like, oh, my carbon footprint, I'm going to get a Tesla.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:06">0:18:06-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  It's like you could do seven times more than that if you just switch from electric heat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:15</a>:</strong>  to a rocket mass heater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:15">0:18:15-0:18:17</a>:</strong>  A rocket mass heater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:21</a>:</strong>  First of all, all the exhaust is routed outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:21">0:18:21-0:18:26</a>:</strong>  You don't just build a fire in the middle of your living room.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:26">0:18:26-0:18:28</a>:</strong>  Something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:28">0:18:28-0:18:31</a>:</strong>  It's got the same innards of a rocket stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:31">0:18:31-0:18:32</a>:</strong>  This is Ianto's invention.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:32">0:18:32-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  He took rocket stove technology and he made something that was extremely cheap and easy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:40</a>:</strong>  to make.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:40">0:18:40-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  It routed all the exhaust outside so it's good for Americans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  You heat your home with one tenth the wood of a container of smoke.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:56</a>:</strong>  You would think that by burning one tenth of the wood, you would have one tenth of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:18:56">0:18:56-0:19:03</a>:</strong>  smoke but it's actually closer to one one hundredth, one one thousandth of the smoke.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:03">0:19:03-0:19:06</a>:</strong>  Those are some statistics people can get on board with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:06">0:19:06-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  So now I'm in Montana.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:18</a>:</strong>  We've had snow on the ground for the last month, maybe more than a month without a day<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:21</a>:</strong>  It's been cold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:21">0:19:21-0:19:27</a>:</strong>  It's gotten below zero and I think we're going to finish up the winter having heated this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:27">0:19:27-0:19:34</a>:</strong>  place with only half a cord of wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:34">0:19:34-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  This same place with conventional wood stove would be burning six cords of wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:42</a>:</strong>  Hey, hang on one second.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:42">0:19:42-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  We've got the dogs going crazy over here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:47</a>:</strong>  I'll be right back with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:47">0:19:47-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  The challenge of doing a podcast when there are nine dogs on the property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:58</a>:</strong>  It's no small amount.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:19:58">0:19:58-0:20:03</a>:</strong>  So my next question then was, I know that one of the biggest innovations in the reduction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:03">0:20:03-0:20:08</a>:</strong>  on heating costs and energy has been the home rocket mass heater like you talked about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:08">0:20:08-0:20:13</a>:</strong>  You've actually got an entire DVD series on how to build them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:13">0:20:13-0:20:18</a>:</strong>  So you've talked about the statistics and how it can actually reduce your heat bill,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:18">0:20:18-0:20:23</a>:</strong>  cut down on the amount of energy that you use, generally good for the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:23">0:20:23-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  What sort of materials do you need and is this something that's approachable for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:31</a>:</strong>  lay person to make themselves?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:31">0:20:31-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  Well we're trying to make it better and better and better every passing year for people to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:37">0:20:37-0:20:38</a>:</strong>  do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:38">0:20:38-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  So we kind of came up with this term we call it the DIY level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:46</a>:</strong>  So how much DIY skill do you need to have to build a rocket mass heater?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:46">0:20:46-0:20:52</a>:</strong>  And we are, with each year we're finding ways to reduce that more and more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:20:52">0:20:52-0:21:01</a>:</strong>  A big thing we're doing now is we're pushing, like one of the DVDs from the new DVD set<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:01">0:21:01-0:21:03</a>:</strong>  is all about shippable cores.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:03">0:21:03-0:21:08</a>:</strong>  And so we're trying to encourage people to start businesses of building shippable cores<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:08">0:21:08-0:21:13</a>:</strong>  and then shipping them to people who want to build a rocket mass heater because with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:13">0:21:13-0:21:19</a>:</strong>  the shippable core the rest of it becomes really, really simple, really easy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:19">0:21:19-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  It's the core that's challenging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  Through the DVD set, I mean we explore a lot of different rocket mass heaters built in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:34</a>:</strong>  a lot of different ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:34">0:21:34-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  We've got the basic, the plain basic simple ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  We've got stuff that uses some new materials that have been making rocket mass heaters<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  rocketier and cleaner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:56</a>:</strong>  There's people out there that have built a rocket mass heater using just 20 bucks and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:56">0:21:56-0:21:59</a>:</strong>  scrounged farts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:21:59">0:21:59-0:22:04</a>:</strong>  And then there's people that want to go first class all the way and they build some magnificent,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:04">0:22:04-0:22:05</a>:</strong>  beautiful thing for like $2,000.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:05">0:22:05-0:22:08</a>:</strong>  So the answer to your question…<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:08">0:22:08-0:22:16</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of opportunity to scale it up is what you're talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:16">0:22:16-0:22:22</a>:</strong>  I guess it's going to depend, I mean what we want to do is show people a lot of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:22">0:22:22-0:22:27</a>:</strong>  different things that have been done and then people choose for themselves which path is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:27">0:22:27-0:22:29</a>:</strong>  best for their situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:29">0:22:29-0:22:33</a>:</strong>  Okay, so they have some options to work with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:40</a>:</strong>  I think that the most popular route is to build a cob style rocket mass heater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:40">0:22:40-0:22:48</a>:</strong>  So this is where you're going to use clay, sand and sometimes straw for most of the structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:48">0:22:48-0:22:55</a>:</strong>  And I don't know about, I've been to so many different properties where some people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:55">0:22:55-0:22:58</a>:</strong>  have clay, some people have sand, some people don't have either.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:22:58">0:22:58-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  I happen to be in a place where I have both for free.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:08</a>:</strong>  All I want, oodles of it, mountains of it, literally, rocky mountains full of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:08">0:23:08-0:23:14</a>:</strong>  And I could build hundreds of cob homes and thousands of rocket mass heaters with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:14">0:23:14-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  clay and sand that I have at no cost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:22</a>:</strong>  But like Ianto, he's got clay but he doesn't have sand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:22">0:23:22-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  Yup, we've had some imported there when I've worked there in the past.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:34</a>:</strong>  A dump truck comes, drops off sand and then you, Oliver, are set up with a wheelbarrow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:34">0:23:34-0:23:40</a>:</strong>  and you go up and down that little path like 40 times with wheelbarrow loads of sand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:40">0:23:40-0:23:43</a>:</strong>  Well, I'll tell you what I was doing earlier today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:43">0:23:43-0:23:48</a>:</strong>  I'm building a rocket oven for a client, one of the neighbors here in Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:48">0:23:48-0:23:51</a>:</strong>  And they have a really small property but they only have a place where you can really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:51">0:23:51-0:23:52</a>:</strong>  dig.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:52">0:23:52-0:23:58</a>:</strong>  And so we've been hauling bags of both clay and sand strapped with lassos on our heads<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:23:58">0:23:58-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  and the bags on our back and hiking them up the mountain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:05</a>:</strong>  So that's the other option.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:05">0:24:05-0:24:09</a>:</strong>  And I think you're going to lose a lot of your eco points once you start doing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:09">0:24:09-0:24:12</a>:</strong>  As long as it's people, we're not burning a lot of fuel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:12">0:24:12-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  And it's not that long of a walk but it is quite a bit uphill and it's on a road that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  machines can't get to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:19">0:24:19-0:24:26</a>:</strong>  Luckily all the sand comes from the nearby riverbed which is replenished every year because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:26">0:24:26-0:24:29</a>:</strong>  we're in the mountains and rocks and sand just fall down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:29">0:24:29-0:24:32</a>:</strong>  And clay soil is also close by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:32">0:24:32-0:24:43</a>:</strong>  But when you're walking it, it does feel a little bit further.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:43">0:24:43-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  I think that you end up with something, when you pack stuff in like that and you make anything,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:57</a>:</strong>  whatever it is that you're making, then it ends up being more beautiful because clearly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:24:57">0:24:57-0:25:00</a>:</strong>  you kind of look around like where do they get these materials?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:00">0:25:00-0:25:03</a>:</strong>  Did they pack that in here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:03">0:25:03-0:25:06</a>:</strong>  Then it does have more value.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:06">0:25:06-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  But on the other hand when you're trying to talk to somebody about like, yeah there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:17</a>:</strong>  a guy that built one for 20 bucks, then it's kind of like people are quick to dismiss the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:17">0:25:17-0:25:22</a>:</strong>  idea if they're thinking that they're going to, like the only way to do it is that they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:22">0:25:22-0:25:28</a>:</strong>  going to have to get a big packet of sand and somehow strap it to their forehead to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:28">0:25:28-0:25:33</a>:</strong>  carry it up a mountainside which seems to come up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:33">0:25:33-0:25:34</a>:</strong>  You don't live on a mountain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:34">0:25:34-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah but I heard the thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:43</a>:</strong>  The guy was packing it up with a strap on his head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:43">0:25:43-0:25:48</a>:</strong>  People don't take so many circumstances into account when they see these really low prices<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:25:52</a>:</strong>  from certain projects and they're like, oh well certainly everything that I'm doing is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:52">0:25:52-0:25:54</a>:</strong>  exactly the same as that project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:54">0:25:54-0:25:56</a>:</strong>  It has to cost the same amount.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:56">0:25:56-0:25:58</a>:</strong>  Variables, variables, variables.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:25:58">0:25:58-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  I can't say that's definitely enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:02">0:26:02-0:26:09</a>:</strong>  I've seen so many straw bale houses built where the straw came from 1500 miles away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:09">0:26:09-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  The semi-truck delivered it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:22</a>:</strong>  It's like okay so maybe you should have done something that's, it's like Art Ludwig has<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:22">0:26:22-0:26:29</a>:</strong>  that article, can a 4,000 square foot home be green?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:29">0:26:29-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  My response to that was is like yeah you've got a dozen people living in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:38</a>:</strong>  And then I actually recorded a podcast with Art where we kind of, and he was like, oh<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:38">0:26:38-0:26:41</a>:</strong>  he still thinks it won't be green.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:41">0:26:41-0:26:47</a>:</strong>  And then on top of that, a lot of people are like my house is green and it's like they've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:47">0:26:47-0:26:51</a>:</strong>  kind of cheated in so many different ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:51">0:26:51-0:26:56</a>:</strong>  I think a lot of it is that you build a home with the materials that you have either on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:26:56">0:26:56-0:27:00</a>:</strong>  site or really close by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:00">0:27:00-0:27:07</a>:</strong>  So a straw bale home makes great sense if you're out in a big prairie where there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:07">0:27:07-0:27:09</a>:</strong>  a lot of grasses growing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:09">0:27:09-0:27:13</a>:</strong>  Then straw bales are a smart thing there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:13">0:27:13-0:27:20</a>:</strong>  But if you're hundreds of miles away from the nearest straw field then it's kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:20">0:27:20-0:27:27</a>:</strong>  like, I think that's not going to be an optimal fit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:32</a>:</strong>  Sure, but one of the things you have to keep in mind is like depending on the climate,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:32">0:27:32-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  thermal mass is going to offer a whole lot more problems and maybe you're going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:43</a>:</strong>  lose all the eco points for having the materials come from straight up on site when you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:43">0:27:43-0:27:48</a>:</strong>  trying to heat it in a really cold climate and that thermal mass is just not keeping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:48">0:27:48-0:27:50</a>:</strong>  anything out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:50">0:27:50-0:27:55</a>:</strong>  So you've got to balance both sides in any of these projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:27:55">0:27:55-0:28:00</a>:</strong>  I know exactly what you're talking about but there are always other aspects to consider.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:00">0:28:00-0:28:01</a>:</strong>  There are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:01">0:28:01-0:28:02</a>:</strong>  Oh, there are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:02">0:28:02-0:28:03</a>:</strong>  There are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:03">0:28:03-0:28:07</a>:</strong>  Which is why my job is always fun because I help coach people through these decisions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:07">0:28:07-0:28:13</a>:</strong>  for both their gardens and their buildings and no two sites are the same so I never get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:13">0:28:13-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  bored.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:19</a>:</strong>  Well, I think one thing is that if you've got something that's a strong success in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:19">0:28:19-0:28:25</a>:</strong>  an area then the neighbors oftentimes will rubber stamp that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:25">0:28:25-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:30</a>:</strong>  They'll try to build something that's almost exactly the same and so you've got to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:30">0:28:30-0:28:36</a>:</strong>  be careful about what you create because next thing you know you've got 15 other people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:36">0:28:36-0:28:39</a>:</strong>  that are having all this straw bale stuff imported.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:39">0:28:39-0:28:40</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:40">0:28:40-0:28:46</a>:</strong>  Especially the way these online communities work, somebody comes up with a new idea that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:46">0:28:46-0:28:50</a>:</strong>  worked really well for where they are and everybody tries to implement it wherever they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:50">0:28:50-0:28:51</a>:</strong>  happen to be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:51">0:28:51-0:28:57</a>:</strong>  Again, not taking into consideration why it worked in that place and what might be a problem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:28:59</a>:</strong>  where they are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:28:59">0:28:59-0:29:00</a>:</strong>  And they're going to learn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:00">0:29:00-0:29:01</a>:</strong>  I like how it…<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:01">0:29:01-0:29:02</a>:</strong>  And it fills your forums.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:02">0:29:02-0:29:03</a>:</strong>  What's that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:03">0:29:03-0:29:07</a>:</strong>  And it fills your forums, the results of all this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:07">0:29:07-0:29:13</a>:</strong>  Well, yes, it does fill the forums and our forums are packed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:13">0:29:13-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  And I think that we've done a really good job of qualifying a lot of this stuff and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:28</a>:</strong>  we encourage people to point out all of the little flaws and stuff and to question things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:28">0:29:28-0:29:31</a>:</strong>  However, you know, question it respectfully.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:31">0:29:31-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:38</a>:</strong>  So we've got quite a bit of rules but I think that you look at most of these projects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:38">0:29:38-0:29:41</a>:</strong>  and you're going to find a lot of discussion back and forth on these very topics where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:41">0:29:41-0:29:46</a>:</strong>  it's going to be kind of like, okay, well, why did you choose to use a straw bale when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:46">0:29:46-0:29:50</a>:</strong>  you're so far away from where straw bales come from?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:50">0:29:50-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:29:58</a>:</strong>  You know, and I think people are pretty good at answering those questions and I mean there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:29:58">0:29:58-0:30:01</a>:</strong>  a lot of amazing projects that you can see.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:01">0:30:01-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  And the fun thing is there's no right answer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:08</a>:</strong>  There's, you know, a lot of it is personal and a lot of it is based on what has worked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:08">0:30:08-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  for other people, what, you know, needs to be taken account for your site and it really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:16</a>:</strong>  keeps for live discussions on there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:16">0:30:16-0:30:18</a>:</strong>  Well, and things are changing too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:18">0:30:18-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  All the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  And it's the change that I'm the most interested in to see what we're coming up with next.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:33</a>:</strong>  So so many people are really married to the stuff that was figured out 30 years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:33">0:30:33-0:30:36</a>:</strong>  And it's like we've come so far since then.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:36">0:30:36-0:30:39</a>:</strong>  Oh, I have so many stories about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:39">0:30:39-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:30:47</a>:</strong>  It's like, you know, I think the Earthship might, you know, 30 years ago I was so in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:47">0:30:47-0:30:48</a>:</strong>  love with the Earthship.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:48">0:30:48-0:30:51</a>:</strong>  My Earthship book was so tattered.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:51">0:30:51-0:30:55</a>:</strong>  And when the guy said, you know what, because somebody asked the question like, well, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:30:59</a>:</strong>  if a spring pops up in the middle of my Earthship?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:30:59">0:30:59-0:31:01</a>:</strong>  And I thought, ooh, that's a tough one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:01">0:31:01-0:31:04</a>:</strong>  And the guy's answer was so awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:04">0:31:04-0:31:09</a>:</strong>  It's like, now you have a water feature right in your home.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:09">0:31:09-0:31:13</a>:</strong>  I was kind of thinking like, yeah, you can totally make that work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:13">0:31:13-0:31:14</a>:</strong>  That would be cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:14">0:31:14-0:31:18</a>:</strong>  Now, after the coolness, my head wore off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:18">0:31:18-0:31:24</a>:</strong>  The next problem that comes up years later, I figured out that it brings another kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:24">0:31:24-0:31:25</a>:</strong>  of coolness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:25">0:31:25-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  The water, the temperature of that water is going to be 45 degrees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:32</a>:</strong>  That's going to be cooling the inside of your house a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:32">0:31:32-0:31:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah, how can you route that cooling to be effective in other spaces?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:38">0:31:38-0:31:42</a>:</strong>  How can you make that cooling work for you in the wintertime?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:42">0:31:42-0:31:44</a>:</strong>  That's a tough one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:44">0:31:44-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:54</a>:</strong>  But, okay, and now here we are 30 years later and for every person that is in love with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:31:54">0:31:54-0:32:01</a>:</strong>  it, in love with the idea of building an Earthship, there's, I don't know, I'm doing the numbers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:01">0:32:01-0:32:02</a>:</strong>  all wrong.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:05</a>:</strong>  For every person who's actually built an Earthship, there's probably 100 people that are in love<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:05">0:32:05-0:32:06</a>:</strong>  with the idea of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:06">0:32:06-0:32:11</a>:</strong>  For every person that's probably built an Earthship and likes it, there's probably at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:11">0:32:11-0:32:17</a>:</strong>  least one person who's built one and has decided no thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:17">0:32:17-0:32:25</a>:</strong>  I think that Earthships bring us so, so much as ideas, but I think that they're not working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:25">0:32:25-0:32:31</a>:</strong>  out as well as the dreamers would like them to work out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:31">0:32:31-0:32:35</a>:</strong>  I've heard that from a lot of people and I used to work in a community right next to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:35">0:32:35-0:32:38</a>:</strong>  the original Earthship community in Taos, New Mexico.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:38">0:32:38-0:32:44</a>:</strong>  There were a lot of bird-hounds from that community who had gone to other types of buildings<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:44">0:32:44-0:32:49</a>:</strong>  and obviously that doesn't mean scrap the idea, throw the baby out with the bathwater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:49">0:32:49-0:32:53</a>:</strong>  There's tons of great innovations that came out of that, but I can deal with you there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:53">0:32:53-0:32:59</a>:</strong>  There have been a lot of new innovations since then as well that we can compound on, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:32:59">0:32:59-0:33:04</a>:</strong>  we can move past and even improve on those originals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:04">0:33:04-0:33:05</a>:</strong>  I agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:05">0:33:05-0:33:06</a>:</strong>  I agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:06">0:33:06-0:33:07</a>:</strong>  All right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:07">0:33:07-0:33:09</a>:</strong>  I can't remember what the question was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:09">0:33:09-0:33:10</a>:</strong>  Did I answer it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:10">0:33:10-0:33:11</a>:</strong>  I think you did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:11">0:33:11-0:33:14</a>:</strong>  I think you might have answered some other ones accidentally, so we're doing really good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:14">0:33:14-0:33:21</a>:</strong>  While we're on the topic of the forums at permes.com, they've undeniably become the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:25</a>:</strong>  biggest single discussion ground for all things pertaining to regenerative and sustainable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:25">0:33:25-0:33:26</a>:</strong>  living.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:26">0:33:26-0:33:31</a>:</strong>  Why do you think it's so important to foster these forums and to give people space to contribute<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:31">0:33:31-0:33:35</a>:</strong>  ideas and their own experiments?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:35">0:33:35-0:33:43</a>:</strong>  I actually didn't think the forums would get to be this big, but what I did do is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:43">0:33:43-0:33:51</a>:</strong>  I went out to forums to try and find discussion on the things that I wanted to talk about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  and I really couldn't get traction anywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:33:55">0:33:55-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  I'd go some place and it would turn political or I'd go some other place and then they were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:06</a>:</strong>  like if you're not using Roundup, you're not farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:06">0:34:06-0:34:08</a>:</strong>  There was all kinds of stuff that didn't work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:08">0:34:08-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  One of them was like Americans are all stupid, so piss off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:20</a>:</strong>  I finally ended up thinking like, okay, I just want to talk about this stuff, so I created<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:20">0:34:20-0:34:25</a>:</strong>  my own forums so that I could talk about the things I want to talk about, the way that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:25">0:34:25-0:34:27</a>:</strong>  I want to talk about them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:27">0:34:27-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  I kind of feel like it's one place on the internet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:33</a>:</strong>  It's not the place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:33">0:34:33-0:34:39</a>:</strong>  It's one place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:39">0:34:39-0:34:41</a>:</strong>  A lot of people are very angry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:41">0:34:41-0:34:51</a>:</strong>  They're like, oh, you won't let me talk about how I hate people that are not vegans or you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:51">0:34:51-0:34:59</a>:</strong>  won't let me hate on that other group or you won't... censorship, and I want to say censorship<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:34:59">0:34:59-0:35:00</a>:</strong>  is my life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:35:00">0:35:00-0:35:01</a>:</strong>  That's what I'm going to do.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:36:38">0:36:38-0:36:40</a>:</strong>  are using more conventional wood stoves.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:07">0:37:07-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  they do that.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:33</a>:</strong>  I want to say use a J-tube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:33">0:37:33-0:37:36</a>:</strong>  Oh, way ahead of you, J-tube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:36">0:37:36-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:38</a>:</strong>  Done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:38">0:37:38-0:37:39</a>:</strong>  That's cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:39">0:37:39-0:37:41</a>:</strong>  That gravity feed, you can't beat it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:41">0:37:41-0:37:44</a>:</strong>  You can't beat that gravity feed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:44">0:37:44-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  The gravity feed is such a smart way to go in so many ways, and there's arguments for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:51">0:37:51-0:37:55</a>:</strong>  the L-tube and the J-tube, and now there's batch box out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:55">0:37:55-0:37:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:56">0:37:56-0:37:57</a>:</strong>  I've used both.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:37:57">0:37:57-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  I really have, and I'm with you on the J-tube thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:10</a>:</strong>  Batch box always ends up that they don't put the damn door on it, and then you've got to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:10">0:38:10-0:38:11</a>:</strong>  figure out the door.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:11">0:38:11-0:38:13</a>:</strong>  It's like, all right, I made you a batch box.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:13">0:38:13-0:38:18</a>:</strong>  It's like, it's a beautiful system, so much better than a J-tube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:18">0:38:18-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  Oh, look at the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:21</a>:</strong>  I got to go home.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:22</a>:</strong>  Bye now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:22">0:38:22-0:38:24</a>:</strong>  Good luck with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:24">0:38:24-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  Half baked idea there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:26">0:38:26-0:38:28</a>:</strong>  It's the door that's the issue.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:28">0:38:28-0:38:33</a>:</strong>  It's like if you don't design the door in from the very beginning, the whole thing is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:33">0:38:33-0:38:40</a>:</strong>  a festering turd, and it sucks, and it doesn't work the way it needs to work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:40">0:38:40-0:38:47</a>:</strong>  It's a mess, but then a J-tube, it's like when it comes time to put the door on it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:47">0:38:47-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  it's like, oy, there you put two fire bricks right there, and you're done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  It took about what, seven seconds to put the door on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:39:00</a>:</strong>  That's a little bit easier too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:00">0:39:00-0:39:10</a>:</strong>  I've seen a lot of people doing, so rocket ovens and indoor wood cook stoves are the,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:10">0:39:10-0:39:15</a>:</strong>  I want to say like, orange is the new black or something, but indoor wood cook stoves,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:15">0:39:15-0:39:20</a>:</strong>  the rocket technology is the fashion for 2017.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:20">0:39:20-0:39:26</a>:</strong>  It's like we're seeing so many designs, and so many really beautiful ones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:26">0:39:26-0:39:35</a>:</strong>  We have three of them here now that are just amazing, and each by a different artist.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:35">0:39:35-0:39:41</a>:</strong>  In fact, I think two of them are actually batch box systems, but they built the door<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:41">0:39:41-0:39:44</a>:</strong>  from the very beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:44">0:39:44-0:39:50</a>:</strong>  Of course, we've got all kinds of welding gear, and the people who built them had expertise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:39:51</a>:</strong>  in welding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:51">0:39:51-0:39:58</a>:</strong>  A lot of people, they don't have that expertise, and so then it's like the J-tube is really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:58">0:39:58-0:39:59</a>:</strong>  the way to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:39:59">0:39:59-0:40:02</a>:</strong>  Ease of use, yeah, I agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:02">0:40:02-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah, the batch box has some great perks, but that door thing, you would think, oh,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:11</a>:</strong>  it's so simple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:11">0:40:11-0:40:12</a>:</strong>  I mean, we can all imagine a door.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:12">0:40:12-0:40:13</a>:</strong>  It's so easy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:13">0:40:13-0:40:15</a>:</strong>  There's nothing to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:15">0:40:15-0:40:22</a>:</strong>  You're trying to get steel to meet masonry, and by the way, you have to design it in such<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:22">0:40:22-0:40:26</a>:</strong>  a way that the fire doesn't melt the steel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:26">0:40:26-0:40:32</a>:</strong>  Now, you asked earlier about what is a rocket mass heater, and the big difference between<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:32">0:40:32-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  a conventional wood stove and a rocket mass heater is that with a conventional wood stove,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  you've got a fire and a metal box, and you're trying to get the heat in the room just as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:45</a>:</strong>  fast as you can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:45">0:40:45-0:40:50</a>:</strong>  The heat from the fire goes into the room, and then whatever's left goes up the chimney.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:50">0:40:50-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  With a rocket mass heater, we don't let the heat into the room in the beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:05</a>:</strong>  We burn the fire in an insulated space, so that way it gets hotter, hotter, hotter, hotter,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:05">0:41:05-0:41:10</a>:</strong>  hotter, and we get to a temperature that is far hotter than what you could ever possibly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:10">0:41:10-0:41:12</a>:</strong>  have in a conventional wood stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:12">0:41:12-0:41:18</a>:</strong>  This burns all the creosote and all the smoke, so you get a much cleaner burn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:18">0:41:18-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  Plus, now it's moving in a strong direction, and then we harvest the heat from it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:30</a>:</strong>  That's the big difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:30">0:41:30-0:41:31</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's the key stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:31">0:41:31-0:41:40</a>:</strong>  You're trying to do something with steel, and it's near where it's supposed to get hot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:40">0:41:40-0:41:45</a>:</strong>  The temperatures we're shooting for are like 3,000 degrees or so, and steel is liquid at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:45">0:41:45-0:41:50</a>:</strong>  2,600, so then it doesn't hold up so good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:50">0:41:50-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  Now, if you've got a conventional wood stove, generally your fire tops out at 1,200, 1,300<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:01</a>:</strong>  degrees at a conventional wood stove, so the hottest you'll ever see is you'll start to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:01">0:42:01-0:42:05</a>:</strong>  see the steel glow a little bit, but that's it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:05">0:42:05-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  That's as hot as it gets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:11</a>:</strong>  But in a rocket mass heater, we're going to melt it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:14</a>:</strong>  You can't actually melt that steel out, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:14">0:42:14-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  There's been a lot of YouTube videos where people are like, rocket mass heaters suck<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  because it all melted, and they're showing video of the inside where it all melted away,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:26</a>:</strong>  and it's like, yeah, don't put metal there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:26">0:42:26-0:42:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, don't do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:28">0:42:28-0:42:30</a>:</strong>  That could be a good idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:30">0:42:30-0:42:38</a>:</strong>  No, I've been using mostly bricks, just exclusively bricks lately, and a mix of lime and cement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:38">0:42:38-0:42:41</a>:</strong>  that holds up a lot better against heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:41">0:42:41-0:42:45</a>:</strong>  Are you using Portland cement?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:45">0:42:45-0:42:50</a>:</strong>  Very small amounts, but for anything that's touching the burn tube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:50">0:42:50-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  So let me just ask, Portland cement will fall at 600 degrees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:42:57</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:42:57">0:42:57-0:43:02</a>:</strong>  Wherever you use Portland cement, make sure it's an area that won't get above 600 degrees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:02">0:43:02-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  So right next to the burny bits, no Portland cement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:08</a>:</strong>  You can use cob.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:08">0:43:08-0:43:11</a>:</strong>  Cob will be fine because that's just sand and clay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:11">0:43:11-0:43:19</a>:</strong>  Clay doesn't liquefy until something like 4,000 degrees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:19">0:43:19-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  And sand generally doesn't liquefy until something past 2,000, but when it's with the clay, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  clay tends to protect it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  We've done a lot of stuff where we've made stuff with a mixture of clay and perlite,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:42</a>:</strong>  and perlite is a type of puffed rock, and it will liquefy, I believe, at, oh man, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:42">0:43:42-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  think it puffs at 1,400 and it melts at 2,400.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  It becomes liquid at 2,400.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:53</a>:</strong>  We've had a lot of systems where we put that in there, and we'll pull out gobs of perlite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:53">0:43:53-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  glass after a burn a couple weeks later.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:43:57</a>:</strong>  Oh wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:43:57">0:43:57-0:44:04</a>:</strong>  And so what we've figured out is happening is that where the hot area is, that the perlite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:04">0:44:04-0:44:10</a>:</strong>  there melts, but then the clay will protect the perlite that's further away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:10">0:44:10-0:44:11</a>:</strong>  Interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:11">0:44:11-0:44:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:12">0:44:12-0:44:21</a>:</strong>  But I'm even moving away from the use of perlite in my systems, other than in an area where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:21">0:44:21-0:44:23</a>:</strong>  it won't get very hot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:23">0:44:23-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  But for the cores, I'm not using it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:32</a>:</strong>  Now for brick, you've got to be careful, I mean if you can get a brick that is definitely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:32">0:44:32-0:44:36</a>:</strong>  a clay brick, then that's fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:36">0:44:36-0:44:43</a>:</strong>  And then of course fire brick, actual fire brick is fine, but most brick today is actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:43">0:44:43-0:44:46</a>:</strong>  a product of Portland cement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:46">0:44:46-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  And you've got to keep in mind that, hey, we're all eco-conscious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:44:54</a>:</strong>  Portland cement has a massive carbon footprint.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:44:54">0:44:54-0:45:04</a>:</strong>  I think of all the industrialized stuff of everything, even caused, I believe one third<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:04">0:45:04-0:45:08</a>:</strong>  of that carbon footprint is the manufacture of Portland cement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:08">0:45:08-0:45:11</a>:</strong>  Wow, that's quite a statistic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:11">0:45:11-0:45:15</a>:</strong>  I don't know where, I've heard a different statistic, but it's up there for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:15">0:45:15-0:45:16</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:16">0:45:16-0:45:20</a>:</strong>  I mean the carbon footprint is more than just what humans create.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:20">0:45:20-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  Definitely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:31</a>:</strong>  But still, of what humans have created, the last statistic I saw on it was one third is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:31">0:45:31-0:45:32</a>:</strong>  the manufacture of Portland cement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:32">0:45:32-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  Well, it's always worth keeping in mind when you're doing build projects of any kind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:38">0:45:38-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  Even a little bit of cement is really going to increase the footprint of whatever it is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:42</a>:</strong>  you're making.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:42">0:45:42-0:45:47</a>:</strong>  Now on the other hand, if you're going to build a rocket mass heater with a little bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:47">0:45:47-0:45:52</a>:</strong>  of Portland cement, it will probably- You can be forgiven for that, for the energy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:52">0:45:52-0:45:53</a>:</strong>  savings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:45:53">0:45:53-0:46:01</a>:</strong>  Well, you're going to reverse carbon footprint so much with it that it's going to more, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:01">0:46:01-0:46:06</a>:</strong>  probably going to displace that carbon footprint in the first week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:06">0:46:06-0:46:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:07">0:46:07-0:46:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:08">0:46:08-0:46:11</a>:</strong>  Yep, there's all those variables.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:11">0:46:11-0:46:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:12">0:46:12-0:46:15</a>:</strong>  And that's what builds your forums.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:15">0:46:15-0:46:18</a>:</strong>  That's true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:18">0:46:18-0:46:19</a>:</strong>  That's true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:19">0:46:19-0:46:23</a>:</strong>  And a lot of people that are watching all, make sure that everybody's dotted the I's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:23">0:46:23-0:46:26</a>:</strong>  and crossed the T's on all the details of everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:26">0:46:26-0:46:27</a>:</strong>  That's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:27">0:46:27-0:46:28</a>:</strong>  He's censoring all of you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:28">0:46:28-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  Oh, no, I'm thinking about if you're going to try and build something, like when people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:41</a>:</strong>  try to build a cob house in Montana, then you'll have people in the forums that'll say<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:41">0:46:41-0:46:50</a>:</strong>  like, dude, you need something that insulates, you're going to be so cold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:50">0:46:50-0:46:51</a>:</strong>  Stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:51">0:46:51-0:46:52</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:52">0:46:52-0:46:57</a>:</strong>  And it's all, yeah, you've got to take into account everything that they're planning on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:46:57">0:46:57-0:47:03</a>:</strong>  doing, how they're planning on overcoming some of the obstacles that would take out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:03">0:47:03-0:47:05</a>:</strong>  someone else's project if they hadn't considered it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:05">0:47:05-0:47:10</a>:</strong>  It goes on and on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:10">0:47:10-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  What's next?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:12</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:12">0:47:12-0:47:18</a>:</strong>  So I've always wanted to ask you this because I know like me, you're a big fan of Seth Holzer's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:18">0:47:18-0:47:19</a>:</strong>  work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:19">0:47:19-0:47:23</a>:</strong>  And for anybody who hasn't heard of Seth Holzer, you need to get on the YouTube right away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:23">0:47:23-0:47:28</a>:</strong>  He has a fantastic documentary called the Rebel Gardener.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:28">0:47:28-0:47:33</a>:</strong>  He's a really innovative farmer from Austria and there's a ton you can learn about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:33">0:47:33-0:47:36</a>:</strong>  He's got some great books out there as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:36">0:47:36-0:47:40</a>:</strong>  What are some of the most influential aspects from his teachings and his philosophies about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:40">0:47:40-0:47:46</a>:</strong>  farming that have affected your work?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:46">0:47:46-0:47:54</a>:</strong>  The first time I met Seth, I tried to share with him some of my ideas and then he yelled<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:54">0:47:54-0:47:58</a>:</strong>  out catastrophe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:47:58">0:47:58-0:48:06</a>:</strong>  And I think that's the only English word he knows, which because the German word is catastrophic,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:06">0:48:06-0:48:09</a>:</strong>  because I've heard him say that too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:09">0:48:09-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  But the funny thing is that I showed him my ideas, he said catastrophe and then later<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:23</a>:</strong>  when his book comes out in English, there's my ideas which are different from what he<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:23">0:48:23-0:48:25</a>:</strong>  used to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:25">0:48:25-0:48:29</a>:</strong>  So I kind of...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:29">0:48:29-0:48:32</a>:</strong>  What are the greatest influences that Seth has had?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:32">0:48:32-0:48:40</a>:</strong>  Oh, geez, that guy is amazing because he did it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:40">0:48:40-0:48:46</a>:</strong>  And it's like so often you get to somebody and they say, nobody can make money in permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:46">0:48:46-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  And then you point at Seth Holzer, what about that guy?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:48:52</a>:</strong>  He's probably bringing in like four million a year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:52">0:48:52-0:48:53</a>:</strong>  That doesn't...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:53">0:48:53-0:48:56</a>:</strong>  What, you think $4 million a year is like no money?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:56">0:48:56-0:48:57</a>:</strong>  Is that what you just said?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:57">0:48:57-0:48:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:58">0:48:58-0:48:59</a>:</strong>  He's in Austria.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:48:59">0:48:59-0:49:00</a>:</strong>  Really?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:00">0:49:00-0:49:04</a>:</strong>  And the top of the mountains too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:04">0:49:04-0:49:07</a>:</strong>  That's the best you got is because he's not in the United States, that it's impossible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:07">0:49:07-0:49:10</a>:</strong>  for anybody in the United States to make money with permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:10">0:49:10-0:49:18</a>:</strong>  The key is, is that this guy has been doing permaculture for so long and he's been doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:18">0:49:18-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  it whole hog.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:29</a>:</strong>  He's got like 70 ponds and he's got food just popping out of the ground everywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:29">0:49:29-0:49:32</a>:</strong>  And he finally got to the point like he's...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:32">0:49:32-0:49:40</a>:</strong>  Oh, the other thing is, is he's paid more agricultural fines than any other farmer in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:40">0:49:40-0:49:42</a>:</strong>  all of Europe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:50</a>:</strong>  And it's like, so basically the government is like just riding this guy's ass and making<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:50">0:49:50-0:49:51</a>:</strong>  him pay all these fines.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:51">0:49:51-0:49:53</a>:</strong>  But he's like, yeah, not a problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:53">0:49:53-0:49:54</a>:</strong>  I'll pay that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:54">0:49:54-0:49:58</a>:</strong>  Because he's making so much coin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:49:58">0:49:58-0:50:04</a>:</strong>  And they keep making laws specifically to shut him down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:04">0:50:04-0:50:10</a>:</strong>  So he finally gave up on selling seeds and then he stopped selling food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:10">0:50:10-0:50:12</a>:</strong>  But here's what he does.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:12">0:50:12-0:50:14</a>:</strong>  That's just astounding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:14">0:50:14-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  And it's kind of like, oh man, that is like three levels up from what any permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:21">0:50:21-0:50:23</a>:</strong>  person could even imagine doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:23">0:50:23-0:50:28</a>:</strong>  Because all these permaculture people are kind of like, and then I'm going to go into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:28">0:50:28-0:50:36</a>:</strong>  poverty for life with a CSA and I'll have a hundred clients that I'll sell food to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:36">0:50:36-0:50:41</a>:</strong>  And it's like, they kind of got this whole plan that's just doomed to poverty.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:41">0:50:41-0:50:54</a>:</strong>  And this guy has moved so many levels beyond anything like a CSA that now people pay 95<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:50:54">0:50:54-0:51:00</a>:</strong>  euros just to walk onto his land and he's got like a hundred people per day shelling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:00">0:51:00-0:51:02</a>:</strong>  out 95 euros.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:02">0:51:02-0:51:06</a>:</strong>  That adds up to like over a million dollars a year right there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:06">0:51:06-0:51:10</a>:</strong>  And the schedule is like, look, it's packed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:10">0:51:10-0:51:17</a>:</strong>  And it's like, so then the people come onto his land and they get a tour and then you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:17">0:51:17-0:51:21</a>:</strong>  believe they bring all these empty backpacks and then they leave.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:21">0:51:21-0:51:26</a>:</strong>  I think that they may have stolen some food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:26">0:51:26-0:51:31</a>:</strong>  And so then the thing is, is that the government is saying, okay, if you try to sell any food,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:31">0:51:31-0:51:35</a>:</strong>  we're going to regulate the hell out of you and tax you and all this stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:35">0:51:35-0:51:37</a>:</strong>  But he's not selling any food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:37">0:51:37-0:51:44</a>:</strong>  I mean, he's growing a lot of food and feeding a lot of people, but he's not selling it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:44">0:51:44-0:51:51</a>:</strong>  These people are just walking on for a tour and then it's like, okay, you guys show yourselves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:51">0:51:51-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  out now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:51:53</a>:</strong>  Bye.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:53">0:51:53-0:51:54</a>:</strong>  I'm going to go on to the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:54">0:51:54-0:51:55</a>:</strong>  I won't be looking at what you're stealing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:55">0:51:55-0:51:56</a>:</strong>  See ya.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:56">0:51:56-0:51:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that guy is so inspirational.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:57">0:51:57-0:51:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:51:58">0:51:58-0:52:09</a>:</strong>  We could do a whole podcast just on what we've kind of gleaned from his videos and from his<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:09">0:52:09-0:52:13</a>:</strong>  talks and from his books and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:13">0:52:13-0:52:17</a>:</strong>  So whenever somebody says it doesn't work or you can't make money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:17">0:52:17-0:52:21</a>:</strong>  He's the perfect one to point at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:21">0:52:21-0:52:24</a>:</strong>  You asked me what's his greatest achievement?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:24">0:52:24-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  That.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:32</a>:</strong>  Just the fact that we can point at him and say, look at that guy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:32">0:52:32-0:52:35</a>:</strong>  He did it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:35">0:52:35-0:52:43</a>:</strong>  And if you can't imagine how to get there after there's like five awesome videos and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:43">0:52:43-0:52:53</a>:</strong>  like three amazing books, and if you can't figure it out from point A to point B, then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:53">0:52:53-0:52:55</a>:</strong>  it's not Seth's problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:55">0:52:55-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  That's your problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:52:57</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:52:57">0:52:57-0:53:03</a>:</strong>  Now, you stated on your site that your consulting services are not a good fit for everybody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:03">0:53:03-0:53:09</a>:</strong>  because you focus heavily on making a net income in excess of like 200K annually, raising<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:09">0:53:09-0:53:14</a>:</strong>  animals, producing more than 90% of your own food and including the help of interns and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:14">0:53:14-0:53:15</a>:</strong>  volunteers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:15">0:53:15-0:53:19</a>:</strong>  I mean, obviously this is affected by some of the ambitions that this guy has instilled<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:19">0:53:19-0:53:22</a>:</strong>  in you and me and a lot of other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:22">0:53:22-0:53:27</a>:</strong>  Why are those some of your main priorities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:27">0:53:27-0:53:32</a>:</strong>  Whenever anybody wants me to come to their property and give them advice, there's two<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:32">0:53:32-0:53:33</a>:</strong>  important things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:33">0:53:33-0:53:39</a>:</strong>  One, you really don't want my advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:39">0:53:39-0:53:45</a>:</strong>  It's like, all I'm going to do is make you cry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:45">0:53:45-0:53:52</a>:</strong>  It's kind of like you need to find somebody who's going to say the things that you want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:52">0:53:52-0:53:53</a>:</strong>  to hear.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:53">0:53:53-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  I'm not going to say the things you want to hear.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:54:04</a>:</strong>  And it's like people seem to have a hard time understanding a lot of this stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:04">0:54:04-0:54:10</a>:</strong>  And it's like when Sep goes to a property, the owner will be sitting there saying, but,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:10">0:54:10-0:54:12</a>:</strong>  but, but, he waves them off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:12">0:54:12-0:54:15</a>:</strong>  He tells them to shut up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:15">0:54:15-0:54:20</a>:</strong>  He's like talking through an interpreter, but he just puts his hand like right in their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:20">0:54:20-0:54:23</a>:</strong>  face to tell them to shut up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:23">0:54:23-0:54:27</a>:</strong>  He doesn't want to hear their drivel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:27">0:54:27-0:54:28</a>:</strong>  And so he's awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:28">0:54:28-0:54:34</a>:</strong>  I mean, the thing is, is I've gone on so many different things with Sep and I've seen him<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:34">0:54:34-0:54:36</a>:</strong>  do it so many times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:36">0:54:36-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  It makes sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:43</a>:</strong>  A person is going to say, oh, I want Sep to come by and tell me magic things, but they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:43">0:54:43-0:54:46</a>:</strong>  really don't want to listen to Sep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:46">0:54:46-0:54:51</a>:</strong>  What they want is they want Sep to regurgitate their own ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:51">0:54:51-0:54:54</a>:</strong>  And Sep thinks their ideas are stupid.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:54:54">0:54:54-0:55:03</a>:</strong>  No, those ideas you have are horrible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:03">0:55:03-0:55:09</a>:</strong>  And you know, I don't think I'm at a level that Sep's at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:09">0:55:09-0:55:10</a>:</strong>  And I get it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:10">0:55:10-0:55:15</a>:</strong>  I list the ideas and then I'm going to have gals and I'm going to put them here and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:15">0:55:15-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  I'm going to, and it's kind of like their ideas are like so kindergarten.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:22">0:55:22-0:55:28</a>:</strong>  And it's like, no, this could be so much easier than what you're imagining.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:28">0:55:28-0:55:33</a>:</strong>  One time I went with Sep and we're looking at this property and this gal had a problem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:33">0:55:33-0:55:36</a>:</strong>  with blackberry vines.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:36">0:55:36-0:55:37</a>:</strong>  I don't know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:37">0:55:37-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  Have you ever been to the Pacific Northwest?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:41</a>:</strong>  Oh, that's where I did most of my schooling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:41">0:55:41-0:55:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:42">0:55:42-0:55:47</a>:</strong>  People have paid me a lot of money just to remove those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:47">0:55:47-0:55:52</a>:</strong>  So this woman had like, I think about 15 acres.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:52">0:55:52-0:55:58</a>:</strong>  And so what she did was, she just brought in a lot of goats and had them, just wouldn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:55:58">0:55:58-0:56:01</a>:</strong>  feed them until they ate all the blackberries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:01">0:56:01-0:56:04</a>:</strong>  And so she did, she got them to wipe them all out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:04">0:56:04-0:56:06</a>:</strong>  Sep was livid pissed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:06">0:56:06-0:56:13</a>:</strong>  He's like, so basically you tortured innocent animals instead of like finding a more efficient<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:13">0:56:13-0:56:15</a>:</strong>  way of doing this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:15">0:56:15-0:56:21</a>:</strong>  And then of course her whole property is like devoid of growth of anything except for trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:21">0:56:21-0:56:23</a>:</strong>  And all the trees have been girdled by the goats.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:23">0:56:23-0:56:31</a>:</strong>  In the meantime, the goats that are still there are living in kind of like a mud hole.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:31">0:56:31-0:56:32</a>:</strong>  It was a horrible thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:32">0:56:32-0:56:40</a>:</strong>  And Sep just couldn't stop talking about how much he hated this woman and what she's done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:40">0:56:40-0:56:47</a>:</strong>  And so, all right, so you're looking at the thing where I basically am trying to dissuade<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:47">0:56:47-0:56:51</a>:</strong>  people from having me be their consultant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:51">0:56:51-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  And now there have been a few people that have like listened to all of my podcasts and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:56:59</a>:</strong>  watched all of my videos.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:56:59">0:56:59-0:57:02</a>:</strong>  And so for those people, I don't mind going and being a consultant because they know what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:02">0:57:02-0:57:08</a>:</strong>  they're getting into and they know what I'm going to recommend and suggest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:08">0:57:08-0:57:13</a>:</strong>  And then I don't mind because it's like we speak the same language now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:13">0:57:13-0:57:17</a>:</strong>  They're familiar with all the things I'm going to say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:17">0:57:17-0:57:24</a>:</strong>  But so often it's like I get invited somewhere and I want to say catastrophe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:24">0:57:24-0:57:28</a>:</strong>  It's like, oh, praise the way I'm raising my chickens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:28">0:57:28-0:57:31</a>:</strong>  And it's like they've got them in a little coop and run.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:31">0:57:31-0:57:37</a>:</strong>  There's greenery in the coop and run, but just outside of the coop and run is a jungle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:37">0:57:37-0:57:42</a>:</strong>  of stuff that the chickens could like groove on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:42">0:57:42-0:57:51</a>:</strong>  And the ground level inside the coop is like four inches taller than outside the coop because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:51">0:57:51-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  they built it up with that much chicken shit over what, eight years or something?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:01</a>:</strong>  Chicken diseases are built up in that pad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:01">0:58:01-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  So these chickens and then the chickens are in constant shade.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:09</a>:</strong>  They don't get any sun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:09">0:58:09-0:58:14</a>:</strong>  So then I start ranting about their chickens and then they're like, get off my property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:14">0:58:14-0:58:17</a>:</strong>  I don't need to hear this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:17">0:58:17-0:58:20</a>:</strong>  And it's like, I don't need to have somebody give me a bunch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:20">0:58:20-0:58:22</a>:</strong>  Oh, that's the second thing too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:22">0:58:22-0:58:25</a>:</strong>  Earlier I said one step, there's two things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:25">0:58:25-0:58:28</a>:</strong>  One is people really don't want my advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:28">0:58:28-0:58:32</a>:</strong>  They think that they do, but really they do not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:32">0:58:32-0:58:36</a>:</strong>  And the second thing is pay me in advance because you're going to end up kicking me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:36">0:58:36-0:58:39</a>:</strong>  off of your land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:39">0:58:39-0:58:43</a>:</strong>  So for those people who have listened this far, have heard what you've had to say and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:43">0:58:43-0:58:46</a>:</strong>  still think your ideas are good, I'm on board with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:46">0:58:46-0:58:51</a>:</strong>  What are some of the methods that you coach people through to reach some of these lofty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:51">0:58:51-0:58:54</a>:</strong>  goals that you talk about?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:58:54">0:58:54-0:59:01</a>:</strong>  I would have to say, like, okay, here's an example that's not SEP, it's all me and it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:01">0:59:01-0:59:03</a>:</strong>  was done entirely over the phone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:03">0:59:03-0:59:06</a>:</strong>  And so it was a permaculture instructor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:06">0:59:06-0:59:13</a>:</strong>  The guy's taught a bunch of PDCs and he's like, okay, I'm on my way to the client's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:13">0:59:13-0:59:20</a>:</strong>  property and they have 200 acres and I've got a whole design I've put together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:20">0:59:20-0:59:24</a>:</strong>  And basically what I'm going to encourage them to do on this property is really awful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:24">0:59:24-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  soil, but it's flat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:25">0:59:25-0:59:27</a>:</strong>  It's a big flat place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:27">0:59:27-0:59:29</a>:</strong>  But the soil is really bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:29">0:59:29-0:59:34</a>:</strong>  Like weeds struggle to grow there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:34">0:59:34-0:59:46</a>:</strong>  And he says, I want them to grow alfalfa and sell alfalfa for the local people who have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:46">0:59:46-0:59:50</a>:</strong>  horses and feed them alfalfa.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:50">0:59:50-0:59:53</a>:</strong>  And I got really angry with this guy who's my friend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:53">0:59:53-0:59:56</a>:</strong>  I got angry at my friend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:56">0:59:56-0:59:59</a>:</strong>  Don't be my friend because I get extra angry at you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=0:59:59">0:59:59-1:00:05</a>:</strong>  And so I asked him some more about the property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:05">1:00:05-1:00:13</a>:</strong>  Well there's a house on the property and the guy that is the main guy that lives in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:13">1:00:13-1:00:20</a>:</strong>  house who's not the guy that you talk to because apparently he's a yogi or a guru or something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:20">1:00:20-1:00:21</a>:</strong>  like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:21">1:00:21-1:00:25</a>:</strong>  He's people all over the world think this guy is super cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:25">1:00:25-1:00:32</a>:</strong>  And it's like a 10 bedroom house and there's only like two people living in the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:32">1:00:32-1:00:38</a>:</strong>  And so the permaculture instructor guy is going to talk to the other person and show<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:38">1:00:38-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  the plans and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:45</a>:</strong>  The guru yogi guy is like meditating or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:45">1:00:45-1:00:52</a>:</strong>  And so the thing I said was, okay, here's what I want you to do is to take an acre,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:52">1:00:52-1:00:59</a>:</strong>  load it up with berms and hugelkultur and do a food forest and polycultures and grow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:00:59">1:00:59-1:01:04</a>:</strong>  food, grow lots and lots of food without irrigation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:04">1:01:04-1:01:08</a>:</strong>  And then next year take another acre and do that again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:08">1:01:08-1:01:13</a>:</strong>  And each year prep another acre like this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:13">1:01:13-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  The next thing to do is start renting out the rooms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:18">1:01:18-1:01:22</a>:</strong>  And so then you'll rent them out cheap in the beginning but there's people that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:22">1:01:22-1:01:25</a>:</strong>  going to come to this far, far away place in the middle of nowhere where the soil is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:25">1:01:25-1:01:30</a>:</strong>  terrible and they're going to want to bond with this guy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:30">1:01:30-1:01:34</a>:</strong>  And so then they'll rent the room for a certain period of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:34">1:01:34-1:01:38</a>:</strong>  And then rather than trying to sell the food that you're growing, which by the way, enters<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:38">1:01:38-1:01:45</a>:</strong>  you into a whole bunch of political nightmare stuff with trying to sell food, instead you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:45">1:01:45-1:01:50</a>:</strong>  just have somebody that's there that cooks food for whoever it is that happens to come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:50">1:01:50-1:01:51</a>:</strong>  by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:51">1:01:51-1:01:55</a>:</strong>  It's part of the thing for renting this room.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:01:55">1:01:55-1:02:06</a>:</strong>  And so the thing I suggested was is that you feed the people who come to see the yogi guy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:06">1:02:06-1:02:09</a>:</strong>  and that that's your business model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:09">1:02:09-1:02:18</a>:</strong>  And anyway, I think that in time as the years pass, you'll get more and more money per<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:18">1:02:18-1:02:25</a>:</strong>  night per room and you'll end up with far more than you could ever get selling hay or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:25">1:02:25-1:02:31</a>:</strong>  trying to sell this food directly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:31">1:02:31-1:02:34</a>:</strong>  I also think that the food that people would eat there, like they'll come to visit with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:34">1:02:34-1:02:42</a>:</strong>  this guy and they might leave feeling better because I believe that there's a lot of powerful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:42">1:02:42-1:02:48</a>:</strong>  healing properties in polyculture food that is not irrigated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:48">1:02:48-1:02:52</a>:</strong>  I think that that's the best food in the world for people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:52">1:02:52-1:02:55</a>:</strong>  Why is that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:02:55">1:02:55-1:03:00</a>:</strong>  Well, consider for a moment the carrot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:00">1:03:00-1:03:06</a>:</strong>  And so currently you go and you buy your organic carrots that were grown in a monocrop field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:06">1:03:06-1:03:08</a>:</strong>  They're organic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:08">1:03:08-1:03:12</a>:</strong>  And then somebody put manure on the field or possibly some minerals and stuff that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:12">1:03:12-1:03:18</a>:</strong>  the things that make carrots bright and look good and sellable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:18">1:03:18-1:03:26</a>:</strong>  And now each carrot plant as it grows, it has exudates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:26">1:03:26-1:03:31</a>:</strong>  And at the same time, the carrot roots go out and then they find things in the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:31">1:03:31-1:03:34</a>:</strong>  that they bring in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:34">1:03:34-1:03:38</a>:</strong>  Carrots were not designed to grow in a monocrop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:38">1:03:38-1:03:40</a>:</strong>  Carrots were designed to grow in a polyculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:40">1:03:40-1:03:47</a>:</strong>  And so then out there with a bunch of other plants, there's 50 other plants and there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:47">1:03:47-1:03:56</a>:</strong>  mycelium in an aged soil, then the carrots are getting a lot of the root exudates and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:03:56">1:03:56-1:04:03</a>:</strong>  a lot of the other exudates from all the other plants and that's its nutrition base.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:03">1:04:03-1:04:08</a>:</strong>  And a lot of these things are things that we haven't even figured out how to measure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:08">1:04:08-1:04:16</a>:</strong>  yet or that they even, we haven't even quantified or qualified them yet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:16">1:04:16-1:04:24</a>:</strong>  Then that carrot that grew up with 50 other plants is getting the nutrition that it needs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:24">1:04:24-1:04:32</a>:</strong>  according to nature's design as opposed to a field of monocrop where the only thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:32">1:04:32-1:04:38</a>:</strong>  available to it is carrot exudates from its neighbors, which it doesn't want because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:38">1:04:38-1:04:44</a>:</strong>  it's exuding the same thing, but whatever it is that somebody put into the soil because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:44">1:04:44-1:04:48</a>:</strong>  they read somewhere that that was good for carrots.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:48">1:04:48-1:04:53</a>:</strong>  So if I can understand you right, if I can narrow this down to a sound bite, it sounds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:53">1:04:53-1:04:59</a>:</strong>  like you're saying it takes a village to raise a carrot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:04:59">1:04:59-1:05:02</a>:</strong>  It takes diversity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:02">1:05:02-1:05:03</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:03">1:05:03-1:05:07</a>:</strong>  Now some grains are designed to grow in a monocrop, but even their monocrops aren't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:07">1:05:07-1:05:08</a>:</strong>  very monocroppy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:08">1:05:08-1:05:12</a>:</strong>  I mean they're still going to have a lot of other species growing in between them and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:12">1:05:12-1:05:17</a>:</strong>  typically they're still going to be growing on an aged soil that has mycelium and that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:17">1:05:17-1:05:26</a>:</strong>  soil is going to have soil structure, whereas the monocrop, especially with organic, I mean<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:26">1:05:26-1:05:33</a>:</strong>  with organic systems they till three times more often than with conventional systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:33">1:05:33-1:05:38</a>:</strong>  And so then they're going to, every time you till the soil you lose 30% of your organic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:38">1:05:38-1:05:44</a>:</strong>  matter, so you basically are growing these carrots in something that's closer to cement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:44">1:05:44-1:05:48</a>:</strong>  than soil and because it's been tilled so much there hasn't been a chance for very much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:48">1:05:48-1:05:51</a>:</strong>  mycelium to get started in the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:51">1:05:51-1:05:56</a>:</strong>  So it's like this nearly sterile soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:05:56">1:05:56-1:06:02</a>:</strong>  And take a look, a lot of people eat, they're like eating baby spinach, which is like the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:02">1:06:02-1:06:06</a>:</strong>  flavorless variety of spinach and it's like how did that get that way?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:06">1:06:06-1:06:11</a>:</strong>  Well it was grown in a hydroponic system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:11">1:06:11-1:06:15</a>:</strong>  But the spinach had water and whatever nutrients they put into the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:15">1:06:15-1:06:20</a>:</strong>  So sure it's labeled as organic but it's like, you know, it's...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:20">1:06:20-1:06:25</a>:</strong>  It really tells part of the story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:25">1:06:25-1:06:29</a>:</strong>  The key is it's not a polyculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:29">1:06:29-1:06:40</a>:</strong>  And it's not even soil and it's still a monocrop and it's often times a really artificial system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:40">1:06:40-1:06:43</a>:</strong>  And so then, but you know, people buy that and eat it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:43">1:06:43-1:06:45</a>:</strong>  It's like it says organic on it and spinach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:45">1:06:45-1:06:48</a>:</strong>  Hey, Popeye grooved on spinach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:48">1:06:48-1:06:49</a>:</strong>  Surely it's got to be good for you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:49">1:06:49-1:06:51</a>:</strong>  No, I'm right there with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:51">1:06:51-1:06:58</a>:</strong>  There's a big gap between I guess the ideals that a lot of people believe come along with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:06:58">1:06:58-1:07:05</a>:</strong>  that label organic and what the actual practice is and how similar or sometimes even worse<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:05">1:07:05-1:07:10</a>:</strong>  from conventional agriculture, industrial agriculture that it can be just behind a different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:10">1:07:10-1:07:11</a>:</strong>  label.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:11">1:07:11-1:07:18</a>:</strong>  Well, the good thing about organic is that it's at least a half-assed effort to have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:18">1:07:18-1:07:20</a>:</strong>  less toxins in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:20">1:07:20-1:07:24</a>:</strong>  Hey, and I'm all four steps in the right direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:24">1:07:24-1:07:30</a>:</strong>  But then the next, you know, when you go 10 levels up from that, then you start talking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:30">1:07:30-1:07:37</a>:</strong>  about permaculture and polyculture, now we're adding the nutrition back into that food because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:37">1:07:37-1:07:45</a>:</strong>  we're emulating nature as opposed to this very artificial way of growing food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:45">1:07:45-1:07:46</a>:</strong>  That's very well said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:46">1:07:46-1:07:47</a>:</strong>  I appreciate that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:47">1:07:47-1:07:52</a>:</strong>  Now since you have your finger on the pulse of this permaculture and natural building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:52">1:07:52-1:07:57</a>:</strong>  world between the experiments that you're doing and everything on the forums, do you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:07:57">1:07:57-1:08:02</a>:</strong>  have any predictions or innovations or discoveries that are going to start to shape the future<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:02">1:08:02-1:08:06</a>:</strong>  of these two practices?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:06">1:08:06-1:08:07</a>:</strong>  Wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:07">1:08:07-1:08:08</a>:</strong>  Wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:08">1:08:08-1:08:10</a>:</strong>  Predictions about the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:10">1:08:10-1:08:11</a>:</strong>  Come on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:11">1:08:11-1:08:14</a>:</strong>  Tell me what's the next big thing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:14">1:08:14-1:08:24</a>:</strong>  I mean, I want to fill this space with what my fantasies are as opposed to my Nostradamus<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:24">1:08:24-1:08:25</a>:</strong>  stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:25">1:08:25-1:08:26</a>:</strong>  Well, give me both then.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:26">1:08:26-1:08:30</a>:</strong>  Let's hear the optimistic version and then what you think is going to happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:30">1:08:30-1:08:36</a>:</strong>  I tell you, my crystal ball has a big crack in it so it's no good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:36">1:08:36-1:08:43</a>:</strong>  But I believe, in fact, here at my place, we've been here three years and I like to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:43">1:08:43-1:08:51</a>:</strong>  think that by the time we get to 10 years that you can take somebody who has cancer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:51">1:08:51-1:08:56</a>:</strong>  and they're told you have one week left to live, we give up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:08:56">1:08:56-1:09:05</a>:</strong>  I like to think that we will bring that person here and then their cancer will just go away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:05">1:09:05-1:09:06</a>:</strong>  That is ambitious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:06">1:09:06-1:09:07</a>:</strong>  I like it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:07">1:09:07-1:09:12</a>:</strong>  Because I really believe I've got a crazy theory.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:12">1:09:12-1:09:16</a>:</strong>  Now you might want to put on your tinfoil hat here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:16">1:09:16-1:09:17</a>:</strong>  That's good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:17">1:09:17-1:09:18</a>:</strong>  I know you're good for this stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:18">1:09:18-1:09:19</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:19">1:09:19-1:09:21</a>:</strong>  So here's my crazy theory.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:21">1:09:21-1:09:25</a>:</strong>  I think that cancer comes from carcinogens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:25">1:09:25-1:09:28</a>:</strong>  I know it's nuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:28">1:09:28-1:09:30</a>:</strong>  It's nuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:30">1:09:30-1:09:33</a>:</strong>  Most people believe that cancer comes from the cancer fairy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:33">1:09:33-1:09:41</a>:</strong>  This little invisible being that floats around and goes, ding, you get cancer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:41">1:09:41-1:09:42</a>:</strong>  That's where it comes from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:42">1:09:42-1:09:49</a>:</strong>  You find out somebody's got cancer and they're saying, oh, that's too bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:49">1:09:49-1:09:50</a>:</strong>  That's terrible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:50">1:09:50-1:09:52</a>:</strong>  The fairy got you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:52">1:09:52-1:09:55</a>:</strong>  That sucks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:09:55">1:09:55-1:10:00</a>:</strong>  As opposed to the question that I would ask is, what have you been poisoning yourself<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:00">1:10:00-1:10:02</a>:</strong>  with?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:02">1:10:02-1:10:04</a>:</strong>  Which I think is fairly accurate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:04">1:10:04-1:10:12</a>:</strong>  I believe, to expand on that a little bit, I believe that cancer comes from carcinogens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:12">1:10:12-1:10:20</a>:</strong>  that we know of and that we don't yet know about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:20">1:10:20-1:10:25</a>:</strong>  So while everybody's kind of like, I've been drinking out of this plastic all my life and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:25">1:10:25-1:10:28</a>:</strong>  now I find out it's got BPA in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:28">1:10:28-1:10:35</a>:</strong>  So I threw that out the window where I throw all my garbage and I got this new plastic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:35">1:10:35-1:10:38</a>:</strong>  thing and it says right on it, doesn't have the BPA on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:38">1:10:38-1:10:44</a>:</strong>  And it's been like, I can't help but think that it's got something worse than BPA in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:44">1:10:44-1:10:45</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:45">1:10:45-1:10:50</a>:</strong>  And as soon as the government catches onto it, they'll just switch it to something else<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:50">1:10:50-1:10:54</a>:</strong>  that the government hasn't investigated yet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:10:54">1:10:54-1:11:04</a>:</strong>  And so I kind of got this crazy idea that our world is loaded with toxins and carcinogens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:04">1:11:04-1:11:10</a>:</strong>  and natural building combined with permaculture techniques.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:10">1:11:10-1:11:18</a>:</strong>  I think that this is going to be the end solution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:18">1:11:18-1:11:25</a>:</strong>  And I guess I should qualify that as I fantasize.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:25">1:11:25-1:11:33</a>:</strong>  I'm not really sure where we're going to end up but I do believe that we're going to change<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:33">1:11:33-1:11:39</a>:</strong>  the way that people eat food and we're going to change the way that we approach toxicity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:39">1:11:39-1:11:43</a>:</strong>  And I love the idea that it's kind of like somebody's seriously ill.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:43">1:11:43-1:11:46</a>:</strong>  Maybe it's not even cancer, maybe it's something else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:46">1:11:46-1:11:48</a>:</strong>  Unexplained they can't figure it out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:48">1:11:48-1:11:56</a>:</strong>  I mean it was 12 years ago that I was bonkers about permaculture and I realized I had to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:11:56">1:11:56-1:12:02</a>:</strong>  quit my day job and go down the path that I'm on now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:02">1:12:02-1:12:12</a>:</strong>  And during that period of time, a woman was telling me about how her husband has some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:12">1:12:12-1:12:18</a>:</strong>  intestinal disease that the doctors can't figure out and he's only got six weeks left<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:18">1:12:18-1:12:20</a>:</strong>  to live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:20">1:12:20-1:12:25</a>:</strong>  And for whatever reason, he's never been to Europe so they decided to go to Europe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:25">1:12:25-1:12:30</a>:</strong>  He goes to Europe and his disease mysteriously goes away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:30">1:12:30-1:12:34</a>:</strong>  For two weeks it's just gone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:34">1:12:34-1:12:39</a>:</strong>  He lives large, he eats whatever he wants, everything is wonderful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:39">1:12:39-1:12:45</a>:</strong>  Then he comes back to the United States and he has the disease again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:45">1:12:45-1:12:49</a>:</strong>  So what is it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:49">1:12:49-1:12:54</a>:</strong>  What's making that dude sick that isn't over in Europe?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:12:54">1:12:54-1:13:00</a>:</strong>  I think that this is going to be what a lot of this is about and I love the idea of building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:00">1:13:00-1:13:07</a>:</strong>  something with natural building that's very, very, very clean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:07">1:13:07-1:13:10</a>:</strong>  It's very, very, very natural.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:10">1:13:10-1:13:15</a>:</strong>  Several orders of magnitude beyond what most people consider natural building and that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:15">1:13:15-1:13:21</a>:</strong>  the only food is stuff that we've grown in polycultures with permaculture systems and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:21">1:13:21-1:13:28</a>:</strong>  then if somebody's riddled with some disease they can come here and I'm going to fantasize<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:28">1:13:28-1:13:31</a>:</strong>  that they're diseased.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:31">1:13:31-1:13:36</a>:</strong>  I like it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:36">1:13:36-1:13:41</a>:</strong>  Those are some heavy ambitions but it's a unique approach and it's going to take a whole<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:41">1:13:41-1:13:48</a>:</strong>  lot of more experimentation and innovation which will keep your Wheaton Labs running<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:48">1:13:48-1:13:51</a>:</strong>  for a long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:51">1:13:51-1:13:57</a>:</strong>  Well they do something like this over at Sep's place right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:13:57">1:13:57-1:14:02</a>:</strong>  People are going there that don't understand permaculture or natural building or any of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:02">1:14:02-1:14:03</a>:</strong>  that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:03">1:14:03-1:14:14</a>:</strong>  They're going there and they say that he has, what do you call it, the water of life?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:14">1:14:14-1:14:17</a>:</strong>  The spring of youth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:17">1:14:17-1:14:23</a>:</strong>  The spring of life or the spring of youth?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:23">1:14:23-1:14:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:25">1:14:25-1:14:31</a>:</strong>  So there's people from all over the world that are going there just to drink the water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:31">1:14:31-1:14:39</a>:</strong>  because they believe that it heals everything and it's magical.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:39">1:14:39-1:14:46</a>:</strong>  And I mean Sep's a businessman.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:46">1:14:46-1:14:48</a>:</strong>  He's not going to correct them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:48">1:14:48-1:14:50</a>:</strong>  I don't think he advertises that at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:14:50">1:14:50-1:15:00</a>:</strong>  That's just entirely, but here in Montana a woman had been there and drank the water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:00">1:15:00-1:15:11</a>:</strong>  and she was convinced that it was like this magical water and she hired Sep to come here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:11">1:15:11-1:15:19</a>:</strong>  to Montana and put these water systems into her property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:19">1:15:19-1:15:25</a>:</strong>  And so she thought, oh the fountain of youth, that's what it is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:25">1:15:25-1:15:34</a>:</strong>  And so I remember that when Sep was done and he had left and there was all this big equipment,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:34">1:15:34-1:15:39</a>:</strong>  still all these earth movers and stuff like that still shaping the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:39">1:15:39-1:15:45</a>:</strong>  I remember I found the woman sitting on a pile of mud and I asked her, so what do you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:45">1:15:45-1:15:46</a>:</strong>  think?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:46">1:15:46-1:15:53</a>:</strong>  And she said, I wanted the fountain of youth, I paid for the fountain of youth, what I got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:53">1:15:53-1:15:57</a>:</strong>  was instant farm and I don't want to be a farmer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:15:57">1:15:57-1:16:02</a>:</strong>  What did you think was going to happen hiring Sep?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:02">1:16:02-1:16:06</a>:</strong>  Well yeah that's what I explained to her and I said, so let me see if I can kind of come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:06">1:16:06-1:16:08</a>:</strong>  up with an analogy here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:08">1:16:08-1:16:19</a>:</strong>  So you've looked at Sep's paintings and all of his paintings are nudes and then people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:19">1:16:19-1:16:23</a>:</strong>  think that there's a different aesthetic to all these nudes and you even looked at some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:23">1:16:23-1:16:29</a>:</strong>  of the nudes and you saw a painting of space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:29">1:16:29-1:16:37</a>:</strong>  And so then you hired him to paint a painting for you and you were very emphatic that what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:37">1:16:37-1:16:45</a>:</strong>  you wanted was something with planets and quasars and nebulas and stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:45">1:16:45-1:16:51</a>:</strong>  So he painted a nude that had all of that in it and you're pissed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:51">1:16:51-1:16:57</a>:</strong>  It's like this is what he does, this is where it comes from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:16:57">1:16:57-1:17:03</a>:</strong>  You get the fountain of youth, you get the water of life, you get all of that with instant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:03">1:17:03-1:17:04</a>:</strong>  farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:04">1:17:04-1:17:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it sounds like she didn't lose, she just didn't get what she was originally thinking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:11">1:17:11-1:17:19</a>:</strong>  Right exactly and you know what, that's exactly why I don't want people to hire me as a consultant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:19">1:17:19-1:17:25</a>:</strong>  Just think about it, she's all dreamy about how Sep's going to come and she doesn't know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:25">1:17:25-1:17:33</a>:</strong>  what he's going to do but it's going to be awesome by her standards of what is awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:33">1:17:33-1:17:41</a>:</strong>  But what Sep did is he came and he made something that was awesome by Sep's standards of awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:41">1:17:41-1:17:45</a>:</strong>  I get to a property and they want me to give advice and it's like yeah but we're going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:45">1:17:45-1:17:55</a>:</strong>  to torture our chickens forever and what we want you to do is stop talking about how to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:55">1:17:55-1:17:57</a>:</strong>  raise chickens a different way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:17:57">1:17:57-1:18:02</a>:</strong>  What we want you to do and what we're paying you to do is to tell us how awesome we are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:02">1:18:02-1:18:06</a>:</strong>  with raising chickens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:06">1:18:06-1:18:10</a>:</strong>  And of course what I'm thinking is you're torturing these poor chickens, they're suffering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:10">1:18:10-1:18:12</a>:</strong>  under your care.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:12">1:18:12-1:18:17</a>:</strong>  It's that whole thing of like we must be awesome at raising chickens because most of them haven't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:17">1:18:17-1:18:18</a>:</strong>  died.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:18">1:18:18-1:18:28</a>:</strong>  You know and it's like that's a terrible metric, that's an awful metric.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:28">1:18:28-1:18:30</a>:</strong>  Yeah I hear you man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:30">1:18:30-1:18:36</a>:</strong>  Well hey before I let you go here can you make sure that everybody knows the best ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:36">1:18:36-1:18:44</a>:</strong>  to get in contact either with you or interact with the site or I know you've got a DVD set<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:44">1:18:44-1:18:46</a>:</strong>  for the Rocket Mass Heaters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:46">1:18:46-1:18:52</a>:</strong>  So we have eight DVDs about Rocket Mass Heaters, the four old ones which were just video of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:52">1:18:52-1:18:59</a>:</strong>  a workshop and then the four new ones that are like a dozen different events all packed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:18:59">1:18:59-1:19:02</a>:</strong>  into four DVDs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:02">1:19:02-1:19:04</a>:</strong>  Far more information rich now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:04">1:19:04-1:19:08</a>:</strong>  And then we've got a three DVD set that's called World Domination Gardening which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:08">1:19:08-1:19:11</a>:</strong>  about Earthworks stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:11">1:19:11-1:19:17</a>:</strong>  And then we did the Permaculture Playing Cards which it's like everybody buys them by the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:17">1:19:17-1:19:20</a>:</strong>  dozen at Christmas time to put into people's stockings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:20">1:19:20-1:19:26</a>:</strong>  The cards were designed so that way if your bonkers about permaculture but your friends<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:26">1:19:26-1:19:32</a>:</strong>  and family think you're nuts then what you do is you give this to them for Christmas<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:32">1:19:32-1:19:38</a>:</strong>  and we tried to design it so that if they actually open it and look at the cards then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:38">1:19:38-1:19:41</a>:</strong>  they'll think that you're less nuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:41">1:19:41-1:19:42</a>:</strong>  Interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:42">1:19:42-1:19:46</a>:</strong>  This was our mission.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:46">1:19:46-1:19:50</a>:</strong>  I've had some people confirm that it worked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:50">1:19:50-1:19:51</a>:</strong>  That is intriguing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:51">1:19:51-1:19:53</a>:</strong>  Yeah we've sold a lot of cards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:53">1:19:53-1:19:54</a>:</strong>  I can imagine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:54">1:19:54-1:19:59</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of permies that are like I need my family to think that I'm not nuts anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:19:59">1:19:59-1:20:00</a>:</strong>  Well there you go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:00">1:20:00-1:20:05</a>:</strong>  Those are the Permaculture Playing Cards to bridge the gap between you and your more conservative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:05">1:20:05-1:20:06</a>:</strong>  family members.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:06">1:20:06-1:20:08</a>:</strong>  There's all of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:08">1:20:08-1:20:15</a>:</strong>  We've got the podcast, the YouTube videos, articles and then of course the forums have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:15">1:20:15-1:20:28</a>:</strong>  1.2 million people per month and 22 million page views so a lot of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:28">1:20:28-1:20:30</a>:</strong>  It sounds like I asked the wrong question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:30">1:20:30-1:20:33</a>:</strong>  I should have asked how can people avoid your stuff?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:33">1:20:33-1:20:35</a>:</strong>  That seems like a harder job.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:35">1:20:35-1:20:40</a>:</strong>  It does seem like if you search for a lot of permaculture stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:40">1:20:40-1:20:45</a>:</strong>  Yeah so there you have it like anywhere you look on the web at this point you're going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:45">1:20:45-1:20:53</a>:</strong>  to through some web end up at one of Paul Wheaton's either DVDs, websites or other materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:53">1:20:53-1:20:56</a>:</strong>  So thank you so much for giving me your time today Paul.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/episode-003-paul-wheaton/#t=1:20:57">1:20:57-1:20:59</a>:</strong>  I'm going to have to do this again sometime.<br />
