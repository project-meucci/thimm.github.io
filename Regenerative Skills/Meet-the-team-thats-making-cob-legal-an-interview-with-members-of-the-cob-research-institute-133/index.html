<p><strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:13</a>:</strong>  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:13">0:00:13-0:00:17</a>:</strong>  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:17">0:00:17-0:00:22</a>:</strong>  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:22">0:00:22-0:00:25</a>:</strong>  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:25">0:00:25-0:00:29</a>:</strong>  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:29">0:00:29-0:00:31</a>:</strong>  next episode, so let's jump right in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:00:59">0:00:59-0:01:21</a>:</strong>  Alright, now today's episode is very important in that there's a limited window of time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:21">0:01:21-0:01:26</a>:</strong>  for those of you, especially in the USA, who care about natural building and want to see<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:26">0:01:26-0:01:32</a>:</strong>  COB and other natural building materials legalized and approved by building authorities to help<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:32">0:01:32-0:01:33</a>:</strong>  this to happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:33">0:01:33-0:01:37</a>:</strong>  An incredible opportunity is coming up in the last week of October, which is just over<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:37">0:01:37-0:01:42</a>:</strong>  a week from now, when members of the COB Research Institute, some of whom you'll hear interviewed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:42">0:01:42-0:01:48</a>:</strong>  in a minute, will present a proposal for COB to be included in the ICC IRC Code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:48">0:01:48-0:01:53</a>:</strong>  Now that's the International Code Council International Residential Code, the governing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:53">0:01:53-0:01:57</a>:</strong>  body for building standards across the whole country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:01:57">0:01:57-0:02:01</a>:</strong>  So to gain approval, the proposal will need to be voted on, and this is where you come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:01">0:02:01-0:02:02</a>:</strong>  in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:02">0:02:02-0:02:06</a>:</strong>  This is your chance to call your local fire marshal or building inspector and voice your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:06">0:02:06-0:02:11</a>:</strong>  support that they vote to approve this measure, which would allow legal, permitted COB buildings<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:11">0:02:11-0:02:13</a>:</strong>  in the USA.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:13">0:02:13-0:02:17</a>:</strong>  Now you might be new to natural building, or you might think that you'd never want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:17">0:02:17-0:02:23</a>:</strong>  a COB house yourself, but if this proposal passes, it's likely to have a ripple effect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:23">0:02:23-0:02:27</a>:</strong>  for the approval of other earthen building materials and alternative building methods<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:27">0:02:27-0:02:29</a>:</strong>  in the future for everyone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:29">0:02:29-0:02:34</a>:</strong>  The guys from the CRI will give more details about how you can help to support this initiative,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:34">0:02:34-0:02:39</a>:</strong>  but if this is all you have time to listen to, just know that you can go to COBCODE.ORG<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:39">0:02:39-0:02:44</a>:</strong>  and get specific instructions on how to contact your local building official directly, or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:44">0:02:44-0:02:48</a>:</strong>  to put them in contact with the CRI to help get out the vote on this potentially historic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:48">0:02:48-0:02:52</a>:</strong>  advancement for earthen and natural building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:52">0:02:52-0:02:55</a>:</strong>  So don't hesitate, like I mentioned, the vote will take place during the last week<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:55">0:02:55-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  of October, this month, 2019.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:04</a>:</strong>  So in this interview I got to speak with John Fordyce, Martin Hammer, and Anthony Dente,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:04">0:03:04-0:03:09</a>:</strong>  who have been working for years to compile the data and engineering properties of COB<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:09">0:03:09-0:03:13</a>:</strong>  in order to better understand the material and write the proposal to have it approved<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:13">0:03:13-0:03:17</a>:</strong>  as a legal building material in the US.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:17">0:03:17-0:03:21</a>:</strong>  Between them they answered a lot of questions about the advantages and limitations of COB,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:21">0:03:21-0:03:26</a>:</strong>  the tests and simulations they've done to get proper measurements of its performance,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:26">0:03:26-0:03:30</a>:</strong>  and what they recommend to builders who are considering using COB to build their homes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:30">0:03:30-0:03:35</a>:</strong>  It was such a pleasure for a natural building nerd like me to get to talk to these guys<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:35">0:03:35-0:03:39</a>:</strong>  who've worked so hard to get verifiable information on the material that got me to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:39">0:03:39-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  fall in love with earthen building in the first place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:48</a>:</strong>  So from here I'll hand it over to the team from the COB Research Institute.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:48">0:03:48-0:03:50</a>:</strong>  Gentlemen thank you all for being with me today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:50">0:03:50-0:03:54</a>:</strong>  It's such a pleasure to have three of you representing the COB Research Institute all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:54">0:03:54-0:03:55</a>:</strong>  at once.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:03:55">0:03:55-0:04:01</a>:</strong>  We've got a lot of material to get through today as there's an important date approaching.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:06</a>:</strong>  So before we jump into the questions, why don't we give a quick introduction to everybody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:06">0:04:06-0:04:10</a>:</strong>  sitting with us here and a little bit about your background and your position with the<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:15">0:04:15-0:04:17</a>:</strong>  Hi, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:17">0:04:17-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  This is John Fordyce and I'm basically the director of the COB Research Institute.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:35</a>:</strong>  My history is I'm an architect and experienced cobbler and those two professional things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:35">0:04:35-0:04:41</a>:</strong>  led me to the creation of the COB Research Institute.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:41">0:04:41-0:04:44</a>:</strong>  Marvelous Martin, why don't you introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:44">0:04:44-0:04:45</a>:</strong>  background.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:45">0:04:45-0:04:46</a>:</strong>  Thanks, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:46">0:04:46-0:04:53</a>:</strong>  I'm an architect with the private practice in the San Francisco Bay Area for over 30<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:53">0:04:53-0:04:54</a>:</strong>  years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:04:54">0:04:54-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  And I've been involved in sustainable construction for my entire career, with an emphasis on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:02">0:05:02-0:05:03</a>:</strong>  straw bale construction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:10</a>:</strong>  And that got me into code development about 20, almost 20 years ago now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:10">0:05:10-0:05:21</a>:</strong>  So I've been lead author or co-author of a number of appendices in national model building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:21">0:05:21-0:05:26</a>:</strong>  codes, including this most recent proposal on cob construction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:26">0:05:26-0:05:27</a>:</strong>  Marvelous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:27">0:05:27-0:05:28</a>:</strong>  Thank you, Martin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:28">0:05:28-0:05:35</a>:</strong>  And I'm an advisor to the COB Research Institute, specifically around the code development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:35">0:05:35-0:05:36</a>:</strong>  Great.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:41</a>:</strong>  Hello, my name is Anthony Dente.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:41">0:05:41-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  I'm a licensed civil engineer in the state of California.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:50</a>:</strong>  I'm a principal and owner of urgent structural engineers and I'm a board member on the COB<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:50">0:05:50-0:05:53</a>:</strong>  Research Institute and the lead engineer for the organization.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:53">0:05:53-0:05:54</a>:</strong>  Marvelous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:54">0:05:54-0:05:58</a>:</strong>  Well, gentlemen, thank you all for taking the time to be with me today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:05:58">0:05:58-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  And we're here gathered kind of for a specific purpose this time around.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:08</a>:</strong>  There's an important date approaching, as I mentioned earlier, and there are some proposed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:08">0:06:08-0:06:15</a>:</strong>  changes to the COB code that could go into effect based on the activity and the votes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:15">0:06:15-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  of people in the area of California.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:22</a>:</strong>  And before we get into more detail about this important date and what listeners can do to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:22">0:06:22-0:06:29</a>:</strong>  help make this happen, let's start with the very beginning and get people sort of comfortable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:29">0:06:29-0:06:34</a>:</strong>  with this material that we're talking about so that they understand what the importance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:34">0:06:34-0:06:36</a>:</strong>  is to begin with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:36">0:06:36-0:06:39</a>:</strong>  So let's start by asking, what is COB?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:39">0:06:39-0:06:44</a>:</strong>  I've written articles about this myself, which are posted on the website, but straight from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:44">0:06:44-0:06:51</a>:</strong>  the people who have worked with it as a building material and its engineering properties.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:51">0:06:51-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  John, could you start by telling us what is COB?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:54">0:06:54-0:06:59</a>:</strong>  What can it be done for buildings and sort of what advantages it has over other more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:06:59">0:06:59-0:07:01</a>:</strong>  conventional building materials?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:01">0:07:01-0:07:04</a>:</strong>  Sure, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:04">0:07:04-0:07:12</a>:</strong>  Basically COB is a mixture of earth, sand, and straw with water, which is used to create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:12">0:07:12-0:07:20</a>:</strong>  a plastic earth and mixture that is then used to build walls.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:20">0:07:20-0:07:29</a>:</strong>  And the advantages of that is that it's a highly sustainable way of building and it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:29">0:07:29-0:07:35</a>:</strong>  uses locally sourced materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:35">0:07:35-0:07:39</a>:</strong>  The mixture is like Adobe, but we don't make bricks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:39">0:07:39-0:07:52</a>:</strong>  We just stack it up in layers on top of a foundation and a stem wall to create the walls.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:07:52">0:07:52-0:08:03</a>:</strong>  The layers are interpenetrated so that we actually achieve a monolithic construction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:03">0:08:03-0:08:07</a>:</strong>  rather than mortar bricks like Adobe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:07">0:08:07-0:08:11</a>:</strong>  And it's just done as a sequence of stacking up the layers, letting them dry, and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:11">0:08:11-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  adding more layers as the building progresses in height.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  And as I mentioned, the wall is protected from ground moisture by a stem wall and a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:32</a>:</strong>  foundation and those are either concrete or stone, mortared stone or broken concrete urbanite.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:32">0:08:32-0:08:41</a>:</strong>  And then in the construction of the wall, originally it did not include reinforcing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:41">0:08:41-0:08:49</a>:</strong>  that was provided by the straw, but now for what we've been doing, we've actually included<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:49">0:08:49-0:08:57</a>:</strong>  actual reinforcing in the wall because it's needed for seismic strength.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:08:57">0:08:57-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  And the rest of the building is basically standard construction that is in the roof<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:08</a>:</strong>  as wood and all the other elements are basically standard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:08">0:09:08-0:09:15</a>:</strong>  And the advantages of Cobb is that it's low cost, low material cost, got a low carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:15">0:09:15-0:09:17</a>:</strong>  footprint.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:17">0:09:17-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  The technique is very simple and it's really friendly to owner builders and that can remove<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:30</a>:</strong>  with owner builder, remove the labor costs, which can be as much as two thirds of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:30">0:09:30-0:09:33</a>:</strong>  cost of a building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:33">0:09:33-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  And the beauty of it is that it allows non-rectilinear designs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:51</a>:</strong>  And for me personally, this is a cure to what I call Cartesian madness where we live in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:51">0:09:51-0:09:58</a>:</strong>  a world that is basically dominated by rectilinear construction and that affects our thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:09:58">0:09:58-0:10:05</a>:</strong>  and cultural habits and so Cobb makes possible a change from that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:05">0:10:05-0:10:08</a>:</strong>  So those are the advantages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:08">0:10:08-0:10:13</a>:</strong>  Could you also tell us a brief history about how this became used as a building material<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:13">0:10:13-0:10:19</a>:</strong>  and especially in the western United States where its implementation is fairly recent?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:19">0:10:19-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  Well, the earliest evidence of Cobb is lost in antiquity because it erodes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:38</a>:</strong>  And so the most recent archeological evidence is the 11th century in Africa.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:38">0:10:38-0:10:44</a>:</strong>  And then we know that it's been used in Europe since about the 12th century and there are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:44">0:10:44-0:10:53</a>:</strong>  many forms in Europe, the Middle East and Asia and that by the 15th century, it was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:10:53">0:10:53-0:11:06</a>:</strong>  a normal part of construction in the UK, United Kingdom, England and then it was widely used<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:06">0:11:06-0:11:10</a>:</strong>  by the 19th century.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:10">0:11:10-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  The use of Cobb declined with the 1800s industrial and transportation revolution and then with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:26</a>:</strong>  the development of building codes in the 1800s, Cobb was not included and so its use became<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:26">0:11:26-0:11:28</a>:</strong>  prevented.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:28">0:11:28-0:11:34</a>:</strong>  And the traditions then for construction died out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:34">0:11:34-0:11:42</a>:</strong>  Then there's been a resurgence of it in the 1900s in the United Kingdom and in about the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:42">0:11:42-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  1990s, an organization called the Cobb Cottage Company brought Cobb to North America and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:59</a>:</strong>  they developed the early Oregon Cobb techniques and which is the basis of what we're using<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:11:59">0:11:59-0:12:02</a>:</strong>  in the code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:02">0:12:02-0:12:11</a>:</strong>  And I guess that aside from the development of the Cobb Oregon techniques, Cobb got spread<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:11">0:12:11-0:12:20</a>:</strong>  in North America by Cobb Cottage Company workshops and it gained popularity due to low cost and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:20">0:12:20-0:12:23</a>:</strong>  owner builder appeal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:23">0:12:23-0:12:30</a>:</strong>  But because there is no code for Cobb in North America or the United States, it resulted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:38</a>:</strong>  in outlaw building and that's where we are now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:38">0:12:38-0:12:44</a>:</strong>  We're attempting to solve this by creating a Cobb code to make it possible for Cobb to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:44">0:12:44-0:12:47</a>:</strong>  be built legally where otherwise it stopped.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:47">0:12:47-0:12:53</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's remarkable for me to hear the history of this building material kind of summed up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:53">0:12:53-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  because especially the last part of what you were talking about, about how the Cobb Cottage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:13:03</a>:</strong>  Company sort of revived a version of this building material recently is pretty close<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:03">0:13:03-0:13:08</a>:</strong>  to my own experience since that's the company and those are the people who I apprenticed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:08">0:13:08-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  with to start learning natural building myself and have since taken it to a lot of other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:14</a>:</strong>  places around the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:14">0:13:14-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  You know, though it seems like such an ideal building material for many different applications,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:25</a>:</strong>  it's like you said, still not legal to build this way within the United States.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:25">0:13:25-0:13:30</a>:</strong>  Martin, could you talk a little bit about the current state of Cobb in the United States<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:30">0:13:30-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  and sort of how it's regarded or classified in the building world?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  Thanks Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:45</a>:</strong>  Well as John and you just described, when Cobb as a material and building system was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:45">0:13:45-0:13:53</a>:</strong>  brought to the US, it came from primarily the area of the UK and other parts of Europe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:53">0:13:53-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  that are not subject to earthquakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  So that transition created some problems because those centuries of use and the building systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:20</a>:</strong>  developed there didn't have to, weren't confronted with these what are called lateral loads,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:20">0:14:20-0:14:26</a>:</strong>  lateral forces that are imposed on buildings from earthquakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:26">0:14:26-0:14:32</a>:</strong>  And the material and system when it came to North America was primarily used in some of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:32">0:14:32-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  the western states, especially Oregon and parts of Northern California.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:48</a>:</strong>  So that was terrific that this really wonderful material and system migrated to the west coast<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:48">0:14:48-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  of the United States, but there were some inadvertent consequences of that, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:15:05</a>:</strong>  there was incomplete or very well an absence of understanding of how this material and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:05">0:15:05-0:15:14</a>:</strong>  this building system performs when subject to moderate to high earthquake loads.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:14">0:15:14-0:15:24</a>:</strong>  Building in what we believe are some unsafe buildings in the western United States.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:24">0:15:24-0:15:34</a>:</strong>  We don't know the extent of that right now because there haven't been very few moderate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:34">0:15:34-0:15:44</a>:</strong>  or high magnitude earthquakes in these buildings that have been subjected to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:44">0:15:44-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  So what we're going to find out eventually, because in the western states we know that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  high magnitude earthquakes will occur eventually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:12</a>:</strong>  But we in testing, there's a lot of the Cobb Research Institute has facilitated testing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:12">0:16:12-0:16:17</a>:</strong>  for this exact purpose to understand the capacity of Cobb wall systems with different types<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:17">0:16:17-0:16:26</a>:</strong>  of reinforcing, including no steel reinforcing, just using the straw itself as the reinforcing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:31</a>:</strong>  in the wall, but also with steel reinforcing and Anthony Dentis will talk a little bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:31">0:16:31-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  more about this later.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  But as John mentioned, because there is no Cobb code, not only in the west coast of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:48</a>:</strong>  US, but anywhere in the United States, one of a few things happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:48">0:16:48-0:16:54</a>:</strong>  People when they find out about that and the difficulty, not impossibility because there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:54">0:16:54-0:16:59</a>:</strong>  have been some permitted buildings, permitted Cobb buildings, just a few, and Anthony has<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:16:59">0:16:59-0:17:02</a>:</strong>  been involved in those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:02">0:17:02-0:17:09</a>:</strong>  But when they find out the difficulty and at the time and cost involved in getting a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:09">0:17:09-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  permitted Cobb building constructed, they do one of a couple of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:25</a>:</strong>  They don't build with Cobb or as John mentioned, they'll build an unpermitted building that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:25">0:17:25-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  could be unsafe because there's no inspection process or plan review.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:39</a>:</strong>  And then sometimes if buildings are built without a permit, that building is discovered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:39">0:17:39-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  later on by a building official or a neighbor and that causes a huge problem for the building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:56</a>:</strong>  owner because in one case in particular, in the San Francisco area where an unpermitted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:17:56">0:17:56-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  Cobb building was discovered and that owner had to go through very challenging process<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:12</a>:</strong>  of having the building made seismically safe as a retrofit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:12">0:18:12-0:18:22</a>:</strong>  So that's for all those reasons, having a Cobb code is very important for anyone who's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:22">0:18:22-0:18:30</a>:</strong>  interested in building with this earthen building system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:30">0:18:30-0:18:37</a>:</strong>  And I also want to mention one other, earlier John was talking about, you asked and John<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:37">0:18:37-0:18:40</a>:</strong>  was talking about the advantages of Cobb.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:40">0:18:40-0:18:46</a>:</strong>  One important advantage that he didn't mention is that Cobb as an earthen building system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:46">0:18:46-0:18:49</a>:</strong>  is highly fire resistant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:49">0:18:49-0:18:54</a>:</strong>  It's been used for centuries in kilns and ovens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:18:54">0:18:54-0:19:00</a>:</strong>  That's a testament to how well it performs in fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:00">0:19:00-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  It contains fire in kilns and ovens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:12</a>:</strong>  And that's especially important in western states in the U.S. that have been subject<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:12">0:19:12-0:19:16</a>:</strong>  to increased intensity and frequency of wildfires.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:16">0:19:16-0:19:23</a>:</strong>  So rather than building with wood frame, which is the predominant residential method of construction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:23">0:19:23-0:19:35</a>:</strong>  in the U.S., especially after a wildfire, some which have decimated entire cities in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:35">0:19:35-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  California in particular, that rather than build with wood again, a highly combustible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:53</a>:</strong>  material and system using an earthen system like Cobb makes a lot of sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:53">0:19:53-0:19:57</a>:</strong>  So along those lines, I know you mentioned that people would either be deterred from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:19:57">0:19:57-0:20:03</a>:</strong>  building with Cobb at all, or perhaps just build unpermitted structures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:03">0:20:03-0:20:08</a>:</strong>  And I'm wondering if, since so many people have gone ahead and built without permits,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:08">0:20:08-0:20:12</a>:</strong>  I've been involved in some of those projects myself during my education and workshops along<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:12">0:20:12-0:20:13</a>:</strong>  this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:13">0:20:13-0:20:20</a>:</strong>  And it seems like there's sort of a counterculture that tends to use this material at the moment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:20">0:20:20-0:20:27</a>:</strong>  and may not want to have this come into government hands where there would be tight regulations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:27">0:20:27-0:20:34</a>:</strong>  and dictations about how they can or cannot continue to construct with earthen materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:34">0:20:34-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  What would be the incentive for those people who are kind of on the fringes of what's allowed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:49</a>:</strong>  by building already to get involved with perhaps a more oversight of their projects?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:49">0:20:49-0:20:51</a>:</strong>  That's a good question, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:51">0:20:51-0:20:58</a>:</strong>  And there are pros and cons, one could say, about a building system or material being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:20:58">0:20:58-0:21:00</a>:</strong>  governed by building codes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:00">0:21:00-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  But in my experience, the advantages far outweigh the disadvantages of having a code-approved<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:12</a>:</strong>  building system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:12">0:21:12-0:21:21</a>:</strong>  For one, in code development, the codes are vetted through a process, through an open<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:21">0:21:21-0:21:28</a>:</strong>  process, and there's input from many knowledgeable design and building professionals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:28">0:21:28-0:21:33</a>:</strong>  So it ensures that safe construction will occur.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:33">0:21:33-0:21:41</a>:</strong>  So I mentioned that earlier that we know of or are fairly sure there are a number of what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:41">0:21:41-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  we would consider unsafe buildings that have been built and have dotted the landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:52</a>:</strong>  So that's one important advantage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:21:52">0:21:52-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  There are others, well, people, if you're building a structure to know that it's unpermitted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:12</a>:</strong>  and maybe if you want to use the term illegal, but let's say at least unpermitted, just the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:12">0:22:12-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  anxiety that that may cause an owner, that the building may be discovered and have to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:19</a>:</strong>  be torn down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:19">0:22:19-0:22:25</a>:</strong>  There are buildings that have been discovered and were required, forced to be removed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:25">0:22:25-0:22:30</a>:</strong>  So just removing that anxiety from a homeowner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:30">0:22:30-0:22:45</a>:</strong>  But there are other important issues too, like insurance or potentially if a home loan<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:45">0:22:45-0:22:47</a>:</strong>  was required.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:47">0:22:47-0:22:56</a>:</strong>  So the lending industry and the insurance industry are very averse to the construction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:56">0:22:56-0:22:59</a>:</strong>  of non-permitted and non-code approved buildings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:22:59">0:22:59-0:23:03</a>:</strong>  Anthony, do you have something you'd like to add to that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:03">0:23:03-0:23:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I have a lot of experience of performing structural observations and assessments of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:09">0:23:09-0:23:12</a>:</strong>  existing structures, non-permitted cob structures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:12">0:23:12-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  And there's two points that I think are important to the question you asked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:26</a>:</strong>  One is that it's easy to look at the building codes as a quote unquote bad guy or a bureaucratic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:26">0:23:26-0:23:32</a>:</strong>  system trying to rain down and tamp good ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:32">0:23:32-0:23:41</a>:</strong>  Though there are, as Martin said, a lot of benefits to the building code and oversight<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:41">0:23:41-0:23:44</a>:</strong>  on all aspects of construction is one of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:44">0:23:44-0:23:50</a>:</strong>  One thing I find the most is that these unpermitted cob buildings are often built by high quality<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:50">0:23:50-0:23:54</a>:</strong>  cob practitioners in many cases.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:23:54">0:23:54-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  Though because the craft of these builders tends to be cob, they aren't as educated in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:08</a>:</strong>  foundation, roof connection, roof diaphragm, which is the earthquake system that helps<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:08">0:24:08-0:24:14</a>:</strong>  connect the top of the building together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:14">0:24:14-0:24:21</a>:</strong>  Building these aspects of the building can be quite simple and not that expensive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:21">0:24:21-0:24:30</a>:</strong>  But when you're not kind of forced to look at the literature on those topics, you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:30">0:24:30-0:24:32</a>:</strong>  easily miss one step or two steps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:32">0:24:32-0:24:36</a>:</strong>  And in structural engineering, we talk constantly about load path.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:36">0:24:36-0:24:40</a>:</strong>  And when one link in the chain of load path is disconnected, that load's not going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:40">0:24:40-0:24:43</a>:</strong>  make it down to the ground where you want it to rest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:43">0:24:43-0:24:48</a>:</strong>  And I think the other important point to your question is that just because there may be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:48">0:24:48-0:24:54</a>:</strong>  a building code for a material, it doesn't mean that people who maybe would have gotten<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:24:54">0:24:54-0:25:00</a>:</strong>  away with building without a permit before can't still attempt to take that route.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:00">0:25:00-0:25:09</a>:</strong>  It's illegal in most places around where I practice, but people still build illegal or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:09">0:25:09-0:25:13</a>:</strong>  unpermitted wood structures or other materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:13">0:25:13-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  So this wouldn't stop people from doing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:24</a>:</strong>  It would just make a widely open the door for those who are prohibited from building,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:24">0:25:24-0:25:30</a>:</strong>  whether it's insurance or whether it's legality or just concern for safety.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  And I would imagine too that having COB just as a general building material, not having<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:42</a>:</strong>  a way to or a path towards legalization or permitting is probably holding it back quite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:42">0:25:42-0:25:50</a>:</strong>  a bit from innovation and continuing to improve because much like medical marijuana was a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:50">0:25:50-0:25:57</a>:</strong>  handful of years ago, for a lack of access, not only for use, but also for study, is going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:25:57">0:25:57-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  to hold it back from advancing along with the rest of the technologies that we use for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:02">0:26:02-0:26:03</a>:</strong>  building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:03">0:26:03-0:26:08</a>:</strong>  And as a couple of you have mentioned already, the applications are extremely relevant to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:08">0:26:08-0:26:15</a>:</strong>  the context, especially where you guys are in California with seismic issues, with forest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:15">0:26:15-0:26:16</a>:</strong>  fire issues.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:16">0:26:16-0:26:21</a>:</strong>  And the fact that this could potentially perform much better than what is already on the books<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:21">0:26:21-0:26:27</a>:</strong>  means that there's a lot of potential for where this could go if legalized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:27">0:26:27-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  Now along those lines, let's switch gears for just a second and talk about how the COB<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:38</a>:</strong>  Research Institute comes in and the type of work that you have done collectively, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:38">0:26:38-0:26:43</a>:</strong>  I know there's a larger team behind this as well, in order to try and study this material<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:43">0:26:43-0:26:49</a>:</strong>  in order to get the engineering specs and the information needed to bring it to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:49">0:26:49-0:26:50</a>:</strong>  coding and permitting bodies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:50">0:26:50-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  John do you want to take it from here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:26:58</a>:</strong>  That's a big question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:26:58">0:26:58-0:27:03</a>:</strong>  Basically what we've been able to accomplish so far, once we learned to function as an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:03">0:27:03-0:27:12</a>:</strong>  organization, we have been conducting tests.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:12">0:27:12-0:27:22</a>:</strong>  We did tests with the Santa Clara University, with Quail Springs in permaculture, and that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:22">0:27:22-0:27:26</a>:</strong>  was Anthony doing out of plane testing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:26">0:27:26-0:27:30</a>:</strong>  And then we did some thermal testing to establish the R-value.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:30">0:27:30-0:27:40</a>:</strong>  So all of these tests have given us enough information to begin to write the code, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:40">0:27:40-0:27:45</a>:</strong>  once we get the code accepted, then we will have accomplished a great deal of what we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:45">0:27:45-0:27:53</a>:</strong>  need to do, but we won't be stopping there because one of the things that we've discovered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:53">0:27:53-0:27:58</a>:</strong>  in the process of writing the code is that there's a lot of information that we still<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:27:58">0:27:58-0:28:07</a>:</strong>  don't know, and so there's going to be additional research that is needed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:07">0:28:07-0:28:13</a>:</strong>  So we're part way there, but we have a long ways to go still.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:13">0:28:13-0:28:19</a>:</strong>  So like you said, this is a much larger topic because so many different tests and analysis<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:19">0:28:19-0:28:24</a>:</strong>  need to be done on this material, and many of which are still to come.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:24">0:28:24-0:28:29</a>:</strong>  Tell me a little bit about the necessities of the material to be accepted, starting with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:29">0:28:29-0:28:34</a>:</strong>  the structural necessity, how it can bear weight.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:34">0:28:34-0:28:40</a>:</strong>  How have you been able to test the structural stability of COP?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:40">0:28:40-0:28:46</a>:</strong>  We've had the opportunity to work with a number of different universities, and there's also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:46">0:28:46-0:28:55</a>:</strong>  testing bodies and university members, graduate students beyond CRI that are doing and have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:55">0:28:55-0:28:59</a>:</strong>  done quality testing, though the total volume is still quite low.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:28:59">0:28:59-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  It's not a proprietary product or it's quite difficult to make into a proprietary product,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:12</a>:</strong>  so the funding for research is low, and therefore there is a small amount of it because of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:12">0:29:12-0:29:19</a>:</strong>  And though we've had a great opportunity to work with the University of San Francisco,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:19">0:29:19-0:29:25</a>:</strong>  the University of Santa Clara, Cal Polytechnic University in San Luis Obispo, California,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:25">0:29:25-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  and we've conducted both small-scale batch tests and also full-scale in-plane, out-of-plane<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:33">0:29:33-0:29:36</a>:</strong>  loading tests.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:36">0:29:36-0:29:42</a>:</strong>  To answer your question specifically about gravity loads, this is the material's strongest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:42">0:29:42-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  suit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:50</a>:</strong>  It's a compression-based material quite akin to concrete, and its strength is in compression<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:50">0:29:50-0:29:56</a>:</strong>  and there is a reinforcement mechanism added to it to increase its tensile strength to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:29:56">0:29:56-0:30:00</a>:</strong>  allow it to bend and move in other ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:00">0:30:00-0:30:10</a>:</strong>  Though we find consistently that it's almost difficult to reach – slenderness is an issue,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:10">0:30:10-0:30:17</a>:</strong>  and we could get quite involved in talking about the slenderness limitations of COB,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:17">0:30:17-0:30:25</a>:</strong>  though right now, the way the research stands, we strongly recommend four-foot wall sections<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:25">0:30:25-0:30:33</a>:</strong>  and minimum thickness based on height, which is contained in the code, though if – once<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:33">0:30:33-0:30:41</a>:</strong>  you're – those recommendations are not just involved with compression loading.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:41">0:30:41-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  There's lateral loading consideration in those recommendations as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:50</a>:</strong>  And it's normally when you're considering all the actions of the building, compression<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:50">0:30:50-0:30:54</a>:</strong>  is not where the material is tending to fail.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:54">0:30:54-0:30:58</a>:</strong>  It's because it's compression-based, it's bending capabilities that are limiting it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:30:58">0:30:58-0:31:02</a>:</strong>  – limiting its function.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:02">0:31:02-0:31:06</a>:</strong>  So what is that addition that is being put in the walls to increase the tensile strength<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:06">0:31:06-0:31:08</a>:</strong>  of the material?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:08">0:31:08-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  That's a good question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:11">0:31:11-0:31:17</a>:</strong>  Marty spoke to this, and so did John a little bit earlier, but the natural form of the material,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:17">0:31:17-0:31:24</a>:</strong>  the base form of the material, uses straw as a biofiber micro-reinforcing system, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:24">0:31:24-0:31:33</a>:</strong>  the concrete – codified concrete construction has a microfiber reinforcing option.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:33">0:31:33-0:31:38</a>:</strong>  They typically use metal microfibers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:38">0:31:38-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  Here we're obviously using a agricultural product as the microfiber, but as we all know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:50</a>:</strong>  straw has tensile capability, and as some of us know but others may not know, clay is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:50">0:31:50-0:31:55</a>:</strong>  a magical material that wicks water away from most other things it's in contact with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:31:55">0:31:55-0:32:02</a>:</strong>  So we've had the privilege of being present when 100-plus-year-old cob buildings have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:06</a>:</strong>  been opened up for various reasons, and you see the straw looks like it was picked the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:06">0:32:06-0:32:08</a>:</strong>  day prior.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:08">0:32:08-0:32:14</a>:</strong>  It keeps its material integrity, and so that tensile micro-reinforcing capacity that it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:14">0:32:14-0:32:19</a>:</strong>  offering stays present throughout the building's life because of that function.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:19">0:32:19-0:32:25</a>:</strong>  That being said, we have found, especially in high-seismic zones, that a stronger reinforcing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:25">0:32:25-0:32:35</a>:</strong>  system is required in most locations that we design in on the western states, and so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:35">0:32:35-0:32:40</a>:</strong>  other forms of reinforcing, steel reinforcing, we're finding that mesh reinforcing systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:40">0:32:40-0:32:49</a>:</strong>  mimic the distribution matrix of the straw and the general low strength of the material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:49">0:32:49-0:32:56</a>:</strong>  Cob is low strength, but the walls are large, so when we use steel meshes, they interact<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:32:56">0:32:56-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  the best, and whether that's horizontal or vertical mesh, depending on what your objective<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:06</a>:</strong>  is or what your primary problem is for the shape of your building and its location, we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:06">0:33:06-0:33:12</a>:</strong>  finding that you get a lot of bang for your buck when you make simple steps of adding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:12">0:33:12-0:33:19</a>:</strong>  the right kind of reinforcing, non-straw steel or other forms of reinforcing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:19">0:33:19-0:33:24</a>:</strong>  Like you said, this is probably key in areas with bigger seismic loads or the danger of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:24">0:33:24-0:33:26</a>:</strong>  really hard shearing winds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:26">0:33:26-0:33:30</a>:</strong>  Let's talk about some of the other properties that have been noted as an advantage to cob<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:30">0:33:30-0:33:35</a>:</strong>  as well, specifically its inability to burn as a non-combustible material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:35">0:33:35-0:33:39</a>:</strong>  Tell me where that comes in and how you've been able to measure that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:39">0:33:39-0:33:48</a>:</strong>  So yes, as I mentioned earlier, and you also, Oliver, that is one of cob's strengths, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:48">0:33:48-0:33:58</a>:</strong>  high resistance to fire, and there have been tests in different parts of the world, some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:33:58">0:33:58-0:34:09</a>:</strong>  in Australia come to mind, on either cob or similar materials like adobe or other earthen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:09">0:34:09-0:34:12</a>:</strong>  materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:12">0:34:12-0:34:16</a>:</strong>  So there's, well, and there's lots of anecdotal evidence.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:16">0:34:16-0:34:27</a>:</strong>  There was a, there have been many bushfires in central Australia over recent decades,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:27">0:34:27-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  catastrophic fires, not unlike some of the ones that have been experienced in the western<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:40</a>:</strong>  US recently, where all buildings have been destroyed, all wood buildings have been destroyed,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:40">0:34:40-0:34:48</a>:</strong>  but where a cob or more often an adobe structure, other earthen structure has been subjected<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:48">0:34:48-0:34:55</a>:</strong>  to the same fire, it's the only building or building element that is left standing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:55">0:34:55-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  Everything else is incinerated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:35:05</a>:</strong>  So we have anecdotal evidence such as the performance in actual fires and some testing,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:05">0:35:05-0:35:19</a>:</strong>  some done to rigorous testing standards, but there hasn't been a complete fire test for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:19">0:35:19-0:35:26</a>:</strong>  a cob wall that any of us are aware of, we don't think it exists.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:26">0:35:26-0:35:35</a>:</strong>  And in the process of developing or going through the code development process, there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:35">0:35:35-0:35:43</a>:</strong>  are some, there are rigorous or explicit standards or testing standards that are required in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:43">0:35:43-0:35:50</a>:</strong>  order to assign, for example, what's known as a fire resistance rating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:50">0:35:50-0:35:56</a>:</strong>  So there are different lengths of time, one hour, two hour, four hour, for example, where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:35:56">0:35:56-0:36:04</a>:</strong>  the assembly, the wall assembly passes a certain test.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:04">0:36:04-0:36:12</a>:</strong>  And so because that test hasn't been performed and that test, that type of test is quite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:12">0:36:12-0:36:21</a>:</strong>  expensive, in the code proposal that CRI recently submitted in the International Code Council<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:21">0:36:21-0:36:35</a>:</strong>  process, we proposed a one hour fire resistance rating for a cob wall, which is very conservative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:35">0:36:35-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  to what we expect or know from other, from some of the partial testing, I'll call it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:54</a>:</strong>  And that was, an analysis was performed by a fire science engineer and university professor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:36:54">0:36:54-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  So we had it quite well analyzed and made what we thought was a reasonable proposal,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  but because of the strictness of the code requirements for the testing, that assigned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:27</a>:</strong>  fire resistance rating was either the primary or maybe even the sole reason that our code<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:27">0:37:27-0:37:33</a>:</strong>  proposal in May was recently disapproved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:33">0:37:33-0:37:39</a>:</strong>  There's another code hearing coming up at the end of the month, which you alluded to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:39">0:37:39-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  in the beginning of the program.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  And that's, so we've made revisions to the code proposal to remove that one hour fire<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:51">0:37:51-0:37:52</a>:</strong>  resistance rating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:52">0:37:52-0:37:59</a>:</strong>  So it's, so we expect with that change, there's a good chance that the code proposal will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:37:59">0:37:59-0:38:03</a>:</strong>  be approved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:03">0:38:03-0:38:11</a>:</strong>  And even without that fire resistance rating, the COB code that's been considered is still<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:11">0:38:11-0:38:17</a>:</strong>  very useful because in most residential construction, there is no fire resistance rating required.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:17">0:38:17-0:38:22</a>:</strong>  It's only when a building is very close to the property line, for example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:22">0:38:22-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  So it's still a very valid proposal, but it's also ironic that we, this revised proposal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  includes no fire resistance rating for a wall system that we know is highly fire resistant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:43</a>:</strong>  And so, but that is something that we plan, that CRI plans to do in the near future to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:43">0:38:43-0:38:53</a>:</strong>  subject a cob wall to one of these ASTM is the testing body or underwriter's laboratory<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:38:53">0:38:53-0:39:01</a>:</strong>  is another one that we could do, but subject it to a test, subject to us obtaining the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:01">0:39:01-0:39:07</a>:</strong>  funding for it and find out exactly how fire resistant a cob wall is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:07">0:39:07-0:39:13</a>:</strong>  But we're expecting a very high rating, probably at least a four hour rating, which is quite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:13">0:39:13-0:39:14</a>:</strong>  high.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:14">0:39:14-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  And it's not, it wouldn't be surprising because it's a non combustible wall system, but it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  is a part of the test is also it being subjected to a fire hose, but has to withstand that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:35</a>:</strong>  impact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:35">0:39:35-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  And that's why these tests are required because we all want to be sure that these building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:45</a>:</strong>  systems are safe in these conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:45">0:39:45-0:39:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah, of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:47">0:39:47-0:39:52</a>:</strong>  It's funny though, that the area in which it's likely to perform the best is the one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:52">0:39:52-0:39:54</a>:</strong>  that has held it back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:54">0:39:54-0:39:59</a>:</strong>  When there are other things that, you know, are a little bit more difficult to test.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:39:59">0:39:59-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  Like you said, these are all made of non combustible materials, so it should perform just fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  Now let's talk about one of the areas in which it gets a little bit more complicated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:15</a>:</strong>  In the regions that we've been talking about the seismic danger, the fire danger are prevalent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:15">0:40:15-0:40:22</a>:</strong>  But for example, where I grew up in Minnesota, it's much more of an issue of thermal or insulative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:22">0:40:22-0:40:25</a>:</strong>  properties of the wall system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:25">0:40:25-0:40:32</a>:</strong>  Now John, would you like to talk a little bit about how cob performs as a thermal structure?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:32">0:40:32-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  Because it's not as simple as many people are familiar thinking about it as insulation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  It works as a thermal mass and that comes with its own complications.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:44</a>:</strong>  Could you explain that a little?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:44">0:40:44-0:40:53</a>:</strong>  So thermal performance is a function of two things, mass and thermal resistance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:53">0:40:53-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  So cob is terrific in terms of its mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:00</a>:</strong>  It's a high mass wall system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:00">0:41:00-0:41:05</a>:</strong>  It's not very good in terms of thermal resistance for the same reason.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:05">0:41:05-0:41:06</a>:</strong>  It's a very dense material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:06">0:41:06-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  It does have straw in it, which has good resistance actually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:20</a>:</strong>  Straw bales walls, for example, are highly of great thermal resistance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:20">0:41:20-0:41:32</a>:</strong>  But overall, the matrix is dominated by the mass and so it's challenging in terms of being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:32">0:41:32-0:41:35</a>:</strong>  a good thermal resistant wall system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:35">0:41:35-0:41:41</a>:</strong>  And it's challenged in meeting building code requirements, existing building code requirements<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:41">0:41:41-0:41:46</a>:</strong>  in virtually every state, especially in the colder climates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:46">0:41:46-0:41:54</a>:</strong>  You mentioned Minnesota, where the mass is more important in hotter climates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:54">0:41:54-0:41:58</a>:</strong>  It does have some value in colder climates as well, but it's thermal resistance that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:41:58">0:41:58-0:42:00</a>:</strong>  most important in the colder climates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:00">0:42:00-0:42:11</a>:</strong>  So in the code proposal, the cob wall is designated as what's called a mass wall system and that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:19</a>:</strong>  good because it thereby has lower thermal resistance requirements.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:19">0:42:19-0:42:22</a>:</strong>  But it's still challenging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:22">0:42:22-0:42:27</a>:</strong>  Other mass wall systems have a similar challenge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:27">0:42:27-0:42:31</a>:</strong>  Historic wall systems are concrete or concrete block.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:31">0:42:31-0:42:36</a>:</strong>  Even log homes are considered mass wall system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:36">0:42:36-0:42:42</a>:</strong>  They all have the same challenge or other earthen wall systems like rammed earth or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:42">0:42:42-0:42:46</a>:</strong>  Adobe or earth bag.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:46">0:42:46-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  So one solution is to add insulation to the exterior of the building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:51">0:42:51-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  And even wood frame buildings, that's being done quite a bit recently to improve the thermal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  resistance of a wood frame structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:01</a>:</strong>  And there are different ways to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:01">0:43:01-0:43:08</a>:</strong>  And there are some materials that would be especially appropriate for a cob wall that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:08">0:43:08-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  are more environmentally friendly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  So there's rock wall insulation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:21</a>:</strong>  Or there's some cellulose-based insulation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:21">0:43:21-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  A new generation of insulation boards that are not petrochemical products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  So there are possibilities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:30">0:43:30-0:43:36</a>:</strong>  But that's something we're just getting into exploring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:36">0:43:36-0:43:41</a>:</strong>  And that is allowed in the way the code proposal is written.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:41">0:43:41-0:43:45</a>:</strong>  That type of solution is allowed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:45">0:43:45-0:43:52</a>:</strong>  Another possibility is to change the mix of the cob itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:52">0:43:52-0:43:55</a>:</strong>  So maybe more straw.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:55">0:43:55-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  Or to change the aggregate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  So instead of sand, use other types of aggregates that have better insulating value like lava<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:03">0:44:03-0:44:07</a>:</strong>  rock or pumice or perlite.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:07">0:44:07-0:44:15</a>:</strong>  So John, maybe John, if you could speak to that a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:15">0:44:15-0:44:19</a>:</strong>  You've been working with that very recently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:19">0:44:19-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, I just started some samples to be used with various mixtures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  The materials you just mentioned, lighter weight aggregates to basically lower the density<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:39">0:44:39-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  of the cob and thereby improve the thermal resistance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:56</a>:</strong>  And as is the case with the other tests such as thermal, this testing is pretty expensive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:44:56">0:44:56-0:45:02</a>:</strong>  And so we're kind of on hold with it at the moment because we just don't have the funding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:02">0:45:02-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  to pursue it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:15</a>:</strong>  I know that there is in England, the University of Plymouth has been doing experiments with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:15">0:45:15-0:45:20</a>:</strong>  a project called Cob Barge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:20">0:45:20-0:45:30</a>:</strong>  Barge being the French word for cob and to increase thermal resistance of cob walls.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:30">0:45:30-0:45:39</a>:</strong>  And I'm looking forward to seeing what they're going to propose or will have come up with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:39">0:45:39-0:45:46</a>:</strong>  their testing to see if there's any of that stuff that we can use in future work with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:46">0:45:46-0:45:54</a>:</strong>  the RCRI code work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:54">0:45:54-0:45:56</a>:</strong>  We just have to wait and see at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:56">0:45:56-0:45:57</a>:</strong>  Fair enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:45:57">0:45:57-0:46:00</a>:</strong>  And I was actually wondering because you guys have done some great work and research along<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:00">0:46:00-0:46:04</a>:</strong>  these lines, but I've also seen some advancements from other organizations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:04">0:46:04-0:46:07</a>:</strong>  I'm glad you brought up Cob Barge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:07">0:46:07-0:46:11</a>:</strong>  I've seen a lot of the experiments that they've done in controlled environments, the data<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:11">0:46:11-0:46:13</a>:</strong>  that they've been getting from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:13">0:46:13-0:46:19</a>:</strong>  I know that certain seismic tests were done on a small cob building up in Vancouver, Canada<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:19">0:46:19-0:46:20</a>:</strong>  a while ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:20">0:46:20-0:46:25</a>:</strong>  Do you get this kind of information from a wide variety of sources or do you try and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:25">0:46:25-0:46:33</a>:</strong>  just simulate some of these tests in house in order to comply to what is needed by these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:33">0:46:33-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  coding bodies?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:41</a>:</strong>  Yes, we do our best to cast as wide a net as possible when gathering information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:41">0:46:41-0:46:47</a>:</strong>  Any testing that's been done worldwide on the material is valuable to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:47">0:46:47-0:46:53</a>:</strong>  We find because there's a lot of complications with testing this material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:53">0:46:53-0:46:59</a>:</strong>  The samples appear to prefer to be slightly larger than concrete samples.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:46:59">0:46:59-0:47:02</a>:</strong>  The full-scale samples can be incredibly heavy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:02">0:47:02-0:47:07</a>:</strong>  A seven by seven wall system can be between 5,000, 7,000 pounds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:07">0:47:07-0:47:13</a>:</strong>  Moving that around in a university setting or a testing lab setting can be very difficult.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:13">0:47:13-0:47:18</a>:</strong>  Bringing quality practitioners to the site to build a material that only is lifted eight<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:29</a>:</strong>  I bring up these complications because most tests of the less than 20 major structural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:29">0:47:29-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  tests that we've collected, you mentioned the British Columbia tests that they ran.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  Unfortunately they never produced a report for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:47:44</a>:</strong>  In Sydney, Australia, they ran another shake table test, though unfortunately the shake<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:44">0:47:44-0:47:54</a>:</strong>  table was not able to shake to the magnitude of failure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:47:54">0:47:54-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  As we learn as a community, a global community about testing COB, we learn learning what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  not to do is as important as getting values.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:05">0:48:05-0:48:06</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of that too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:06">0:48:06-0:48:11</a>:</strong>  Though John, I don't know if he wants to speak to this, but conducted a very wide search<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:11">0:48:11-0:48:16</a>:</strong>  for information all across the globe in an attempt to write a white paper on the current<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:16">0:48:16-0:48:19</a>:</strong>  state of all research on all topics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:19">0:48:19-0:48:22</a>:</strong>  That proved to be very, very helpful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:22">0:48:22-0:48:27</a>:</strong>  That was over, I don't know, the past four or five years that went on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:27">0:48:27-0:48:30</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's an ongoing project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:30">0:48:30-0:48:37</a>:</strong>  I have a whole list of papers that I still need to go through.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:37">0:48:37-0:48:44</a>:</strong>  As Anthony said, we did gain a lot of information from the original part of the COB technical<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:44">0:48:44-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  white paper research, but it is still ongoing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:54</a>:</strong>  And so with all of this information as it's being presented to the permitting bodies,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:48:54">0:48:54-0:49:00</a>:</strong>  what would change for people who have either built with COB in the past or learned it through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:00">0:49:00-0:49:03</a>:</strong>  sort of informal methods, much like I have?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:03">0:49:03-0:49:10</a>:</strong>  I know, Anthony, you had mentioned changes into what is recommended, things like perhaps<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:10">0:49:10-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  four foot wall sections.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  I couldn't understand if that was a thickness rating or if that was a general size that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:18</a>:</strong>  you had used for testing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:18">0:49:18-0:49:24</a>:</strong>  How does this differ from perhaps what the prevailing knowledge around COB building currently<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:24">0:49:24-0:49:25</a>:</strong>  is?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:25">0:49:25-0:49:27</a>:</strong>  Yes, I'm happy to speak to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:27">0:49:27-0:49:34</a>:</strong>  The prevailing knowledge on COB building varies quite widely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:34">0:49:34-0:49:40</a>:</strong>  In New Zealand, they have what we consider the most robust earthen building standards<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:40">0:49:40-0:49:41</a>:</strong>  nationally recognized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:41">0:49:41-0:49:45</a>:</strong>  They're also a seismically active country and English speaking, which is beneficial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:45">0:49:45-0:49:49</a>:</strong>  to us in the Western United States.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:49">0:49:49-0:49:55</a>:</strong>  There's also been an ASTM standard written on earthen wall construction, which mostly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:55">0:49:55-0:49:59</a>:</strong>  followed a lot of the same guidelines as the New Zealand code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:49:59">0:49:59-0:50:07</a>:</strong>  And then there are many, many, some permitted but mostly unpermitted structures across the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:07">0:50:07-0:50:13</a>:</strong>  Western United States and across the globe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:13">0:50:13-0:50:22</a>:</strong>  Though I bring up all three of those because you will find every shape, size, format of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:22">0:50:22-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  wall lineup, of wall sizing, of window spacing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  Having very large window cavities with very thin columns of straw only COB is not advisable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:40">0:50:40-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  This is something that you do see in practice and that is a detail that the code and people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:50">0:50:50-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  with current knowledge of testing and of building standards with the material would highly recommend<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:51:07</a>:</strong>  against in any environment, but especially in seismic environments and high wind environments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:07">0:51:07-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  Foundations are another part of the structure that are often built not to current code standards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:24</a>:</strong>  I believe there's a lot of potential for research on this topic of exploring ways to make moisture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:24">0:51:24-0:51:31</a>:</strong>  proof environmentally sustaining foundation isolating basis for COB structures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:31">0:51:31-0:51:39</a>:</strong>  Though currently in the United States, the prevailing permittable foundation system is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:39">0:51:39-0:51:41</a>:</strong>  a concrete foundation system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:41">0:51:41-0:51:49</a>:</strong>  We work closely with trying to intensely decrease carbon input into our concrete mixes here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:49">0:51:49-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  at our office.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:51:56</a>:</strong>  As you know, concrete can be quite carbon intensive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:51:56">0:51:56-0:52:01</a>:</strong>  And there's a number of other little bells and whistles, connections to roof diaphragms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:01">0:52:01-0:52:04</a>:</strong>  How are you anchoring to the top of your wall?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:04">0:52:04-0:52:07</a>:</strong>  How is that connected to your roof rafters?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:07">0:52:07-0:52:13</a>:</strong>  Metal clips, just metal clips connecting those pieces together can add a continuity to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:13">0:52:13-0:52:19</a>:</strong>  building that keeps one side of the building far more securely attached to the other side<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:19">0:52:19-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  of the building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  And that can be really helpful, but not always done in practice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:30</a>:</strong>  And Oliver, this is Martin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:30">0:52:30-0:52:32</a>:</strong>  Very good description from Anthony.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:32">0:52:32-0:52:37</a>:</strong>  And I'm glad he mentioned the New Zealand standards for earthen construction, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:37">0:52:37-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  have been really important in informing our proposed, CRI's proposed COB code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:54</a>:</strong>  But there's another answer that I want to elaborate just a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:52:54">0:52:54-0:53:01</a>:</strong>  It was really important when we did the testing, the structural testing at Santa Clara University<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:01">0:53:01-0:53:09</a>:</strong>  to include what we came to call the common practice wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:09">0:53:09-0:53:14</a>:</strong>  Essentially the wall that's most, the COB wall that's most commonly built or has been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:14">0:53:14-0:53:21</a>:</strong>  built over the last couple of decades, especially in the Western United States and in other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:21">0:53:21-0:53:25</a>:</strong>  parts of the country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:25">0:53:25-0:53:28</a>:</strong>  So the reinforcing was straw only.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:28">0:53:28-0:53:39</a>:</strong>  Well, the foundation was, we simulated a stone, a stone, or a mortared stone foundation with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:39">0:53:39-0:53:44</a>:</strong>  an irregular top to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:44">0:53:44-0:53:48</a>:</strong>  And then a straw only reinforcement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:48">0:53:48-0:53:54</a>:</strong>  So a friction connection at the bottom where the COB wall meets the foundation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:53:54">0:53:54-0:54:01</a>:</strong>  And then at the top of the wall, there were anchors into the bond beam that we felt that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:01">0:54:01-0:54:05</a>:</strong>  that was necessary to get a fair result.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:05">0:54:05-0:54:09</a>:</strong>  So that wall was tested and it does have some capacity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:09">0:54:09-0:54:17</a>:</strong>  It actually exceeded our expectations, but the capacity is still limited and would have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:17">0:54:17-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  very, would be very challenging to use that type of a wall in a high seismic zone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:30</a>:</strong>  Or if it were used in a high seismic zone, you would need a long length of wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:30">0:54:30-0:54:36</a>:</strong>  So there's the capacity of the wall, its strength per foot, you can think of it that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:36">0:54:36-0:54:41</a>:</strong>  And then depending on the situation, you may need more or less length of that wall and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:41">0:54:41-0:54:48</a>:</strong>  then distribute it in a balanced manner in the building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:48">0:54:48-0:54:55</a>:</strong>  But also, well, so that what we're calling this common practice wall would have fairly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:54:55">0:54:55-0:55:02</a>:</strong>  high applicability in almost all of the United States, because most of the United States<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:02">0:55:02-0:55:09</a>:</strong>  is a lower seismic, lower seismic risks, lower seismic risk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:09">0:55:09-0:55:16</a>:</strong>  So we, what's called their categories A through E essentially, with A and B being the lowest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:16">0:55:16-0:55:17</a>:</strong>  seismic design category.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:17">0:55:17-0:55:24</a>:</strong>  And most of the US is in those two categories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:24">0:55:24-0:55:33</a>:</strong>  So that's important to understand, but also that it's not only the Western states that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:33">0:55:33-0:55:36</a>:</strong>  are subject to earthquakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:36">0:55:36-0:55:43</a>:</strong>  Of course, there's Hawaii, it's not part of the contiguous 48 in Alaska.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:43">0:55:43-0:55:49</a>:</strong>  But there are other areas such as the St. Louis area, St. Louis, Memphis, it's known<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:49">0:55:49-0:55:52</a>:</strong>  to be vulnerable to earthquakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:52">0:55:52-0:55:59</a>:</strong>  There are coastal parts of the Southeast have some seismic vulnerability.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:55:59">0:55:59-0:56:07</a>:</strong>  And over recent years, earthquakes have been known to occur in places that just haven't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:07">0:56:07-0:56:10</a>:</strong>  experienced them in recorded history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:10">0:56:10-0:56:12</a>:</strong>  So things are changing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:12">0:56:12-0:56:19</a>:</strong>  Although it's still California, Oregon, Washington, especially that are, and Idaho is another<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:19">0:56:19-0:56:24</a>:</strong>  state that's subjected to, that is subject to high seismic risks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:24">0:56:24-0:56:32</a>:</strong>  So I just wanted to lay that out geographically for the listener about expectations about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:32">0:56:32-0:56:38</a>:</strong>  the different wall systems and then relative to seismic risk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:38">0:56:38-0:56:45</a>:</strong>  But also, and I think you mentioned it earlier, Oliver, there's high wind regions of the country<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:45">0:56:45-0:56:54</a>:</strong>  in the Rockies, Rocky Mountains, of course, any area of the United States that's vulnerable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:54">0:56:54-0:56:59</a>:</strong>  to tornadoes or certainly hurricanes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:56:59">0:56:59-0:57:09</a>:</strong>  So the high wind loads impose lateral loads, not in the same way exactly as earthquakes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:09">0:57:09-0:57:15</a>:</strong>  do, but the effect on the building can be much the same where it needs to resist these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:15">0:57:15-0:57:21</a>:</strong>  lateral loads that 99% of the time, 99.9% of the time, the building does not experience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:21">0:57:21-0:57:22</a>:</strong>  them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:22">0:57:22-0:57:28</a>:</strong>  But when the building does experience those loads, they need to be able to resist them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:28">0:57:28-0:57:29</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:29">0:57:29-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  So with all of these changes to the proposed code based on the information that you've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:39</a>:</strong>  been gathering and the collaboration with other organizations around the world, this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:39">0:57:39-0:57:45</a>:</strong>  is a lot of information for people to navigate, especially because COD has up until now mostly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:45">0:57:45-0:57:51</a>:</strong>  been worked with by owner builders and designers and people without perhaps the professional<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:51">0:57:51-0:57:54</a>:</strong>  certifications to navigate these types of codes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:57:54">0:57:54-0:58:00</a>:</strong>  Anthony, could you give us a bit of a summary of what is recommended in these documents<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:00">0:58:00-0:58:07</a>:</strong>  for people looking to build and still be compliant to the proposed codes that are ahead?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:07">0:58:07-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I'm happy to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:20</a>:</strong>  In a simple statement, it's best when buildings have good boots and a good hat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:20">0:58:20-0:58:27</a>:</strong>  Brief foundation and appropriate connection and quality roofing system and diaphragm and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:27">0:58:27-0:58:29</a>:</strong>  appropriate connection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:29">0:58:29-0:58:40</a>:</strong>  That likely means anchorage of some sort and aspect ratios of wall thicknesses to heights<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:40">0:58:40-0:58:42</a>:</strong>  and wall lengths to heights are important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:42">0:58:42-0:58:51</a>:</strong>  And we've worked hard at laying out guidelines on recommended wall system makeups.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:51">0:58:51-0:58:58</a>:</strong>  And that is in the proposed code appendix, which is a public document and it's on cobcode.org,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:58:58">0:58:58-0:59:00</a>:</strong>  which is CRI's website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:00">0:59:00-0:59:07</a>:</strong>  And I highly recommend, you know, it's a code document, not all of it's an easy read, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:07">0:59:07-0:59:14</a>:</strong>  there are the charts that contain at least the wall makeups that are very accessible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:14">0:59:14-0:59:21</a>:</strong>  to understand the general options that seem to be the main prevailing tested wall systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:21">0:59:21-0:59:23</a>:</strong>  that we have confidence in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:23">0:59:23-0:59:24</a>:</strong>  Nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:24">0:59:24-0:59:29</a>:</strong>  And I know that you talked about anchorage to the foundations and then anchorage up to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:29">0:59:29-0:59:35</a>:</strong>  the roof as well, kind of being the two most key aspects for structural stability with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:35">0:59:35-0:59:36</a>:</strong>  this material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:36">0:59:36-0:59:42</a>:</strong>  I know that getting it to anchor to the foundation is probably the less difficult of those two<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:42">0:59:42-0:59:43</a>:</strong>  things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:43">0:59:43-0:59:48</a>:</strong>  What kind of anchored system would you recommend to hold strongly to the roof in general?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:48">0:59:48-0:59:52</a>:</strong>  I realize that there are going to be variables with what people have access to as far as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:52">0:59:52-0:59:54</a>:</strong>  materials and techniques.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:54">0:59:54-0:59:56</a>:</strong>  That's a good question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=0:59:56">0:59:56-1:00:02</a>:</strong>  I actually wouldn't agree that it's more difficult to anchor to your roof system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:02">1:00:02-1:00:09</a>:</strong>  Most cob wall systems that we've been designing with commonly have wood as their top plates,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:09">1:00:09-1:00:17</a>:</strong>  which offers a flat wood system for a wood roof framing system to connect to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:17">1:00:17-1:00:22</a>:</strong>  And then your roof framing is a standard wood construction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:22">1:00:22-1:00:27</a>:</strong>  There are many other material options, but just they all can go off this analog where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:27">1:00:27-1:00:32</a>:</strong>  if you have a wood top plate, which is the term for the wood beam that would rest on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:32">1:00:32-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  top of a wall, you would have anchors sticking down from that top plate, anchor bolts, just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:46</a>:</strong>  standard bolts that folks would recognize, a half inch, 5-8 inch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:46">1:00:46-1:00:48</a>:</strong>  And these would be hanging down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:48">1:00:48-1:00:50</a>:</strong>  You would likely build a shoring system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:50">1:00:50-1:00:51</a>:</strong>  You don't need to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:51">1:00:51-1:00:56</a>:</strong>  You could put it up in various ways, but ideally you would build your cob wall up around these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:00:56">1:00:56-1:01:03</a>:</strong>  bolts and then your top plate would be placed on top and cinched down then with a nut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:03">1:01:03-1:01:09</a>:</strong>  And that's the most ideal way to connect a top plate or roofing system to the top of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:09">1:01:09-1:01:10</a>:</strong>  your wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:10">1:01:10-1:01:20</a>:</strong>  In terms of compliance with the proposed cob code, if it, well, I'm not going to say if,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:20">1:01:20-1:01:29</a>:</strong>  but when, when it's approved and ultimately adopted, the structural compliance with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:29">1:01:29-1:01:36</a>:</strong>  structural aspects that Anthony talked a bit about is very important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:36">1:01:36-1:01:43</a>:</strong>  It's central to a safe cob building is that it be safe structurally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:43">1:01:43-1:01:50</a>:</strong>  And so there are these requirements when cob is used as a structural material that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:50">1:01:50-1:01:56</a>:</strong>  contained in the proposed cob code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:01:56">1:01:56-1:02:05</a>:</strong>  But to expand from that, this proposed cob appendix, it's a proposed appendix in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:05">1:02:05-1:02:10</a>:</strong>  international residential code, which is the national model code for the United States<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:10">1:02:10-1:02:13</a>:</strong>  and can be used anywhere really in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:13">1:02:13-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  Thus its name is with the word international as part of the name.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:28</a>:</strong>  But so this proposed appendix requires that cob buildings comply with everything else<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:28">1:02:28-1:02:37</a>:</strong>  that's in the international residential code unless it's stated otherwise in this appendix.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:37">1:02:37-1:02:47</a>:</strong>  So this, the appendix, it is prime, well, it is about the use of cob as a wall system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:47">1:02:47-1:02:54</a>:</strong>  All other parts of the building, so the roof system, the foundation, windows and doors,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:02:54">1:02:54-1:03:01</a>:</strong>  electrical, plumbing, all those things would need to comply with the what's elsewhere in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:01">1:03:01-1:03:05</a>:</strong>  the residential code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:05">1:03:05-1:03:12</a>:</strong>  And so I just to frame it that way is important to understand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:12">1:03:12-1:03:14</a>:</strong>  Yeah, certainly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:14">1:03:14-1:03:18</a>:</strong>  It's one of the things that I've tried to impress upon the people that I've taught in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:18">1:03:18-1:03:19</a>:</strong>  cob building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:19">1:03:19-1:03:25</a>:</strong>  And since I come as well from a conventional building background and got into natural building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:25">1:03:25-1:03:30</a>:</strong>  later, I think it's very important to know that the same standards of building for safety<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:30">1:03:30-1:03:37</a>:</strong>  and general, yeah, just general standards for how things are installed and the way that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:37">1:03:37-1:03:39</a>:</strong>  they function is not that different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:39">1:03:39-1:03:43</a>:</strong>  Really the only thing that changes a bit is the primary material that you're using to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:43">1:03:43-1:03:44</a>:</strong>  build.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:44">1:03:44-1:03:49</a>:</strong>  But the rest of those safety guidelines are there for very good reason and applied just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:49">1:03:49-1:03:54</a>:</strong>  as much to natural buildings as they do to conventional or industrial ones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:03:54">1:03:54-1:04:00</a>:</strong>  Now, so with all of these things outlined and a good sort of summary of what people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:00">1:04:00-1:04:06</a>:</strong>  can expect to look at when building with this material once it gets approved, can you talk<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:06">1:04:06-1:04:08</a>:</strong>  to our listeners about how they can get involved?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:08">1:04:08-1:04:13</a>:</strong>  Because it is not yet legal or on the books to build with cob, but we're at a crucial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:13">1:04:13-1:04:16</a>:</strong>  moment here where it very soon could be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:16">1:04:16-1:04:22</a>:</strong>  John or Martin, would you like to tell us about what the upcoming steps are?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:22">1:04:22-1:04:30</a>:</strong>  So this proposed appendix that our CRI team has put together for the international residential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:30">1:04:30-1:04:31</a>:</strong>  code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:31">1:04:31-1:04:40</a>:</strong>  And in saying that, I want to mention that this proposal has had input from over 30 people,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:40">1:04:40-1:04:43</a>:</strong>  design and building professionals who have experience with cob.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:43">1:04:43-1:04:52</a>:</strong>  So it's not only the CRI team, there are people that are directly members of CRI, but many<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:52">1:04:52-1:04:58</a>:</strong>  other design and building professionals have had input.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:04:58">1:04:58-1:05:06</a>:</strong>  And we welcome input in the future because regardless of what happens right now with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:06">1:05:06-1:05:12</a>:</strong>  this code proposal, building codes are living documents and they change over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:12">1:05:12-1:05:19</a>:</strong>  So we're really interested to hear input from all sources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:19">1:05:19-1:05:26</a>:</strong>  But this current proposal, as I mentioned earlier, was unfortunately disapproved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:26">1:05:26-1:05:34</a>:</strong>  That's the, was disapproved in May at the first code hearings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:34">1:05:34-1:05:41</a>:</strong>  And we think it was, well, we know it was primarily, if not entirely because of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:41">1:05:41-1:05:44</a>:</strong>  fire resistance rating that I mentioned earlier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:44">1:05:44-1:05:51</a>:</strong>  But we've made adjustments in this next step of the process, which is the second and final<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:51">1:05:51-1:05:54</a>:</strong>  code hearings at the end of this month.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:05:54">1:05:54-1:06:01</a>:</strong>  We expect those hearings to occur on October 26th.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:01">1:06:01-1:06:06</a>:</strong>  And the location is in Las Vegas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:06">1:06:06-1:06:12</a>:</strong>  I will be there, Anthony Dente will be there, and a few others to testify in support of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:12">1:06:12-1:06:14</a>:</strong>  the proposal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:14">1:06:14-1:06:22</a>:</strong>  And in this second step, the decision about approval or disapproval is made by building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:22">1:06:22-1:06:24</a>:</strong>  and fire officials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:24">1:06:24-1:06:31</a>:</strong>  And that, this is where listeners can help.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:31">1:06:31-1:06:41</a>:</strong>  There will be a vote in the room at the hearings itself, a preliminary vote, I'll call it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:41">1:06:41-1:06:52</a>:</strong>  There might be somewhere between two and 500 people in the room there voting on the proposal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:06:52">1:06:52-1:07:01</a>:</strong>  But more importantly for listeners is there is, will be a subsequent online vote approximately<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:01">1:07:01-1:07:04</a>:</strong>  the second two weeks of November.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:04">1:07:04-1:07:10</a>:</strong>  And building officials, building fire officials from all over the country will vote on these,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:10">1:07:10-1:07:16</a>:</strong>  not only this code proposal, but all of the code proposals that are on the table.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:16">1:07:16-1:07:24</a>:</strong>  So our CRI team has reached out to building officials that we know, and there's a campaign<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:24">1:07:24-1:07:31</a>:</strong>  to get out the vote, get out the building official vote for the COB code proposal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:31">1:07:31-1:07:39</a>:</strong>  The best way for listener to do that is to go to the CRI's website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:39">1:07:39-1:07:50</a>:</strong>  So cobcode.org and front and center on the homepage, you'll see a campaign, a link regarding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:50">1:07:50-1:07:53</a>:</strong>  this campaign to get out the vote.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:53">1:07:53-1:07:58</a>:</strong>  And there's lots of information there on how to do that, how to help.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:07:58">1:07:58-1:08:07</a>:</strong>  And it boils down to mostly people who feel this is an important proposal to them or others<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:07">1:08:07-1:08:16</a>:</strong>  that they know to contact their local building official and encourage them to vote for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:16">1:08:16-1:08:19</a>:</strong>  COB code proposal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:19">1:08:19-1:08:31</a>:</strong>  They can, or the listener can contact CRI through the website and give us the name and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:31">1:08:31-1:08:34</a>:</strong>  contact information of their building official.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:34">1:08:34-1:08:41</a>:</strong>  They can basically hand it over to CRI and we can take it from there, or they can encourage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:41">1:08:41-1:08:44</a>:</strong>  the building official directly on their own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:44">1:08:44-1:08:49</a>:</strong>  And how many votes are needed for this to get passed or to be heard?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:49">1:08:49-1:08:54</a>:</strong>  At this stage in the process, a two thirds majority is required.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:54">1:08:54-1:08:59</a>:</strong>  So that can be challenging, but it is achievable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:08:59">1:08:59-1:09:05</a>:</strong>  There are about 30,000 building officials across the United States, building of fire<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:05">1:09:05-1:09:07</a>:</strong>  officials, very large number.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:07">1:09:07-1:09:15</a>:</strong>  In practice, not a small percentage of them actually vote on these COB proposals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:15">1:09:15-1:09:19</a>:</strong>  They're very busy people and they have a lot on their minds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:19">1:09:19-1:09:26</a>:</strong>  So there are certain ones who are particularly focused on building code development and those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:26">1:09:26-1:09:28</a>:</strong>  are the ones who tend to vote.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:28">1:09:28-1:09:40</a>:</strong>  But any virtually any building or fire official can vote, has the authority to vote.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:40">1:09:40-1:09:48</a>:</strong>  So that's where reaching out to your local building official could cause a building official<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:48">1:09:48-1:09:52</a>:</strong>  who, or fire official who may not otherwise vote to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:52">1:09:52-1:09:58</a>:</strong>  If they hear that someone in their community is really interested in this, they're likely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:09:58">1:09:58-1:10:05</a>:</strong>  to follow through and maybe cast a vote that they wouldn't have otherwise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:05">1:10:05-1:10:16</a>:</strong>  And in terms of the number of votes, even historically as few as 150 votes can cause<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:16">1:10:16-1:10:20</a>:</strong>  a proposal to pass, to be approved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:20">1:10:20-1:10:31</a>:</strong>  So you compare that to 30,000, which is a very formidable number, but in practice as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:31">1:10:31-1:10:34</a>:</strong>  few as 100, 150 can make the difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:34">1:10:34-1:10:35</a>:</strong>  Wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:35">1:10:35-1:10:40</a>:</strong>  Well, that's a definitely positive message and likelihood for this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:40">1:10:40-1:10:45</a>:</strong>  Tell me about why someone who perhaps either hasn't built with COB or hasn't even thought<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:45">1:10:45-1:10:51</a>:</strong>  about it up until now might be interested in making sure that this kind of advancement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:51">1:10:51-1:10:52</a>:</strong>  to the code happens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:52">1:10:52-1:10:58</a>:</strong>  Well, why would anybody want to have this become a reality?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:10:58">1:10:58-1:11:06</a>:</strong>  And it's basically because my experience with the CRI has since I got involved has been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:06">1:11:06-1:11:15</a>:</strong>  that because it's become known that I'm involved, people would contact me and say, I want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:15">1:11:15-1:11:20</a>:</strong>  build a COB house and I live here and what am I going to do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:20">1:11:20-1:11:27</a>:</strong>  And so my response would be basically until there is a COB code, if you're in any place<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:27">1:11:27-1:11:35</a>:</strong>  where there's permits required, your options are very limited and you can either build<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:35">1:11:35-1:11:41</a>:</strong>  through the alternate materials and methods procedure, which requires engineering and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:41">1:11:41-1:11:49</a>:</strong>  architectural drawings and the attendant expenses and a period of needing to educate your building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:49">1:11:49-1:11:54</a>:</strong>  department as to what you want to do is actually meets the intent of the code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:11:54">1:11:54-1:12:00</a>:</strong>  It's a big, long drawn out process and requires resources and patience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:00">1:12:00-1:12:10</a>:</strong>  And this would basically pretty much go away once the IRC COB construction appendix is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:10">1:12:10-1:12:18</a>:</strong>  approved and adopted because at that point, anybody that's in a jurisdiction, a location<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:18">1:12:18-1:12:23</a>:</strong>  that requires building permits would be able to go in and say that I want to build a COB<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:23">1:12:23-1:12:27</a>:</strong>  building and here's the code I'm going to use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:27">1:12:27-1:12:34</a>:</strong>  And that would actually make it quite possible for them to then build in their location,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:34">1:12:34-1:12:36</a>:</strong>  which now does not happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:36">1:12:36-1:12:44</a>:</strong>  And why is this important is because it means that COB buildings will get built, whereas<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:44">1:12:44-1:12:51</a>:</strong>  now they get stopped except for people who are willing to build outside the code realm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:51">1:12:51-1:12:56</a>:</strong>  And basically we call that outlaw building and all the attendant problems that we've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:12:56">1:12:56-1:13:06</a>:</strong>  just discussed earlier as far as lack of standards, improper building, poor building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:06">1:13:06-1:13:13</a>:</strong>  So these are all things that the code is aimed at solving.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:13">1:13:13-1:13:16</a>:</strong>  That's why it's really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:16">1:13:16-1:13:19</a>:</strong>  And Oliver, this is Martin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:19">1:13:19-1:13:27</a>:</strong>  Martin outlined the many good reasons for specific to COB, why it's important that this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:27">1:13:27-1:13:29</a>:</strong>  proposed appendix be approved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:29">1:13:29-1:13:41</a>:</strong>  And I want to also add some broader reasons for anyone who is interested in what are sometimes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:41">1:13:41-1:13:48</a>:</strong>  called natural building methods and environmentally responsible ways of building that are more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:48">1:13:48-1:13:51</a>:</strong>  responsible than conventional ways of building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:51">1:13:51-1:13:59</a>:</strong>  The COB code proposal is important because this, by getting COB into the building code,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:13:59">1:13:59-1:14:05</a>:</strong>  it will pave the way for other natural building systems to follow, including especially other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:05">1:14:05-1:14:07</a>:</strong>  earthen building systems, such as Adobe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:07">1:14:07-1:14:11</a>:</strong>  Well, Adobe is already in the international building code, but there's even there, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:11">1:14:11-1:14:16</a>:</strong>  struggles to correct a lot of deficiencies in that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:16">1:14:16-1:14:21</a>:</strong>  But Adobe more broadly, rammed earth, earth bag, compressed earth blocks, all those earthen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:21">1:14:21-1:14:30</a>:</strong>  building systems and other natural building systems, along with others, managed to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:30">1:14:30-1:14:34</a>:</strong>  straw bale construction as an appendix to the international residential code about six<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:34">1:14:34-1:14:36</a>:</strong>  years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:36">1:14:36-1:14:42</a>:</strong>  And that helped pave the way for straw clay to enter the building code.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:42">1:14:42-1:14:45</a>:</strong>  So they all help each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:45">1:14:45-1:14:52</a>:</strong>  And it's important for that reason, for that reason alone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:52">1:14:52-1:14:57</a>:</strong>  Also just so people understand, the international residential code, which applies to one and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:14:57">1:14:57-1:15:04</a>:</strong>  two family dwellings and townhouses, it is the national model code for the United States.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:04">1:15:04-1:15:15</a>:</strong>  So getting anything into that code has broad effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:15">1:15:15-1:15:20</a>:</strong>  It's used as the basis for the residential code in virtually every jurisdiction in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:20">1:15:20-1:15:21</a>:</strong>  United States.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:21">1:15:21-1:15:25</a>:</strong>  And it can be used internationally as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:25">1:15:25-1:15:26</a>:</strong>  Marvelous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:26">1:15:26-1:15:32</a>:</strong>  Now, I mean, this is something that I personally feel very passionate about as a natural builder<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:32">1:15:32-1:15:36</a>:</strong>  who's worked around different places in the United States and around the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:36">1:15:36-1:15:43</a>:</strong>  Like you said, this has the potential to have ripple effects across the ability to work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:43">1:15:43-1:15:48</a>:</strong>  with any kind of material, not just cob moving out towards in the future, but especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:48">1:15:48-1:15:54</a>:</strong>  for those earthen materials that have so much potential for the future of building in our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:54">1:15:54-1:15:58</a>:</strong>  country and all of the advantages that they bring with them, especially because they've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:15:58">1:15:58-1:16:03</a>:</strong>  been proven for much longer periods of time than most of the industrial materials that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:03">1:16:03-1:16:04</a>:</strong>  have come up since then.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:04">1:16:04-1:16:09</a>:</strong>  Now, I don't live in the United States anymore, but I definitely am going to be reaching out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:09">1:16:09-1:16:12</a>:</strong>  to a lot of natural building friends that I have in my network.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:12">1:16:12-1:16:18</a>:</strong>  Could you just remind our audience one more time what they can do to actively help this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:18">1:16:18-1:16:22</a>:</strong>  along and which dates are important to remember?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:22">1:16:22-1:16:29</a>:</strong>  Well, to contact their local building official or fire official and make them aware of this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:29">1:16:29-1:16:37</a>:</strong>  proposal and the importance that cob building has to them, that they want it as a choice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:37">1:16:37-1:16:41</a>:</strong>  in their community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:41">1:16:41-1:16:52</a>:</strong>  And they can go to CRI's website, cobcode.org, and there's information there about how to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:52">1:16:52-1:16:55</a>:</strong>  proceed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:16:55">1:16:55-1:17:04</a>:</strong>  And if you want, you can hand this off to CRI and we can take it from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:04">1:17:04-1:17:10</a>:</strong>  One more thing I need to add is that, yeah, one big, really important thing that the listeners<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:10">1:17:10-1:17:14</a>:</strong>  can do is to support CRI.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:14">1:17:14-1:17:21</a>:</strong>  We're hampered by funding and we have a crowdfunding campaign, which has been in effect for a while<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:21">1:17:21-1:17:29</a>:</strong>  and has brought us in some of the money that we need to pay for all of the work that we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:29">1:17:29-1:17:32</a>:</strong>  doing, but we definitely need more support.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:32">1:17:32-1:17:42</a>:</strong>  And so I encourage all the listeners who care about seeing this become a reality to log<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:42">1:17:42-1:17:53</a>:</strong>  onto our website and go to the crowdfunding campaign and donate to CRI.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:17:53">1:17:53-1:18:01</a>:</strong>  That would be incredibly appreciated and will go a long ways towards helping us cover costs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:01">1:18:01-1:18:14</a>:</strong>  we've already incurred for this work and to help us pay for all of our needed future testing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:14">1:18:14-1:18:15</a>:</strong>  Very important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:15">1:18:15-1:18:17</a>:</strong>  So please support CRI.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:17">1:18:17-1:18:18</a>:</strong>  Donate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:18">1:18:18-1:18:19</a>:</strong>  Certainly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:19">1:18:19-1:18:20</a>:</strong>  Well, thank you so much, John.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:20">1:18:20-1:18:23</a>:</strong>  Martin, I really appreciate the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:23">1:18:23-1:18:27</a>:</strong>  Anthony had to run off to another meeting and I know that there are others helping in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:27">1:18:27-1:18:33</a>:</strong>  this effort and members of the CRI that have helped to bring about this potential change<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:33">1:18:33-1:18:38</a>:</strong>  that could improve the possibilities for so many people, especially owner builders like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-cob-research-institute/#t=1:18:38">1:18:38-1:18:40</a>:</strong>  myself and others who are listening.<br />
