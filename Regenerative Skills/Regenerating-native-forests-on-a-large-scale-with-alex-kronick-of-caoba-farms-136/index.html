<p><strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:13</a>:</strong>  Welcome to the Abundant Edge Podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:13">0:00:13-0:00:17</a>:</strong>  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:17">0:00:17-0:00:22</a>:</strong>  natural building as we aspire to help you reach your highest potential for yourself,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:22">0:00:22-0:00:25</a>:</strong>  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:25">0:00:25-0:00:29</a>:</strong>  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:00:29">0:00:29-0:00:33</a>:</strong>  week's episode, so let's jump right in!<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:00">0:01:00-0:01:04</a>:</strong>  I've been so fortunate to get to speak directly with so many people who have created incredible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:04">0:01:04-0:01:10</a>:</strong>  examples of permaculture abundance and ecological health and resilience through this podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:10">0:01:10-0:01:14</a>:</strong>  And though I've gotten to visit many permaculture projects and practitioners, many of the ones<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:14">0:01:14-0:01:19</a>:</strong>  that I've seen in person are either just in the early stages of getting off the ground,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:19">0:01:19-0:01:24</a>:</strong>  or haven't quite found their balance between financial and ecological prosperity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:24">0:01:24-0:01:27</a>:</strong>  The best examples that I've seen in person are the projects that Alex Kronick and his<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:27">0:01:27-0:01:32</a>:</strong>  team have managed in the area around Antigua Guatemala, namely, Coaba Farms and his new<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:32">0:01:32-0:01:34</a>:</strong>  project in Paramos.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:34">0:01:34-0:01:40</a>:</strong>  Now back in Season 2, Neil Hegarty, who I used to work with on the Gran Haciqin project,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:40">0:01:40-0:01:43</a>:</strong>  interviewed Alex in an interview called, The Most Impressive Permaculturalist That You've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:43">0:01:43-0:01:45</a>:</strong>  Never Heard Of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:45">0:01:45-0:01:50</a>:</strong>  And since then, I've been back many times to visit Alex both at his farm slash event<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:50">0:01:50-0:01:55</a>:</strong>  space slash restaurant at Coaba Farms, and even more notably, the larger project that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:01:55">0:01:55-0:02:01</a>:</strong>  has been underway for just a couple years in the town of Paramos, northwest of Antigua.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:01">0:02:01-0:02:05</a>:</strong>  There Alex has been combining pieces of land that he's been able to acquire as he builds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:05">0:02:05-0:02:09</a>:</strong>  towards his dream of restoring the native forests of that region and strategically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:09">0:02:09-0:02:15</a>:</strong>  incorporate agroforestry, market gardening, ecotourism, and event space to ensure the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:15">0:02:15-0:02:19</a>:</strong>  value and protection of the native ecosystem is preserved indefinitely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:19">0:02:19-0:02:23</a>:</strong>  Now though I didn't have the time to bring recording equipment along on the few trips<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:23">0:02:23-0:02:29</a>:</strong>  that I made up there in person, I got to catch Alex on a call later to ask him to go over<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:29">0:02:29-0:02:33</a>:</strong>  a few of the many intricacies of his plan and steps for development that are still in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:33">0:02:33-0:02:38</a>:</strong>  the early stages but gaining incredible traction on his site.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:38">0:02:38-0:02:42</a>:</strong>  In this interview we cover many of the details of the unique climate and context where the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:42">0:02:42-0:02:48</a>:</strong>  land is located and how it informs goals and designs that Alex is developing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:48">0:02:48-0:02:52</a>:</strong>  He talks at length about how he and his team are choosing which of the native species to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:52">0:02:52-0:02:56</a>:</strong>  propagate and use for reforestation and how they are creating nurseries to grow thousands<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:56">0:02:56-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  of trees at a time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:04</a>:</strong>  We also talk about how the government incentives for reforestation in Guatemala are not as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:04">0:03:04-0:03:09</a>:</strong>  beneficial as they might appear and how navigating the regulations can both help and hinder ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:09">0:03:09-0:03:11</a>:</strong>  goals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:11">0:03:11-0:03:15</a>:</strong>  We even cover how different trees can affect the water table on your land, passive irrigation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:15">0:03:15-0:03:20</a>:</strong>  methods, even education programs for school-aged kids, and much more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:20">0:03:20-0:03:24</a>:</strong>  I've learned so much from Alex and his methodical approach to land-based projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:24">0:03:24-0:03:28</a>:</strong>  He's definitely one of the voices in permaculture and ecological business that I hope more people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:28">0:03:28-0:03:34</a>:</strong>  look to and reference as examples of no-nonsense, results-based progress.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:34">0:03:34-0:03:38</a>:</strong>  I've also included a bunch of pictures from his farm and nursery that Alex sent to me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:38">0:03:38-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  and you can check them all out at the website at AbundantEdge.com.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:46</a>:</strong>  There are a few moments of bad reception from the internet call, but they only last a few<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:46">0:03:46-0:03:48</a>:</strong>  seconds and it's not hard to follow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:48">0:03:48-0:03:51</a>:</strong>  So with that said, I'll hand things over now to Alex.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:51">0:03:51-0:03:54</a>:</strong>  Hey, Alex, thanks so much for making the time today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:54">0:03:54-0:03:55</a>:</strong>  How are you doing, man?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:55">0:03:55-0:03:56</a>:</strong>  I'm doing good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:04:00</a>:</strong>  It's a great day here in Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:00">0:04:00-0:04:05</a>:</strong>  No rain, which we need, but other than that, it's a nice day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:05">0:04:05-0:04:06</a>:</strong>  Nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:06">0:04:06-0:04:08</a>:</strong>  Now, so you guys are in the rainy season right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:08">0:04:08-0:04:11</a>:</strong>  You said you've got a dry day today, but you've got so many other things going on with your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:11">0:04:11-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:12">0:04:12-0:04:16</a>:</strong>  You're splitting your time between multiple businesses, multiple land projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:16">0:04:16-0:04:17</a>:</strong>  You just recently had a child.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:17">0:04:17-0:04:19</a>:</strong>  Congratulations on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:19">0:04:19-0:04:20</a>:</strong>  Thanks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:20">0:04:20-0:04:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:21">0:04:21-0:04:22</a>:</strong>  Lots of big changes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:22">0:04:22-0:04:26</a>:</strong>  I actually quit my other job last week, so I'm full time now at the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:26">0:04:26-0:04:27</a>:</strong>  Whoa, that's a big step.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:27">0:04:27-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  Congratulations on that as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:30">0:04:30-0:04:33</a>:</strong>  We'll spend more time with my daughter and wife.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:33">0:04:33-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  Figured they're worth it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:37</a>:</strong>  You never get that time back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:37">0:04:37-0:04:39</a>:</strong>  Now look, so we did a previous interview with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:39">0:04:39-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  It was Neil who did the interview with you last time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:47</a>:</strong>  And so we'll breeze past your background because if anybody is interested, they can check out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:04:52</a>:</strong>  the previous episode that we did called the best permaculture list that you've never heard<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:52">0:04:52-0:04:53</a>:</strong>  of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:53">0:04:53-0:04:58</a>:</strong>  So you grew up mostly in Guatemala, but you split your time between the US and Guatemala<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:58">0:04:58-0:04:59</a>:</strong>  for a while.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:04:59">0:04:59-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  We talked in the last episode about your project in Antigua, Koaba Farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:09</a>:</strong>  And until now, you've been known mostly in your community and around the world as the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:09">0:05:09-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  founder of Koaba Farms in Antigua, Guatemala, which has been featured in the New York Times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:18</a>:</strong>  You had a lot of success with that project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:18">0:05:18-0:05:22</a>:</strong>  Like I said, any listeners who are interested in that can go and see the previous episode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:22">0:05:22-0:05:28</a>:</strong>  But let's talk about now your project in Paramos, which is a town about 40, 45 minutes drive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:28">0:05:28-0:05:29</a>:</strong>  away from Antigua.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:29">0:05:29-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  Half an hour.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:31">0:05:31-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  About half an hour.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:33</a>:</strong>  Oh, about half an hour.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:33">0:05:33-0:05:34</a>:</strong>  Good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:34">0:05:34-0:05:35</a>:</strong>  Not too far to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:35">0:05:35-0:05:38</a>:</strong>  And I've been out there to visit a couple of times, but it's been a few months since<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:38">0:05:38-0:05:40</a>:</strong>  I've seen you now that I've moved out to Spain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:45</a>:</strong>  So tell me a little bit about the vision for this project and kind of set the scene for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:45">0:05:45-0:05:46</a>:</strong>  me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:46">0:05:46-0:05:49</a>:</strong>  What kind of terrain are you working with and what's the overall vision?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:49">0:05:49-0:05:55</a>:</strong>  Okay, so Paramos is a much different project than Koaba Farms here in town.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:05:55">0:05:55-0:06:02</a>:</strong>  It's three acres in town, but Paramos is 200 acres and expanding as we're looking to buy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:02">0:06:02-0:06:05</a>:</strong>  more land as it comes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:05">0:06:05-0:06:12</a>:</strong>  I have businesses interested in investing for growth in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:12">0:06:12-0:06:23</a>:</strong>  And the idea behind it is more reforestation, greening the mountains, getting more water,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:23">0:06:23-0:06:26</a>:</strong>  and biodiversity in the species that are around.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:26">0:06:26-0:06:32</a>:</strong>  So that's the overall project with the idea of bringing in tourists, which we already<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:32">0:06:32-0:06:42</a>:</strong>  get a lot to the farm in town, taking one out there to do a little bit more of an extensive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:42">0:06:42-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  visit in terms of housing and staying the night or two, and eating, but also walking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:57</a>:</strong>  through the forest, seeing wildlife, and understanding what the concept is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:06:57">0:06:57-0:07:04</a>:</strong>  Now, you are also still kind of producing food crops there as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:04">0:07:04-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  You've got something about, if I remember correctly from the last time I was out there,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:14</a>:</strong>  it's about a 60-40 split, 60% of the vegetables and the food that you produce for market being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:14">0:07:14-0:07:19</a>:</strong>  set out in that land in Paramos and about 40 at Koaba Farms, mostly just because it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:19">0:07:19-0:07:21</a>:</strong>  a much smaller operation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:21">0:07:21-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  Is that right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:24</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's correct.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:24">0:07:24-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  And so you're kind of in this very hilly, mountain-y terrain, actually in both sites,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:37</a>:</strong>  but because the site in Antigua is smaller, it's not on such a pendiente, a disleveled<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:37">0:07:37-0:07:38</a>:</strong>  surface.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:38">0:07:38-0:07:45</a>:</strong>  But out in Paramos, you've got serious declines going into this valley, and there's probably<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:45">0:07:45-0:07:47</a>:</strong>  a ton of microclimates in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:47">0:07:47-0:07:51</a>:</strong>  How did you kind of decide on where to focus on producing your crops and where to focus<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:51">0:07:51-0:07:53</a>:</strong>  on reforestation?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:53">0:07:53-0:07:57</a>:</strong>  So I focused on where to plant crops based on where there wasn't forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:07:57">0:07:57-0:08:02</a>:</strong>  I'm not going to cut down forest to plant trees, to plant veggies or other items.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:02">0:08:02-0:08:04</a>:</strong>  So I'm protecting the forest that's already there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:10</a>:</strong>  So I chose areas that were already deforested since the land that we've got there has been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:10">0:08:10-0:08:12</a>:</strong>  purchased through multiple neighbors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:12">0:08:12-0:08:16</a>:</strong>  So we started with one decent-sized property, and we've been buying out the neighbors little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:16">0:08:16-0:08:17</a>:</strong>  by little.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:17">0:08:17-0:08:25</a>:</strong>  And so choosing areas that are not forested, have a good sun exposure, and very important,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:25">0:08:25-0:08:27</a>:</strong>  there's springs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:27">0:08:27-0:08:31</a>:</strong>  And so choosing areas where we can gravity feed from the springs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:31">0:08:31-0:08:36</a>:</strong>  Those were the most optimal areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:36">0:08:36-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  That doesn't mean we can't farm elsewhere, but in order to get the most out of the resources<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:45</a>:</strong>  there, those were the areas that were chosen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:45">0:08:45-0:08:47</a>:</strong>  And there was plenty of them, so that's where we're at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:47">0:08:47-0:08:48</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:48">0:08:48-0:08:51</a>:</strong>  Now give me an idea of how degraded the land was when you purchased it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:51">0:08:51-0:08:56</a>:</strong>  Because like you said, it had gone through many previous owners, many of whom had kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:08:56">0:08:56-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  of deforested the terrain, and others who had planted perhaps different crops like avocados,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:08</a>:</strong>  or perhaps used it as pasture land in the past.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:08">0:09:08-0:09:10</a>:</strong>  And you've got quite a diversity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:10">0:09:10-0:09:19</a>:</strong>  Most people who we bought the land from were planting vegetables for export, basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:19">0:09:19-0:09:20</a>:</strong>  on certain seasons.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:20">0:09:20-0:09:24</a>:</strong>  And then on the other seasons, they were planting corn and beans, their staple foods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:29</a>:</strong>  But everything was done non-organic, and therefore we had to go, we've been doing processes to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:29">0:09:29-0:09:36</a>:</strong>  clean out all the trails, all the traces of all those things, by letting it weed, collecting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:36">0:09:36-0:09:44</a>:</strong>  then the weeds, planting certain types of crops that absorb these nutrients, and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:44">0:09:44-0:09:52</a>:</strong>  using it for animal feed, and then getting into actual planting of crops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:52">0:09:52-0:09:57</a>:</strong>  And what kind of plants have you been using for the remediation of the land?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:57">0:09:57-0:09:59</a>:</strong>  We've been using like daikons.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:09:59">0:09:59-0:10:05</a>:</strong>  Those seem to be very well, you know, they're like these big roots, radishes, and they tend<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:05">0:10:05-0:10:13</a>:</strong>  to loosen up the soil, absorb all the heavy metals, and any salts, and all sorts of other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:13">0:10:13-0:10:17</a>:</strong>  stuff left behind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:17">0:10:17-0:10:23</a>:</strong>  So we've been using that, and fodderbeets, I guess that's how you call them, fodderbeets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:23">0:10:23-0:10:29</a>:</strong>  So those have been the main ones, followed by some legumes that are like, you can use<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:29">0:10:29-0:10:32</a>:</strong>  as kind of like a chop and drop thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:32">0:10:32-0:10:38</a>:</strong>  So those have been more of the things we've been using to clean out the area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:38">0:10:38-0:10:44</a>:</strong>  Plus we left it at least a year, over a year, just weed out, and then took out all those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:44">0:10:44-0:10:48</a>:</strong>  weeds and composted them somewhere else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:48">0:10:48-0:10:51</a>:</strong>  And now you're saying you're feeding those a lot to your animals as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:51">0:10:51-0:10:55</a>:</strong>  You've got quite a number of different animals, and tell me a little bit about how you manage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:55">0:10:55-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  those in rotation and with different types of feed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so we have pigs, we have lamb, we have ducks, we have chickens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:06">0:11:06-0:11:08</a>:</strong>  Those are the animals we're running out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:08">0:11:08-0:11:16</a>:</strong>  And yeah, we just have them fenced in, in decent sized areas, and every so often we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  move them from one fenced area to the next, and then to the next, and behind either comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:23</a>:</strong>  another animal or a crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:23">0:11:23-0:11:28</a>:</strong>  And then when it's greened again, we keep moving them back in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:28">0:11:28-0:11:33</a>:</strong>  We use the water from the spring, and 50% of the time we're using corn that we grow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:33">0:11:33-0:11:39</a>:</strong>  at the farm, the other 50 we have to outsource it, try to get the best that we can when we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:39">0:11:39-0:11:41</a>:</strong>  not growing our own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:47</a>:</strong>  And we're starting to do all our hay bales so we can have a lot of dry food during the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:47">0:11:47-0:11:52</a>:</strong>  rainy season when they need dry food or else only green food's not enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:52">0:11:52-0:11:57</a>:</strong>  So we're working on trying to be as sustainable as possible with these animals, trying to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:11:57">0:11:57-0:12:01</a>:</strong>  feed them as much as possible from the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:01">0:12:01-0:12:04</a>:</strong>  So that's really what we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:04">0:12:04-0:12:09</a>:</strong>  The only animals that I'm not too happy about are pigs when they're breastfeeding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:09">0:12:09-0:12:16</a>:</strong>  I gotta kinda give them a supplement, but it's only during the milking process when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:16">0:12:16-0:12:17</a>:</strong>  they're feeding their babies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:17">0:12:17-0:12:24</a>:</strong>  They tend to go very, very lean when they have 10, 12 piglets sucking on it 24-7.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:24">0:12:24-0:12:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I can imagine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:27">0:12:27-0:12:31</a>:</strong>  Now tell me about the unique situation of your water resources there, because you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:31">0:12:31-0:12:35</a>:</strong>  in the wet-dry tropics that I've talked about a lot on this podcast in the past, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:35">0:12:35-0:12:39</a>:</strong>  it was a very similar climate to what we had there at the lake.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:39">0:12:39-0:12:43</a>:</strong>  But even though you get a huge amount of water in a certain season, it's almost completely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:43">0:12:43-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  dry for about half of the year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:50</a>:</strong>  And given those big changes in elevation, how are you making sure that water gets where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:50">0:12:50-0:12:52</a>:</strong>  it needs to on the land?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:12:52">0:12:52-0:13:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so one of the main things is we're applying swales from all the roads where the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:03">0:13:03-0:13:07</a>:</strong>  carves come in into the property, plus in certain areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:07">0:13:07-0:13:09</a>:</strong>  It's such a big property, it's hard to do it on the whole thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:09">0:13:09-0:13:14</a>:</strong>  But we're moving little by little, putting swales here and there, some key lines.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:14">0:13:14-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  But also we're planting lots of forest, and planting lots of trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:25</a>:</strong>  I've been learning a lot about planting trees in that area, it's different everywhere you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:25">0:13:25-0:13:26</a>:</strong>  go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:26">0:13:26-0:13:31</a>:</strong>  But let's say this year my goal was 10,000 trees, we weren't really able to plant 10,000,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:31">0:13:31-0:13:32</a>:</strong>  we got 5,000 in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:32">0:13:32-0:13:35</a>:</strong>  So that's really good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:35">0:13:35-0:13:37</a>:</strong>  I'm still happy with that amount.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:37">0:13:37-0:13:41</a>:</strong>  The difference between this and last year's, even though we planted a lot of trees last<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:41">0:13:41-0:13:47</a>:</strong>  year, is last couple years we've been planting lots of trees and the majority have been dying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:48</a>:</strong>  out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:48">0:13:48-0:13:50</a>:</strong>  We've been planting either too late in the rainy season and they're not sticking, or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:50">0:13:50-0:13:56</a>:</strong>  we've been planting too early in the rainy season and the weeds outgrow the trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:13:56">0:13:56-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  So this year we invested in some weed whackers, a lot more weed whackers and stuff to keep<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:09</a>:</strong>  the weeds down when we're planting the trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:09">0:14:09-0:14:14</a>:</strong>  So we can tell already that most of them are going to succeed this year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:14">0:14:14-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  So that's good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:22</a>:</strong>  So our nurseries, basically we're not buying trees and we're not buying seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:22">0:14:22-0:14:25</a>:</strong>  That's what happens most of the time is most people are planting trees that are not from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:25">0:14:25-0:14:32</a>:</strong>  the area or are reforesting with non-native species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:32">0:14:32-0:14:39</a>:</strong>  They're more like species that you can take advantage of, like lumber species, and therefore<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:39">0:14:39-0:14:45</a>:</strong>  you disrupt a little bit, if not a lot, the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:45">0:14:45-0:14:51</a>:</strong>  So the idea is we're planting special species of the area where we're getting our own seed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:51">0:14:51-0:14:58</a>:</strong>  from our forests, we're making our own nurseries, and fortunately the species that we have in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:14:58">0:14:58-0:15:06</a>:</strong>  our native forest there, which are cloud forests, we're at 2100 meters elevation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:06">0:15:06-0:15:11</a>:</strong>  So I guess not sure what that is in feet, but I'm guessing it's like 8,000 feet or something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:11">0:15:11-0:15:13</a>:</strong>  like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:13">0:15:13-0:15:15</a>:</strong>  Maybe something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:15">0:15:15-0:15:21</a>:</strong>  But basically the species that we have in that native forest are species that put water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:21">0:15:21-0:15:28</a>:</strong>  into the ground and not suck water out of the ground, like eucalyptus or pine forests<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:28">0:15:28-0:15:34</a>:</strong>  and cypress, which that's what most people plant in this area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:34">0:15:34-0:15:40</a>:</strong>  But unfortunately they're great lumber, but instead of putting water in the ground, they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:40">0:15:40-0:15:54</a>:</strong>  drying the ground up, and it's a very basic biodiversity that comes out of those species<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:54">0:15:54-0:15:58</a>:</strong>  in that area, because those are great trees from even much higher elevation in areas where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:15:58">0:15:58-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  there's less biodiversity, so those would do well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:06</a>:</strong>  But in our area, which is a cloud forest, which has lots of biodiversity, if you plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:06">0:16:06-0:16:14</a>:</strong>  a monocrop of those trees, you get rid of too many species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:14">0:16:14-0:16:19</a>:</strong>  So it's better to plant the local ones which retain more variety.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:19">0:16:19-0:16:21</a>:</strong>  Sure, sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:21">0:16:21-0:16:25</a>:</strong>  Let's step back a little bit, because I know that there are incentives for reforestation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:25">0:16:25-0:16:27</a>:</strong>  in Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:27">0:16:27-0:16:32</a>:</strong>  The government is actually doing a fairly decent job about giving monetary incentives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:32">0:16:32-0:16:37</a>:</strong>  to farmers who have otherwise either cut down their own forests or have land where it has<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:37">0:16:37-0:16:44</a>:</strong>  been deforested, and the money is significant enough to actually offer a really good motivation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:44">0:16:44-0:16:49</a>:</strong>  especially if they're doing mostly cash crops and fairly subsistence farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:49">0:16:49-0:16:55</a>:</strong>  So where are the benefits to these policies, and where does it kind of hold back, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:55">0:16:55-0:16:58</a>:</strong>  when you're talking about biodiversity in these cases?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:16:58">0:16:58-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's a complicated thing to touch, but basically I'm not a big fan of those incentives.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:15</a>:</strong>  I do do a little bit of them, because it helps you get a big ally in case of a neighbor trying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:15">0:17:15-0:17:21</a>:</strong>  to do something wrong or something happening nearby, you can put a little bit of halt and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:21">0:17:21-0:17:22</a>:</strong>  pressure on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:22">0:17:22-0:17:31</a>:</strong>  It's kind of a weird system, as though you have to hire a forest engineer that's certified<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:31">0:17:31-0:17:42</a>:</strong>  by them, which you have to pay, and they're quite expensive to set up the program.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:42">0:17:42-0:17:47</a>:</strong>  My thing that I've seen about it is the money you're getting, it really just goes to pay<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:47">0:17:47-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  the project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:51</a>:</strong>  It's very hard to make money off of those systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:51">0:17:51-0:17:56</a>:</strong>  They're very good at just covering the costs of maintaining the forest and any expenses<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:56">0:17:56-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  that need to go with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  But it's not like, oh, here's a forest, I got 20 acres, let's put it under the preserve<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:05</a>:</strong>  thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:05">0:18:05-0:18:09</a>:</strong>  You're not making money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:09">0:18:09-0:18:15</a>:</strong>  The money comes when the project is over and you're able to harvest what's there, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:15">0:18:15-0:18:17</a>:</strong>  is what most of these projects are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:23</a>:</strong>  Most of these projects are not set up to indefinite protect the forest forever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:28</a>:</strong>  There are more projects like, okay, let's reforest with pine or with cypress and stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:28">0:18:28-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  like this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  Then 10 years later, 20 years later, 30 years later, you're harvesting and that's where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:35</a>:</strong>  you're getting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:35">0:18:35-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  Then you replant trees, because you have to replant there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  You can't just clear cut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  You're covering your cost to the point when you can harvest your yield there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:54</a>:</strong>  That's where it's at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:54">0:18:54-0:18:58</a>:</strong>  For someone like me, where I'm not in the plan of harvesting, I'm more in the plan of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:18:58">0:18:58-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  planting trees that are not the species that...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:08</a>:</strong>  What really happens is most of their projects, I'd say 90 if not more, their percentage is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:08">0:19:08-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  like three or four species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:15</a>:</strong>  In my area, the species that they work with is eucalyptus, cypress, and pine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:15">0:19:15-0:19:20</a>:</strong>  Tropical, much warmer climates, it would be teak or mahogany.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:24</a>:</strong>  The amount of species that they're setting up is very little compared to what a real<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:24">0:19:24-0:19:26</a>:</strong>  forest offers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:26">0:19:26-0:19:30</a>:</strong>  One of them is because there's not nurseries that sell other varieties and there's no studies<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:30">0:19:30-0:19:31</a>:</strong>  for the other ones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:31">0:19:31-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  They haven't really set up things for those other things because the programs are mostly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:41</a>:</strong>  for planting and then when they're ready, you're going to cut and take the yield out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:41">0:19:41-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  Except for there's a different one which is protecting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  Protecting is a different type of incentive where it's like you already have a virgin<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:49</a>:</strong>  forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:49">0:19:49-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  You put it under a reserve and therefore they pay you for that and there you keep what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:56</a>:</strong>  there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:19:56">0:19:56-0:20:00</a>:</strong>  That's where the real biodiverse and stuff is happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:00">0:20:00-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  Where you're planting trees, it's very different to what I'm doing because I'm planting trees<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:08</a>:</strong>  that they've never even heard of, I think.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:08">0:20:08-0:20:10</a>:</strong>  Very rare species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:10">0:20:10-0:20:15</a>:</strong>  So I'm not going to really be getting a yield off of this so I'm just covering my costs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:15">0:20:15-0:20:21</a>:</strong>  My yield off of this which I'm switching is agro-tourism where I can take tourists, walk<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:21">0:20:21-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  them through there and show them birds and wildlife and that type of...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:30</a>:</strong>  That's going to be my yield out of the situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:30">0:20:30-0:20:34</a>:</strong>  But the other yield that I'm going to be getting off of it is putting more water into my soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:34">0:20:34-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  because the trees that I'm planting are actually water friendly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:37">0:20:37-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  Put water into the ground while as all these programs of reforestation for all these other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  places where it's for lumber, they're not water friendly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  They're actually sucking up the water from the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:20:54</a>:</strong>  I think their program, there's many things and there's a lot of loopholes in the system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:54">0:20:54-0:20:57</a>:</strong>  but at least they're doing something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:57">0:20:57-0:20:58</a>:</strong>  It's moving forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:58">0:20:58-0:20:59</a>:</strong>  It is taking off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:20:59">0:20:59-0:21:05</a>:</strong>  There's a lot more people being interested in the situation and that's in general really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:05">0:21:05-0:21:06</a>:</strong>  great for the country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:06">0:21:06-0:21:09</a>:</strong>  So I think we're moving towards the right direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:09">0:21:09-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:16</a>:</strong>  Now tell me about the observation process that helped you to decide which of these kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:16">0:21:16-0:21:20</a>:</strong>  of rarer and native species you wanted to propagate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:20">0:21:20-0:21:24</a>:</strong>  Because like you said, it took you a while to kind of figure out, mostly because a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:24">0:21:24-0:21:28</a>:</strong>  of them are not available in nurseries or perhaps don't have a lot of studies or information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:28">0:21:28-0:21:31</a>:</strong>  that you can look up to get answers from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:31">0:21:31-0:21:35</a>:</strong>  And if I remember correctly, you went around with a lot of local people from that area<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:35">0:21:35-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  and that community who know the forest well to observe and figure out which of those kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  of kept water in the soil, which were good habitat for biodiversity within like the birds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  and the fauna of the area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  Tell me a little bit about that process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:52">0:21:52-0:21:54</a>:</strong>  So it's just a lot of observation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:54">0:21:54-0:21:58</a>:</strong>  I've been in that area for about eight years and I just started planting trees about three<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:58">0:21:58-0:21:59</a>:</strong>  years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:21:59">0:21:59-0:22:05</a>:</strong>  So it was about a five year observation before I knew what type of trees I've wanted to plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:05">0:22:05-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  I'd say 80% of the trees are native.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:15</a>:</strong>  I am introducing some other types of species for beneficial things, but mostly working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:15">0:22:15-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  with what I got there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:20</a>:</strong>  I was saying, okay, what do birds eat in that area?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:20">0:22:20-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  What do wildlife eat in that area?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  If you want to bring in wildlife and birds and all that, that's the first thing you got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:32</a>:</strong>  to keep planting, you want more food, more abundance for them, shelter also, and therefore<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:32">0:22:32-0:22:35</a>:</strong>  those were important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:35">0:22:35-0:22:41</a>:</strong>  I kept seeing what was growing naturally near the water sources and I figured those were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:41">0:22:41-0:22:47</a>:</strong>  the water, the trees that were attracting water and we were discussing with the locals<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:47">0:22:47-0:22:55</a>:</strong>  and everybody, they were in Concord or what you call it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:22:55">0:22:55-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  They were in agreement with me and therefore I had to start then wondering when was the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:05</a>:</strong>  time when they're putting out seeds because each species is a different time when they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:05">0:23:05-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  putting out seeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:10</a>:</strong>  And then trials as to how to germinate them and it wasn't easy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:10">0:23:10-0:23:15</a>:</strong>  Sometimes we would just wait for the seeds to fall on the ground, sprout there naturally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  and then transplant the babies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:23</a>:</strong>  After many years we've been getting better and better and I now got more ideas of how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:23">0:23:23-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  to do it even better next year and hopefully this will keep growing forever with this wisdom.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:37</a>:</strong>  We're planting about 14 varieties of local species of big trees, big trees that will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:37">0:23:37-0:23:39</a>:</strong>  grow the very big ones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:39">0:23:39-0:23:44</a>:</strong>  Plus we're planting maybe another six varieties of medium sized trees that do well under the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:44">0:23:44-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  shade of the bigger ones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  Because everything from nut trees to hardwoods to fruit trees to legume trees, they all play<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:03</a>:</strong>  up all together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:03">0:24:03-0:24:07</a>:</strong>  They play a good part, different levels.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:07">0:24:07-0:24:12</a>:</strong>  They all serve different functions in the whole system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:12">0:24:12-0:24:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:15">0:24:15-0:24:21</a>:</strong>  So we're just not playing with one species and mono cropping it and then when the time's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:21">0:24:21-0:24:27</a>:</strong>  ready to harvest, you harvest, you clear cut and then you plant again, probably the same<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:29</a>:</strong>  species again or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:29">0:24:29-0:24:34</a>:</strong>  So that's usually what the incentive programs are looking like these days for reforestation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:34">0:24:34-0:24:40</a>:</strong>  It's not like, oh, we're going to plant a very cool forest with multiple variety and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:40">0:24:40-0:24:41</a>:</strong>  then never harvest it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:41">0:24:41-0:24:44</a>:</strong>  If only that were the case.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:44">0:24:44-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  So I think where these programs come in and help a lot, you don't really have costs and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:57</a>:</strong>  then when you harvest, it's the big one because you don't have to, most of the time what you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:24:57">0:24:57-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  were doing, it's an investment for 10, 20, 30 years and then you start seeing some, so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:04</a>:</strong>  then you get the big harvest and then it pays off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:04">0:25:04-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  Hopefully it pays off for all you've invested in the last 30 years and then more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:17</a>:</strong>  With these forests, there's a few things because usually you plant very tight and then at five<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:17">0:25:17-0:25:23</a>:</strong>  years you do what we call a raleo, what you call like you thin out and then there you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:23">0:25:23-0:25:26</a>:</strong>  get something and depending on the type of species, what do you do with that thin out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:26">0:25:26-0:25:28</a>:</strong>  It could be posts, it could be this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:28">0:25:28-0:25:33</a>:</strong>  Then you do a second thin out like around 10 years and then those could be beams and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:33">0:25:33-0:25:38</a>:</strong>  even bigger posts and then you do like a third, like around 15 or 20 years and then those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:38">0:25:38-0:25:43</a>:</strong>  can actually get, like already start with the chainsaw, getting bored, doing a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:43">0:25:43-0:25:48</a>:</strong>  bit more cuts of lumber and then by 20, 30 years, depending on the species, you're harvesting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:25:51</a>:</strong>  the big ones and that's where you're getting the stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:51">0:25:51-0:25:57</a>:</strong>  So I mean there is some money in between doing, but the idea behind the incentives is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:57">0:25:57-0:25:59</a>:</strong>  it covers those things and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:25:59">0:25:59-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  So for every tree you plant, you're going to have to, for every tree you cut, you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:02">0:26:02-0:26:06</a>:</strong>  going to have to keep planting and there's always studies and all this type of stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:06">0:26:06-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  and the way these studies, they're not set up for very big projects, they're set up more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:14</a>:</strong>  for smaller projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:14">0:26:14-0:26:19</a>:</strong>  So usually they'll pay you full price for let's say 15 hectares, which I'm guessing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:19">0:26:19-0:26:26</a>:</strong>  that's about 45 acres.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:26">0:26:26-0:26:32</a>:</strong>  So 45 acres, they will pay you full price on a project that's 45 acres, but if it gets<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:32">0:26:32-0:26:36</a>:</strong>  bigger than 45 acres, then it really drastically decreases.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:36">0:26:36-0:26:41</a>:</strong>  So basically you get paid full price for 45 acres and for every acre above that, so if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:41">0:26:41-0:26:47</a>:</strong>  you have a 100 acre program or a 1000 acre program, let's say every acre after the 45<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:47">0:26:47-0:26:51</a>:</strong>  you get a fifth or a tenth the amount.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:51">0:26:51-0:26:59</a>:</strong>  So if you were getting $100 per acre a year, that's $4500 a year, that's full price, then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:26:59">0:26:59-0:27:05</a>:</strong>  all of a sudden you're getting $10 an acre after that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:05">0:27:05-0:27:12</a>:</strong>  So what that does, it's like big projects are not really happening because people would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:12">0:27:12-0:27:20</a>:</strong>  rather do one year or two, you know they do multiple small projects and they only let<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:20">0:27:20-0:27:27</a>:</strong>  you put in so many small projects a year as a person or an identity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:30</a>:</strong>  So you gotta wait until the next year and then put in another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:30">0:27:30-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  So I mean it's set up, and in a certain way it's good because it's set up for all these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:41</a>:</strong>  more local people who are the people who really need to take care of the forest to set these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:41">0:27:41-0:27:42</a>:</strong>  programs up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:42">0:27:42-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  So yeah, it's interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:48</a>:</strong>  We'll see what happens in the future with more ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:48">0:27:48-0:27:56</a>:</strong>  I've been talking with them a lot and telling them that I want to start out a big nursery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:27:56">0:27:56-0:28:00</a>:</strong>  and have all these types of trees and eventually when they have programs that don't want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:00">0:28:00-0:28:05</a>:</strong>  go with the standard which is planting these lumber trees and they want to kind of go with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:05">0:28:05-0:28:09</a>:</strong>  what I'm doing, is either teaching them how to source their own seeds and their own nurseries<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:09">0:28:09-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  and all this, or myself having a big nursery and maybe I can supply some of these other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:19</a>:</strong>  projects with these more local native species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:19">0:28:19-0:28:23</a>:</strong>  That's longer down the road, but that's kind of where I'm heading towards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:23">0:28:23-0:28:27</a>:</strong>  That's kind of an idea of mine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:27">0:28:27-0:28:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:28">0:28:28-0:28:32</a>:</strong>  Seems like there's a lot of potential there, but it requires a good knowledge of how the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:32">0:28:32-0:28:36</a>:</strong>  systems work there, where the incentives are, where the limitations are, and that just kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:36">0:28:36-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  of comes from being there all the time and talking with locals and navigating the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:43</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:43">0:28:43-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  So let's talk about now some of the ways that you can incentivize this type of reforestation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  without having to rely on government subsidies or programs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:28:53">0:28:53-0:29:03</a>:</strong>  Now you have a unique idea of turning this into more of a tourism or hospitality enterprise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:03">0:29:03-0:29:06</a>:</strong>  And tell me a little bit about how you see that working or developing over time, although<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:06">0:29:06-0:29:10</a>:</strong>  you may not have all the pieces set up yet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:10">0:29:10-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, you know, I think the future of tourism is moving towards sustainable, biodiverse,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:23</a>:</strong>  pro-tourism.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:23">0:29:23-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  I think people less and less want to go see nature and these type of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:36</a>:</strong>  It's not everybody, but it's a growth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:36">0:29:36-0:29:41</a>:</strong>  These tour destination areas are becoming more and more like, okay, where is their forest?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:41">0:29:41-0:29:42</a>:</strong>  Where is their nature?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:42">0:29:42-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  Where can I connect?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:45</a>:</strong>  Yeah, they're becoming increasingly rare.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:45">0:29:45-0:29:48</a>:</strong>  I think it's a really good bet moving forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:48">0:29:48-0:29:53</a>:</strong>  I mean, we see in so many news stories and current events how much forests are being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:53">0:29:53-0:29:58</a>:</strong>  lost constantly and the biodiversity and the access to them with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:58">0:29:58-0:29:59</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:29:59">0:29:59-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  So I think that's a future thing for business, unfortunately, because it should be nice to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:10</a>:</strong>  just go wherever you want and see nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:10">0:30:10-0:30:14</a>:</strong>  And especially nature where you understand nature, because a lot of people don't understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:14">0:30:14-0:30:15</a>:</strong>  nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:15">0:30:15-0:30:17</a>:</strong>  So it's nice to go somewhere where there might be a guide or someone who can tell you about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:17">0:30:17-0:30:18</a>:</strong>  what's happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:18">0:30:18-0:30:23</a>:</strong>  Because what I see is different than what someone who's never been in my area sees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:23">0:30:23-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  So it's like they would just walk and kind of be clueless of half the stuff unless you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:32</a>:</strong>  really know about the area or about the species or what's happening there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:32">0:30:32-0:30:37</a>:</strong>  And so these type of agrotourisms where there's like a guide or someone talking about the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:37">0:30:37-0:30:43</a>:</strong>  situation I think is good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:43">0:30:43-0:30:49</a>:</strong>  And also the idea is for healthiness and awareness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:49">0:30:49-0:30:55</a>:</strong>  So talking about awareness and also simultaneously you're out there in nature, you're going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:30:56</a>:</strong>  eat healthy food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:30:56">0:30:56-0:31:01</a>:</strong>  You're going to have a very nice area to stay in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:01">0:31:01-0:31:02</a>:</strong>  You're away from noise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:02">0:31:02-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  You're going to hear birds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:06</a>:</strong>  You're not going to hear the highway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:06">0:31:06-0:31:12</a>:</strong>  You're not going to hear all sorts of things that come with being in a city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:12">0:31:12-0:31:20</a>:</strong>  And if you're lucky you get to see other types of...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:20">0:31:20-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's kind of where I'm pushing for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:30</a>:</strong>  You escape for...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:30">0:31:30-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  And not just international tourism but local tourism as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of people in the city who have money and just never are in a forest or never<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:43</a>:</strong>  are in a city and they want to get out for the weekend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:43">0:31:43-0:31:46</a>:</strong>  And the beach could be a destination.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:31:47</a>:</strong>  The lake could be a destination.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:47">0:31:47-0:31:50</a>:</strong>  But the mountains could be a destination as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:50">0:31:50-0:31:55</a>:</strong>  And yeah, you go out there, you eat healthy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:55">0:31:55-0:31:56</a>:</strong>  There's retreats.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:31:56">0:31:56-0:32:03</a>:</strong>  We can bring in special workshops whether it's meditation or whether it's yoga or whether<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:03">0:32:03-0:32:07</a>:</strong>  it's people who are not cleansing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:07">0:32:07-0:32:09</a>:</strong>  There's so much stuff out there nowadays.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:09">0:32:09-0:32:12</a>:</strong>  Just bringing the right person out there and offering the workshop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:12">0:32:12-0:32:19</a>:</strong>  And in that type of environment, it's really nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:19">0:32:19-0:32:23</a>:</strong>  And then at the same time, not only nature, but you can see about the crops and how we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:23">0:32:23-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  grow the crops and how we become a sustainable project producing our own seeds, producing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:31</a>:</strong>  our own fertilizer and what you're eating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:31">0:32:31-0:32:41</a>:</strong>  And it's this whole lifestyle, this whole system, so you can get more aware of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:41">0:32:41-0:32:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:42">0:32:42-0:32:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:43">0:32:43-0:32:49</a>:</strong>  And the nice thing is, perhaps, I think you know the owners of Hobbitonango too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:49">0:32:49-0:32:57</a>:</strong>  The guys who took a risk on a concept up in the mountains outside of Antigua, similar<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:32:57">0:32:57-0:33:02</a>:</strong>  distance in some ways from where your guys are situated and at this point they've got,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:02">0:33:02-0:33:07</a>:</strong>  they say 70 to 80% of their clientele from Guatemala, domestic tourism.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:07">0:33:07-0:33:10</a>:</strong>  And when they started that, they didn't really have any ambition that there would be that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:10">0:33:10-0:33:14</a>:</strong>  much interest within the local communities to go out and see natural areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:14">0:33:14-0:33:17</a>:</strong>  But now that's their bread and butter clientele.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:17">0:33:17-0:33:21</a>:</strong>  And it's really nice to see that there's kind of an awakening towards appreciation of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:24</a>:</strong>  natural resources within the country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:24">0:33:24-0:33:28</a>:</strong>  Whereas before I think there was maybe more of a value placed on going to the beach or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:28">0:33:28-0:33:34</a>:</strong>  going to other countries and starting to recognize how rich the ecosystems within that country<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:34">0:33:34-0:33:36</a>:</strong>  are themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:36">0:33:36-0:33:37</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:37">0:33:37-0:33:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:39">0:33:39-0:33:43</a>:</strong>  So now let's talk a little bit about the unique circumstances that you have there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:43">0:33:43-0:33:47</a>:</strong>  We talked a little bit about the terrain, the microclimate, the elevation where you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:47">0:33:47-0:33:48</a>:</strong>  are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:48">0:33:48-0:33:50</a>:</strong>  Let's talk about some of the challenges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:50">0:33:50-0:33:53</a>:</strong>  I lost you a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:53">0:33:53-0:33:54</a>:</strong>  You lost me there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:54">0:33:54-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:55">0:33:55-0:33:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:56">0:33:56-0:33:57</a>:</strong>  Start out again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:57">0:33:57-0:33:58</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:33:58">0:33:58-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  So let's, let's talk now a little bit about the challenges that you face in that scenario<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:06</a>:</strong>  because one of the first times that I went out to see the site on Paramos, it was still<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:06">0:34:06-0:34:12</a>:</strong>  recovering from a big ash plume that came from a volcano, which I mean, you're right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:12">0:34:12-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  in the area of that volcano.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:20</a>:</strong>  And there are a lot of things, not just as far as like natural disasters that can threaten<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:20">0:34:20-0:34:24</a>:</strong>  the ecosystems there, especially when they've become brittle through deforestation, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  also some of the difficulties of the way that your neighbors and other people in the area<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  are managing their land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:35</a>:</strong>  So can you talk about some of the challenges that you have in your reforestation efforts?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:35">0:34:35-0:34:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:36">0:34:36-0:34:43</a>:</strong>  Like you said, neighbors who are just in the opposite instead of like planting trees or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:43">0:34:43-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  in the cutting trees, you know, so it's very complicated with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:34:50</a>:</strong>  Basically yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:50">0:34:50-0:34:52</a>:</strong>  That whole volcano thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:52">0:34:52-0:34:56</a>:</strong>  I mean, we're not really in the, in the line, like you said, it just really depends on the,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:56">0:34:56-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  on the winds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  If it blows up and the winds are on the direction that we're at, then that's where we get some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:02">0:35:02-0:35:03</a>:</strong>  troubles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:03">0:35:03-0:35:07</a>:</strong>  But it's gotta be when it blows up hard because a little, a little, a little thing, even though<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:07">0:35:07-0:35:11</a>:</strong>  the winds are towards our direction, but that will happen once every five years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:11">0:35:11-0:35:13</a>:</strong>  And so that's something we have to put up with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:13">0:35:13-0:35:15</a>:</strong>  I think the forest doesn't get bugged with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:15">0:35:15-0:35:17</a>:</strong>  I think we didn't have any issues with the forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:17">0:35:17-0:35:19</a>:</strong>  So planting forest is great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:19">0:35:19-0:35:24</a>:</strong>  It doesn't, it's a, it's a, the agro-tourism and all that doesn't affect anything because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:24">0:35:24-0:35:26</a>:</strong>  doesn't really ruin the forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:26">0:35:26-0:35:32</a>:</strong>  What it does is it ruins our, you know, our vegetables and sometimes our fruit trees,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:32">0:35:32-0:35:36</a>:</strong>  if they're on flower or they have fruit on them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:36">0:35:36-0:35:38</a>:</strong>  So that's where we have to watch out a bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:38">0:35:38-0:35:40</a>:</strong>  It doesn't really kill the fruit trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:40">0:35:40-0:35:43</a>:</strong>  It just, we lose the harvest for the next six months.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:43">0:35:43-0:35:46</a>:</strong>  So those are some of the challenges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:46">0:35:46-0:35:50</a>:</strong>  As people cut down trees, like neighbors cut down trees, well there's less water and less<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:50">0:35:50-0:35:54</a>:</strong>  water and that's why I'm planting more, more trees and more trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:54">0:35:54-0:35:58</a>:</strong>  And so I think those are the biggest challenges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:35:58">0:35:58-0:36:04</a>:</strong>  Again, I think those are what we're finding with the challenges more and more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:04">0:36:04-0:36:09</a>:</strong>  And you know, neighbors planting with non-organic products and so where you're planting, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:09">0:36:09-0:36:12</a>:</strong>  gotta make sure you're not downhill from these people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:12">0:36:12-0:36:16</a>:</strong>  That there's, that your water source is not contaminated and stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:16">0:36:16-0:36:21</a>:</strong>  But we're in a pretty good spot so I think we're covered from all that, those areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:21">0:36:21-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  But I think those are the most challenging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:28</a>:</strong>  And then at the same time that the community or the government wants to work with you instead<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:28">0:36:28-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  of being a barrier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:34</a>:</strong>  I think those are the, always the biggest challenges as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:34">0:36:34-0:36:35</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:35">0:36:35-0:36:40</a>:</strong>  Now with that in mind, do you have a strategy or an ambition to reach out to larger parts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:40">0:36:40-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  of the community or even other parts of Guatemala and the surrounding areas to kind of bring<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:50</a>:</strong>  this idea of how someone could reinvigorate a natural forest, especially for the long<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:36:55</a>:</strong>  term and view it through a different type of profitability lens rather than just as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:55">0:36:55-0:36:59</a>:</strong>  the value of the lumber itself?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:36:59">0:36:59-0:37:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I'm trying to work with neighbors who want to work with me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:03">0:37:03-0:37:07</a>:</strong>  Thing is they're on a day to day thing, you know, they're, they don't, they're not on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:07">0:37:07-0:37:13</a>:</strong>  a three, four, five year vision, you know, they're like, hey, what can I do next month<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:13">0:37:13-0:37:14</a>:</strong>  to make my money?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:14">0:37:14-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  You know, so it's hard for them to try to sell them something, you know, it's hard for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:21</a>:</strong>  them to believe that something's going to happen really great if we, you know, two,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:21">0:37:21-0:37:24</a>:</strong>  three, five years down the line.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:24">0:37:24-0:37:28</a>:</strong>  So and I, and sometimes I don't blame them, you know, they need to feed their families,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:28">0:37:28-0:37:32</a>:</strong>  they need to do stuff they need to, if they don't, they might not be around the next month,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:32">0:37:32-0:37:36</a>:</strong>  you know, so I understand where they're coming from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:36">0:37:36-0:37:40</a>:</strong>  But I'm trying to work with people and see who does want to work with us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:40">0:37:40-0:37:45</a>:</strong>  And part of it is I'm donating trees to people who want to work with us so they can keep<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:45">0:37:45-0:37:49</a>:</strong>  planting with the native species because they don't have their nurseries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:49">0:37:49-0:37:56</a>:</strong>  And second of all, just reaching out and seeing, you know, the community also as well reaching<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:37:56">0:37:56-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  out who wants trees and donating them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:06</a>:</strong>  I also developing good ties with them with simple things like just borrowing the weed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:06">0:38:06-0:38:17</a>:</strong>  whacker to a local church, you know, and, you know, they need some something, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:17">0:38:17-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  and then just reaching out so they know that they can count on me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  So when I'm talking to them, it's not, you know, they don't see me as like, oh, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  bullshit, you know, they're like, hey, this guy really wants to help out and he really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:26">0:38:26-0:38:30</a>:</strong>  sees this as a potential maybe we should believe them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:35</a>:</strong>  You know, it's a very, very slow long process to gain trust in these areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:35">0:38:35-0:38:39</a>:</strong>  And then I got two or three good guys I'm working with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:44</a>:</strong>  And then I think once they start doing it, I think other people will reach out more and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:44">0:38:44-0:38:49</a>:</strong>  then they'll see, you know, and I think it can keep growing slowly, but, you know, paving<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:49">0:38:49-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  the path correctly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:38:58</a>:</strong>  And then, yeah, and then also with schools, I'm starting to develop a program with schools,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:38:58">0:38:58-0:39:05</a>:</strong>  not necessarily in the area, but more like schools here in Antigua and where they want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:05">0:39:05-0:39:08</a>:</strong>  to plant trees, you know, and it was very easy for them to go plant trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:08">0:39:08-0:39:12</a>:</strong>  But then what I've realized, planting trees is very easy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:12">0:39:12-0:39:15</a>:</strong>  It's that you just go and plant it, you buy a tree, you plant it and boom, there it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:15">0:39:15-0:39:19</a>:</strong>  done and you, the kids don't get any attachment to the tree you forget.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:19">0:39:19-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  And part of the planting the tree is the three years after you plant it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:26</a>:</strong>  I mean, it's not just, oh, I'm going to go plant the tree and there it is, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:26">0:39:26-0:39:29</a>:</strong>  one out of 10 will survive if you do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:29">0:39:29-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  So there's a lot of maintenance and care for the tree after you plant it in the mountains.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:38</a>:</strong>  So that's something I'm trying to teach them the whole cycle because, and the only way<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:38">0:39:38-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  to do that is to feel an attachment to that tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:45</a>:</strong>  So let's go collect the seeds together with the school.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:45">0:39:45-0:39:50</a>:</strong>  Let's go, let's develop a nursery in the school, let each kid really spend six months to a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:39:52</a>:</strong>  year with that tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:52">0:39:52-0:39:56</a>:</strong>  So when they go plant it, before they go plant it, there's an attachment there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:39:56">0:39:56-0:40:01</a>:</strong>  It's not just like, oh, I just bought it for 10 for a dollar or $2 and I planted it and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:01">0:40:01-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  boom, there it is because most of these kids I'm working with probably have the money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:09</a>:</strong>  And so they, and they're, you know, they don't, $2 is nothing for them, but if you teach them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:09">0:40:09-0:40:13</a>:</strong>  the whole, and then it's a whole year, it's a whole year program in school.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:13">0:40:13-0:40:15</a>:</strong>  It's not just go buy and plant and that's in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:15">0:40:15-0:40:19</a>:</strong>  It's there's, you know, you're going to teach them where the seeds are coming from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:23</a>:</strong>  You're going to teach them how to prepare soil, how to develop a nursery, grow their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:23">0:40:23-0:40:24</a>:</strong>  own tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:24">0:40:24-0:40:27</a>:</strong>  It's going to be, like I said, eight to 10, eight, eight to 10 months, the whole school<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:27">0:40:27-0:40:28</a>:</strong>  year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:28">0:40:28-0:40:32</a>:</strong>  And then maybe the next year when they're, if they are, you know, maybe the next year,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:32">0:40:32-0:40:33</a>:</strong>  that's when they go plant it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:33">0:40:33-0:40:36</a>:</strong>  And so when they plant it, they're losing someone they've been taking care of for that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:36">0:40:36-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  long of a period.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:39</a>:</strong>  They're not going to just forget about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:39">0:40:39-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  They're going to want to go check, make sure their tree, at least a majority of them, a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:47</a>:</strong>  bigger chance are going to go check and make sure their tree is doing well for, until it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:47">0:40:47-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  survives and thrives.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:54</a>:</strong>  And I think, you know, if you can make some type of thing like a Facebook or an Instagram<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:54">0:40:54-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  thing where they're proud of it and they're constantly taking pictures and it reminds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:40:59">0:40:59-0:41:05</a>:</strong>  them and there's, I think they'll be more, and they'll be more educated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:05">0:41:05-0:41:06</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:06">0:41:06-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  No, that's really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:11</a>:</strong>  It's an often overlooked aspect of reforestation or planting trees in general.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:11">0:41:11-0:41:15</a>:</strong>  It's like if you don't make sure that they succeed, and like you said, that three year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:15">0:41:15-0:41:21</a>:</strong>  period is the most crucial, they tend to be able to be more resilient and be able to thrive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:21">0:41:21-0:41:25</a>:</strong>  with less maintenance after you cross that three year mark.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:25">0:41:25-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  But until then, if they're not taken care of, I mean, yeah, this access rate is low<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:33</a>:</strong>  enough that most of the trees that you would plant aren't going to survive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:33">0:41:33-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  And it's kind of just an exercise in futility.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's just more an exercise, you know, and it's like, oh, what are we going to do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:40">0:41:40-0:41:42</a>:</strong>  I need to keep these kids interested.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:42">0:41:42-0:41:43</a>:</strong>  I need to do something different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:43">0:41:43-0:41:47</a>:</strong>  It's kind of like the teacher just, you know, boom, you do something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:47">0:41:47-0:41:51</a>:</strong>  And yeah, it was a great experience, but it's easily forgotten.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:51">0:41:51-0:41:55</a>:</strong>  You know, not many trees are going to survive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:41:55">0:41:55-0:42:03</a>:</strong>  And usually what happens is you go to a nursery and you buy 100 trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:03">0:42:03-0:42:09</a>:</strong>  Within two years, I think it's a much cooler idea to, you know, you come, kids can choose<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:09">0:42:09-0:42:11</a>:</strong>  their different types of species within the forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:13</a>:</strong>  What do you want to plant this tree?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:13">0:42:13-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  And maybe they can grab two or three or four or five different types of trees, species,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:21</a>:</strong>  learn them different, learn about them, you know, what are they good for?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:21">0:42:21-0:42:23</a>:</strong>  See the different rates of growth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:23">0:42:23-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  See this, see that, learn a little bit more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:31</a>:</strong>  And then a year later you got not only one tree to plant, but you got two or three trees<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:31">0:42:31-0:42:32</a>:</strong>  to plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:32">0:42:32-0:42:37</a>:</strong>  And then there's still, yeah, so I'm not necessarily saying high school.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:37">0:42:37-0:42:41</a>:</strong>  It could be even earlier, which it should be, but let's say, I'm just, an example would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:41">0:42:41-0:42:42</a>:</strong>  be high school.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:42">0:42:42-0:42:46</a>:</strong>  So freshman year you could do the nursery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:46">0:42:46-0:42:48</a>:</strong>  Senior year you're planting your trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:48">0:42:48-0:42:50</a>:</strong>  Junior year you're taking care of the trees planted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:50">0:42:50-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  Senior year you're taking care of the trees you planted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:43:00</a>:</strong>  So you know, there's a 80, 90% success rate with planting trees and you learn the whole<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:00">0:43:00-0:43:02</a>:</strong>  cycle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:02">0:43:02-0:43:09</a>:</strong>  And it was a whole program during school, you know, and I think it's kind of a...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:09">0:43:09-0:43:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I love that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:11">0:43:11-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  It's a wonderful idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  Now before we wrap up here, can you give some advice to people who are listening in now?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  And actually I'm really interested for myself too, because reforestation is also a very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:28</a>:</strong>  pressing issue here in Spain as desertification is a major threat to the landscape around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:28">0:43:28-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  How have, like we talked a bit about how you've gone through your landscape and observed which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:37</a>:</strong>  species work there and which you'd want to propagate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:37">0:43:37-0:43:41</a>:</strong>  Tell me a little bit about what you've learned about how to propagate different types of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:41">0:43:41-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  trees and what you've learned in setting up a nursery for maybe uncommon trees or kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:51</a>:</strong>  of on an experimental basis for someone who wants to try this themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:51">0:43:51-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  So the most important is finding the right seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:43:58</a>:</strong>  You got to harvest it at the right time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:43:58">0:43:58-0:44:00</a>:</strong>  It has to be a good seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:00">0:44:00-0:44:05</a>:</strong>  It all starts out with a good... first spotting the right tree, a good healthy tree and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:05">0:44:05-0:44:12</a>:</strong>  getting the right seed and then knowing when that time of the year is and then the second<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:12">0:44:12-0:44:18</a>:</strong>  of all is how to prepare the seed for when you're going to plant it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:18">0:44:18-0:44:22</a>:</strong>  Certain seeds need, depending where you're at, they're going to need like a stratification.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:22">0:44:22-0:44:32</a>:</strong>  They're going to need like a cold season to mitigate winter and then start in spring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:32">0:44:32-0:44:34</a>:</strong>  Some seeds can get planted like here in Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:34">0:44:34-0:44:35</a>:</strong>  You don't need that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:35">0:44:35-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  You can plant right away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:39">0:44:39-0:44:41</a>:</strong>  Then some like direct seeded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:41">0:44:41-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  They don't like being put in little plugs or something and some like being put in plugs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  because it keeps them warmer and safer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:44:56</a>:</strong>  A lot of it is going to be trial and error unless you got someone who's done it in that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:44:56">0:44:56-0:45:00</a>:</strong>  area and can teach you exactly on the species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:00">0:45:00-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  Also rodents, sometimes if you're in an area where there's rodents, if you're planting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:10</a>:</strong>  acorns, let's say if you're planting acorns and you got squirrels or something, you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:10">0:45:10-0:45:14</a>:</strong>  planting a whole bunch of acorns on the ground, you might come back and find that most of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:14">0:45:14-0:45:18</a>:</strong>  them are cracked open and needed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:18">0:45:18-0:45:26</a>:</strong>  You got to be careful with what wildlife is there and what type of seed you're using.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:26">0:45:26-0:45:33</a>:</strong>  So you need some trees like a lot more water than others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:33">0:45:33-0:45:37</a>:</strong>  And then some are more delicate with their root systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:37">0:45:37-0:45:42</a>:</strong>  So you have to be very careful as to when you move them, transplant them to let's say<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:42">0:45:42-0:45:48</a>:</strong>  whatever you're going to use to let them grow for when you can take them to the field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:45:53</a>:</strong>  So those are better to just plant directly on where you can let them grow to the right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:53">0:45:53-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  size.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:46:00</a>:</strong>  So there's a lot of technique behind that and what I would recommend is starting as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:00">0:46:00-0:46:02</a>:</strong>  soon as possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:02">0:46:02-0:46:04</a>:</strong>  Get your hands dirty, go do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:04">0:46:04-0:46:10</a>:</strong>  Even if you don't know anything, go experiment, go read, go look at the internet, go do something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:10">0:46:10-0:46:16</a>:</strong>  and that's the only way you're really going to become an expert at it because anybody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:16">0:46:16-0:46:18</a>:</strong>  can tell you something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:18">0:46:18-0:46:24</a>:</strong>  But those are just guidances to help you through the situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:24">0:46:24-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  At the end, your technique, what you're going to find out, that's the trial and error.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:33</a>:</strong>  That's how you're going to really find out what works for you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:33">0:46:33-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:38</a>:</strong>  Now I'm kind of torn between two methods that I've heard of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:38">0:46:38-0:46:44</a>:</strong>  There's one where you baby the seeds and the saplings with potting soil mix and compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:44">0:46:44-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  and make sure that they get the strongest start possible to try and get the best access<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:46:50</a>:</strong>  rate from the beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:50">0:46:50-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  But I also know, especially within the permaculture community, those who just scatter seeds out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:46:55">0:46:55-0:47:03</a>:</strong>  in the area or plant a ton very, very close together and really neglect them intentionally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:03">0:47:03-0:47:08</a>:</strong>  in order to ensure that only the hardiest ones survive and that they continue to propagate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:08">0:47:08-0:47:15</a>:</strong>  from those sort of hardier genetics from the ones that are able to last without that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:15">0:47:15-0:47:17</a>:</strong>  So they don't give them any special potting mix.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:17">0:47:17-0:47:20</a>:</strong>  Perhaps they use the exact same soil as you would find on site.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:20">0:47:20-0:47:26</a>:</strong>  Have you tried one or either of those methods and found some success or some advice?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:26">0:47:26-0:47:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:27">0:47:27-0:47:31</a>:</strong>  I mean, that system works very well as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:31">0:47:31-0:47:34</a>:</strong>  You just have to have more seeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:34">0:47:34-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  So either or, just depending on what resources you have, perhaps?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:40</a>:</strong>  So it's good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:40">0:47:40-0:47:41</a>:</strong>  It works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:41">0:47:41-0:47:46</a>:</strong>  It's just slower and it's not as successful as to develop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:46">0:47:46-0:47:49</a>:</strong>  I mean, I like that personally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:49">0:47:49-0:47:54</a>:</strong>  It's just you need more time and more seeds than the other way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:47:54">0:47:54-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  I mean, where I'm at, if you were to do that on an area that's clear cut, weeds will grow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:11</a>:</strong>  so fast that you probably have a one in 50 seeds that you throw might survive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:11">0:48:11-0:48:14</a>:</strong>  So it's maybe even less.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:14">0:48:14-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  I mean, it's a very, I would say even less than that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:24</a>:</strong>  So if you have plenty of seeds in time, I think that would work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:24">0:48:24-0:48:29</a>:</strong>  I've done it in certain areas where I don't even go and scatter the seeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:29">0:48:29-0:48:34</a>:</strong>  I just leave the alpha tree and let the same … I spot alpha trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:34">0:48:34-0:48:35</a>:</strong>  I don't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:35">0:48:35-0:48:44</a>:</strong>  I leave those there and then let those just naturally drop their seed and have them be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:44">0:48:44-0:48:45</a>:</strong>  born naturally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:45">0:48:45-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  That's really what a natural forest does and that's really the ultimate way of doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:48:50</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:50">0:48:50-0:48:55</a>:</strong>  It's just a much slower process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:55">0:48:55-0:48:57</a>:</strong>  And it's not just like, oh, those are the toughest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:57">0:48:57-0:48:58</a>:</strong>  That's the best way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:48:58">0:48:58-0:49:03</a>:</strong>  I mean, you can implement that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:03">0:49:03-0:49:09</a>:</strong>  You choose … that's where you have to be better at selecting when you do the other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:09">0:49:09-0:49:10</a>:</strong>  process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:10">0:49:10-0:49:13</a>:</strong>  What I'm doing is you've got to find what is the right tree, which is the right tree<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:13">0:49:13-0:49:15</a>:</strong>  that's dropping seeds and it's developing the best trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:15">0:49:15-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  So that's the tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  There might be 10 of that same species in the area, but choose this tree because that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:22</a>:</strong>  tree is the one that works for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:22">0:49:22-0:49:26</a>:</strong>  That's the healthy one in the area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:26">0:49:26-0:49:29</a>:</strong>  Then you plant your seedlings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:29">0:49:29-0:49:31</a>:</strong>  You choose the best seed off of that tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:31">0:49:31-0:49:35</a>:</strong>  You might have thousands of seeds from that tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:35">0:49:35-0:49:42</a>:</strong>  You choose the 10 percent you're slowly eating as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:46</a>:</strong>  And then you plant them and then there's still only like an 80 percent success rate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:46">0:49:46-0:49:49</a>:</strong>  when they germinate, even less maybe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:49">0:49:49-0:49:53</a>:</strong>  And then you start selecting as well and then you go plant them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:53">0:49:53-0:49:59</a>:</strong>  And I've had very good success as … The problem is you need to make sure you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:49:59">0:49:59-0:50:04</a>:</strong>  collecting plenty of variety of seeds because it's very easy to just do one species that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:04">0:50:04-0:50:07</a>:</strong>  way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:07">0:50:07-0:50:11</a>:</strong>  So the other way, you just collect seeds, throw them all randomly and nature will do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:11">0:50:11-0:50:14</a>:</strong>  its course kind of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:14">0:50:14-0:50:19</a>:</strong>  Ultimately, I think that's the right way of going about things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:19">0:50:19-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  I think it's slower and it's not as successful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:29</a>:</strong>  It just depends on what your ultimate course is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:29">0:50:29-0:50:32</a>:</strong>  Are you trying to reforest really quick, really fast?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:32">0:50:32-0:50:37</a>:</strong>  Or are you just going about … What I've seen more in permaculture, I practice permaculture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:37">0:50:37-0:50:41</a>:</strong>  I practice many other types of organic agriculture systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:41">0:50:41-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  But permaculture, your yields tend to be much better for a family or for a community or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:50">0:50:50-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  for a set of families who are investing time into that permaculture system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:51:01</a>:</strong>  Unless you start applying other types of systems within your permaculture system like biointensive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:09</a>:</strong>  systems and certain types of land management systems, it's hard to get very consistent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:09">0:51:09-0:51:12</a>:</strong>  yields that you can then outsource to other businesses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:12">0:51:12-0:51:15</a>:</strong>  You might be able to do in a farmer's market the way I'm talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:15">0:51:15-0:51:18</a>:</strong>  But if you're trying to find other organisms, you need to really …<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:18">0:51:18-0:51:22</a>:</strong>  You have to dip in efficiency as you get more complex and more diverse.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:22">0:51:22-0:51:23</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:23">0:51:23-0:51:26</a>:</strong>  And therefore, same thing happens with reforestation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:26">0:51:26-0:51:34</a>:</strong>  If you have all the time in the world and if you are just doing it and it's easy and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:34">0:51:34-0:51:43</a>:</strong>  luckily, I am in an area where I have employees, we have people, we're an operating farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:43">0:51:43-0:51:47</a>:</strong>  It's more labor intensive but I feel like it's a much better success rate and it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:47">0:51:47-0:51:49</a>:</strong>  a much faster success rate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:49">0:51:49-0:51:55</a>:</strong>  And the way I'm doing it, I would pose as what you're saying, that works really well<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:51:55">0:51:55-0:52:03</a>:</strong>  but I think that would work slower and it's for someone who doesn't have the manpower<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:03">0:52:03-0:52:06</a>:</strong>  behind doing what I'm doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:06">0:52:06-0:52:08</a>:</strong>  It's easier to just grab seeds and go through them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:08">0:52:08-0:52:12</a>:</strong>  And even easier, the best way is just leaving nature do its course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:12">0:52:12-0:52:15</a>:</strong>  You leave your tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:15">0:52:15-0:52:17</a>:</strong>  When you're in a forest, you need some trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:17">0:52:17-0:52:19</a>:</strong>  You select the ones that are not so good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:19">0:52:19-0:52:21</a>:</strong>  You leave the best ones for seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:21">0:52:21-0:52:23</a>:</strong>  Those naturally drop their seeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:23">0:52:23-0:52:28</a>:</strong>  You're not even doing the work and then those reproduce slowly like nature would.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:28">0:52:28-0:52:30</a>:</strong>  That's really the ultimate goal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:30">0:52:30-0:52:31</a>:</strong>  Ideally, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:31">0:52:31-0:52:38</a>:</strong>  To have nature do the work for you instead of you throwing out the seeds and you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:38">0:52:38-0:52:40</a>:</strong>  doing nature's work throwing the seeds where you want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:40">0:52:40-0:52:45</a>:</strong>  If you can get the trees in your area to drop seeds and birds take them there and nature<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:45">0:52:45-0:52:47</a>:</strong>  flies them out there and that's what's being born.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:47">0:52:47-0:52:51</a>:</strong>  But ultimately nature's telling these are the best plants to be grown here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:51">0:52:51-0:52:53</a>:</strong>  But like I said, it's much slower.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:53">0:52:53-0:52:57</a>:</strong>  It's not as successful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:52:57">0:52:57-0:53:02</a>:</strong>  It's going to take a lot longer to cover land that way, I think, that is going to be available<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:02">0:53:02-0:53:05</a>:</strong>  for a yield sooner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:05">0:53:05-0:53:10</a>:</strong>  So if you do that, I'm not going to be able to put tourism into that until 20, 30 years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:10">0:53:10-0:53:11</a>:</strong>  from now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:11">0:53:11-0:53:16</a>:</strong>  It's going to take a while to put something in there that they can really see the difference<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:16">0:53:16-0:53:20</a>:</strong>  between weeds and trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:20">0:53:20-0:53:24</a>:</strong>  And it also does depend on your ecosystem because one of the projects that I went to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:24">0:53:24-0:53:30</a>:</strong>  go profile and is going to be one of the interviews that I put into this series on reforestation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:30">0:53:30-0:53:34</a>:</strong>  They're in a cloud forest environment in Veracruz, Mexico.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:34">0:53:34-0:53:40</a>:</strong>  And they bought a pasture land that of course was part of the cloud forest originally was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:40">0:53:40-0:53:45</a>:</strong>  completely clear cut and left to pasture cattle for a long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:45">0:53:45-0:53:48</a>:</strong>  And as soon as they bought it, they took all the cattle off and allowed it to regenerate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:48">0:53:48-0:53:49</a>:</strong>  on its own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:49">0:53:49-0:53:54</a>:</strong>  And within 15 years, it's become a forest completely without any maintenance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:54">0:53:54-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  Now that's not going to happen everywhere in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:54:01</a>:</strong>  That's a very unique ecosystem that wants to be under forest so desperately has the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:01">0:54:01-0:54:05</a>:</strong>  water resources and everything to allow for that to happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:05">0:54:05-0:54:11</a>:</strong>  But there are some circumstances where I have seen where leaving it fallow is actually one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:11">0:54:11-0:54:13</a>:</strong>  of the most accelerating ways to regenerate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:13">0:54:13-0:54:16</a>:</strong>  But it does require very unique circumstances.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:16">0:54:16-0:54:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I guess it depends on the type of weeds that are growing in that area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:23">0:54:23-0:54:32</a>:</strong>  Here where we're at, there's a lot of choker weeds, weeds that like are parasitic weeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:32">0:54:32-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  And therefore here, if something is, they'll just start crawling all over it and choking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:40</a>:</strong>  it to death and letting it not letting it grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:40">0:54:40-0:54:45</a>:</strong>  So you got to make sure, you know, doesn't mean it's just a success rate would be a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:45">0:54:45-0:54:46</a>:</strong>  and it works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:46">0:54:46-0:54:47</a>:</strong>  It's just a lot slower.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:47">0:54:47-0:54:52</a>:</strong>  I think I can have a forest doing the way I'm doing and within five years, you'll have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:54:52">0:54:52-0:55:00</a>:</strong>  something that are, you know, 20, 25 feet tall trees within five, six years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:00">0:55:00-0:55:07</a>:</strong>  So it's half the time at 15 years and being that area being the right perfect space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:07">0:55:07-0:55:16</a>:</strong>  So I think it just depends on the area, what you're planning to do with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:16">0:55:16-0:55:19</a>:</strong>  I'm very fond of just leaving nature do its thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:19">0:55:19-0:55:24</a>:</strong>  I have areas within my farm where I'm just not touching and I'm just, you know, I'm playing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:24">0:55:24-0:55:26</a>:</strong>  around with it and I'm just letting it go wild.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:26">0:55:26-0:55:33</a>:</strong>  And you know, right now there's all these, it's just all, the weeds where I'm at, they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:33">0:55:33-0:55:36</a>:</strong>  grow 20, 15 feet tall, the weeds where I'm at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:36">0:55:36-0:55:41</a>:</strong>  And so they're huge, you know, these weeds and then eventually they start dying out and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:41">0:55:41-0:55:45</a>:</strong>  they weeds could cover weeds and then that's when the trees start evolving.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:45">0:55:45-0:55:49</a>:</strong>  So the successive models of the forest naturally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:49">0:55:49-0:55:50</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:50">0:55:50-0:55:54</a>:</strong>  It takes two to three years before even a tree might sprout and then it takes, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:54">0:55:54-0:55:56</a>:</strong>  it just, it's, it's, it's, and it works great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:55:56">0:55:56-0:56:01</a>:</strong>  It's just the areas they just, if they're very isolated and they're very hard to plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:01">0:56:01-0:56:04</a>:</strong>  trees on them, those are probably the best areas to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:04">0:56:04-0:56:08</a>:</strong>  If it's something that's within, you know, your, your, if you're trying to plant trees<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:08">0:56:08-0:56:13</a>:</strong>  within the third and fourth area of your permaculture project, let's say, I would say those are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:13">0:56:13-0:56:18</a>:</strong>  actually easier to do what I'm doing and your fifth and if you, if you have a sixth area,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:18">0:56:18-0:56:22</a>:</strong>  let's say, well maybe those are the areas you just want to let nature do its course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:22">0:56:22-0:56:23</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:23">0:56:23-0:56:27</a>:</strong>  You know, they're just too far out there getting the trees out there, moving out to those areas,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:27">0:56:27-0:56:30</a>:</strong>  trying to take care of that, that situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:30">0:56:30-0:56:31</a>:</strong>  It's very labor intensive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:31">0:56:31-0:56:33</a>:</strong>  It's too, it's, it's, it's complicated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:33">0:56:33-0:56:34</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:34">0:56:34-0:56:37</a>:</strong>  I love that you start talking about the broad acreage that you're working on when you start<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:37">0:56:37-0:56:38</a>:</strong>  getting into the...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:38">0:56:38-0:56:39</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:39">0:56:39-0:56:43</a>:</strong>  So there's a lot of areas in my farm where I'm just, they're just very hard access and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:43">0:56:43-0:56:46</a>:</strong>  those I'm just leaving them go wild and those are the areas, anything that's very close<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:46">0:56:46-0:56:54</a>:</strong>  or I want to see them to be walking through where I did, there, it's a very nice view<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:54">0:56:54-0:56:56</a>:</strong>  and those are the areas I'm more planting quick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:56">0:56:56-0:56:59</a>:</strong>  I want that to really come out as fast as possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:56:59">0:56:59-0:57:04</a>:</strong>  And then after three years, four years, my trees are, like I said, my trees within three<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:04">0:57:04-0:57:08</a>:</strong>  to four years, I planted some trees two years ago, they're already 10 feet tall, two years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:08">0:57:08-0:57:09</a>:</strong>  ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:09">0:57:09-0:57:12</a>:</strong>  Not all of them, but some of them are 10 feet tall, two years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:12">0:57:12-0:57:14</a>:</strong>  So one year of making the tree, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:14">0:57:14-0:57:15</a>:</strong>  One make of making the tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:15">0:57:15-0:57:19</a>:</strong>  So the tree, when I put it on the ground, it's about two feet tall, one, you know, by<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:19">0:57:19-0:57:22</a>:</strong>  the time, then two years later, it's, it's, it's over 10 feet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:22">0:57:22-0:57:25</a>:</strong>  It's already starting to look nice within three years, within two years since I put<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:25">0:57:25-0:57:26</a>:</strong>  it on the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:26">0:57:26-0:57:29</a>:</strong>  It's already, it's, it, it looks, it looks like there's something there and then I might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:29">0:57:29-0:57:32</a>:</strong>  just take care of it for another year or so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:32">0:57:32-0:57:37</a>:</strong>  And then I just let natural weeds grow, but the trees alone are going to create shade<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:37">0:57:37-0:57:40</a>:</strong>  and then, so they're not going to let all the bottom grow too crazy anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:40">0:57:40-0:57:41</a>:</strong>  They're going to control it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:41">0:57:41-0:57:42</a>:</strong>  They're going to be dropping their leaves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:42">0:57:42-0:57:46</a>:</strong>  They're going to start developing mulch a lot faster too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:46">0:57:46-0:57:49</a>:</strong>  I use mulch from my forest as fertilizer as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:49">0:57:49-0:57:54</a>:</strong>  So if I depend on that mulch, how fast can I get that mulch production going?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:57:54">0:57:54-0:58:01</a>:</strong>  I use a tree mulch forest, which then I compost with animal products and, and, and all sorts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:01">0:58:01-0:58:03</a>:</strong>  of stuff, whatever I can get my access to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:03">0:58:03-0:58:09</a>:</strong>  And that's a very important part of my fertilization is using a tree, tree scraps from below.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:09">0:58:09-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  Basically how soon can I produce that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:12">0:58:12-0:58:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:13">0:58:13-0:58:17</a>:</strong>  How soon can you start to get the yield from the forest products like that so that it starts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:17">0:58:17-0:58:19</a>:</strong>  to maintain itself is what you're getting at?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:19">0:58:19-0:58:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:20">0:58:20-0:58:21</a>:</strong>  It's like a by-product.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:21">0:58:21-0:58:27</a>:</strong>  And then I use that to compost, you know, with my animal manures and stuff and, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:27">0:58:27-0:58:32</a>:</strong>  I can create fertilizer for the, for the, for the veggies, for the avocados, for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:32">0:58:32-0:58:34</a>:</strong>  fruit trees, for stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:34">0:58:34-0:58:38</a>:</strong>  So I mean, there's another, another thing behind that as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:38">0:58:38-0:58:43</a>:</strong>  So, but like your trees that I planted three years ago, you know, I don't have to take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:43">0:58:43-0:58:45</a>:</strong>  care of that area anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:45">0:58:45-0:58:51</a>:</strong>  But you know, if I would have left it without doing this, like you're saying, trees would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:51">0:58:51-0:58:54</a>:</strong>  just be starting to sprout right now after a year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:54">0:58:54-0:58:55</a>:</strong>  Gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:55">0:58:55-0:58:57</a>:</strong>  And yeah, that's good to know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:58:57">0:58:57-0:59:01</a>:</strong>  It's those types of practical answers that I love getting from people who are boots on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:01">0:59:01-0:59:07</a>:</strong>  the ground, really doing this stuff themselves because in different cases and with different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:07">0:59:07-0:59:14</a>:</strong>  criteria or different goals, different approaches work or fail depending on, like you said,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:14">0:59:14-0:59:19</a>:</strong>  the amount of people that you have able to work on this and the goals of the project<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:19">0:59:19-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  itself, it changes the context and it's very good to hear what you found through your own<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:25">0:59:25-0:59:26</a>:</strong>  practical experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:26">0:59:26-0:59:31</a>:</strong>  Now with that in mind, can you tell our listeners how they can either get in touch with you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-alex-kronick/#t=0:59:31">0:59:31-0:59:37</a>:</strong>  to learn more or find out more about the projects in general and get in touch?<br />
