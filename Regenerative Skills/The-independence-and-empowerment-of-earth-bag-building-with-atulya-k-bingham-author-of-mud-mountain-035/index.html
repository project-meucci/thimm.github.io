<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:05">0:03:05-0:03:07</a>:</strong>  It's stunning, absolutely stunning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:07">0:03:07-0:03:10</a>:</strong>  Oh, man, that's one of the parts of that country I haven't seen before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:10">0:03:10-0:03:11</a>:</strong>  I'm very jealous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:11">0:03:11-0:03:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's amazing, really mesmerizing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:13">0:03:13-0:03:14</a>:</strong>  Fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:14">0:03:14-0:03:19</a>:</strong>  Well, we're going to get into some of your travels later in the questions, but how about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:19">0:03:19-0:03:25</a>:</strong>  we start out by telling us a bit about your background and how you first found out about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:25">0:03:25-0:03:28</a>:</strong>  natural building and earthbag construction?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:28">0:03:28-0:03:33</a>:</strong>  Right, well, I had no building experience at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:33">0:03:33-0:03:35</a>:</strong>  I thought I had no interest in building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:35">0:03:35-0:03:40</a>:</strong>  I was a teacher and I'd been living in Turkey for about, well, back then it must have been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:40">0:03:40-0:03:45</a>:</strong>  about 15 years I'd been there, maybe a bit less.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:45">0:03:45-0:03:50</a>:</strong>  And the reason I started was because I ran out of money, completely ran out of money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:50">0:03:50-0:03:57</a>:</strong>  I bankrupted myself after a couple of very poor business moves and I had no money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:03:57">0:03:57-0:04:04</a>:</strong>  And all I had left that wasn't collateral for a debt in some way was a piece of land<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:10</a>:</strong>  in southern Turkey, beautiful plot of land, but small, only a couple of acres.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:10">0:04:10-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  And so I moved up there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:12">0:04:12-0:04:15</a>:</strong>  It was May, so it was coming into summer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:15">0:04:15-0:04:19</a>:</strong>  And I moved up there in a tent just because I was exhausted, I was burned out and I couldn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:19">0:04:19-0:04:21</a>:</strong>  think what else to do, actually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:21">0:04:21-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  And so I was there in a tent in a field with no power and no running water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:30">0:04:30-0:04:37</a>:</strong>  And within a couple of weeks, I just began to transform and I started making little things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:37">0:04:37-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  as you have to, to survive, camp-style things, making myself a little bathroom and then a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:04:48</a>:</strong>  little kitchen and a little shade for the tent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:48">0:04:48-0:04:57</a>:</strong>  And slowly but surely I became fascinated by building and I realized I loved it and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:04:57">0:04:57-0:05:01</a>:</strong>  I'd just never really been introduced to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:01">0:05:01-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  That's why I thought I didn't like it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:10</a>:</strong>  And it went from there and I stayed up there for eight months in this tent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:10">0:05:10-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  And by this stage I'd become a wild woman.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:20</a>:</strong>  I was in love with the place and I loved the scorpions and I loved everything about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:20">0:05:20-0:05:25</a>:</strong>  And so I thought I was sure I was never going to live in a house again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:25">0:05:25-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  I said walls are for losers, I don't need them, I love my canvas, this is my life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:43</a>:</strong>  And then winter arrived as it does and a storm arrived and nearly blew me off the hill basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:43">0:05:43-0:05:47</a>:</strong>  because the storms there in winter are pretty big.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:47">0:05:47-0:05:53</a>:</strong>  I'm not quite as bad as you have been having over there but nonetheless it was a pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:53">0:05:53-0:05:54</a>:</strong>  big storm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:05:54">0:05:54-0:06:00</a>:</strong>  And so I realized the tent just kind of leaked everywhere and I was left huddled in the tent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:00">0:06:00-0:06:05</a>:</strong>  with my belongings and I thought I have to have a house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:05">0:06:05-0:06:09</a>:</strong>  And why did I choose earthbag?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:09">0:06:09-0:06:15</a>:</strong>  Well I'd seen a friend of mine had built these little earthbag structures and that was the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:15">0:06:15-0:06:18</a>:</strong>  first person who'd ever done it in Turkey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:18">0:06:18-0:06:22</a>:</strong>  And I'd seen them and I'd been talking to him sort of about three or four months ago<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:22">0:06:22-0:06:28</a>:</strong>  about these structures and he'd said oh it's so easy, anyone can do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:28">0:06:28-0:06:34</a>:</strong>  And I decided that I wanted a roundhouse and I could see from my land that I had a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:34">0:06:34-0:06:38</a>:</strong>  of decent earth, I could see that, that was clear, I already knew that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:38">0:06:38-0:06:42</a>:</strong>  So it made sense to make something from mud.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:42">0:06:42-0:06:43</a>:</strong>  And so I gave it a go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:43">0:06:43-0:06:49</a>:</strong>  So hang on one second, what do you mean by decent earth, what are you talking about there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:49">0:06:49-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah you need, for earthbag building you need about 25, 20, 25% clay content is optimum<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:00</a>:</strong>  really and that's exactly what it was, it was sort of 20% clay content.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:00">0:07:00-0:07:01</a>:</strong>  So when you've got that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:01">0:07:01-0:07:03</a>:</strong>  I see a ready mix batch, that's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:03">0:07:03-0:07:07</a>:</strong>  Yes it was incredible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:07">0:07:07-0:07:13</a>:</strong>  And so all I needed to do was use that earth in the bags and when you wet, you put the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:13">0:07:13-0:07:19</a>:</strong>  earth in damp and then when you tamp it down it forms a solid sort of clay earth brick<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:19">0:07:19-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  that when it dries becomes just like concrete really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:23">0:07:23-0:07:27</a>:</strong>  Fantastic, now I know you've written extensively about all of this in your book Mudball and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:27">0:07:27-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  in your blog as well, but could you tell our listeners about the steps that you took to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:35</a>:</strong>  start to build your own earthbag house?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:35">0:07:35-0:07:42</a>:</strong>  Yes well first of all I called my gardening help man, Jalal, who was my right hand man<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:42">0:07:42-0:07:47</a>:</strong>  in all things garden and construction because I still didn't, I really didn't know anything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:47">0:07:47-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  to be honest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:07:53</a>:</strong>  I mean really I hadn't even put a shelf up when I moved on that land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:53">0:07:53-0:07:59</a>:</strong>  That's the state of greenness that I was about building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:07:59">0:07:59-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  So he came and I said Jalal we're going to make a house and he said yeah we told you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:11</a>:</strong>  you should make a house months ago and I said yeah we need to get moving and he said you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:11">0:08:11-0:08:12</a>:</strong>  right, winter's here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:12">0:08:12-0:08:13</a>:</strong>  What are we going to do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:13">0:08:13-0:08:16</a>:</strong>  He said make a hut, I know how to make huts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:16">0:08:16-0:08:22</a>:</strong>  I said well actually I want an earthbag house and he just looked at me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:22">0:08:22-0:08:25</a>:</strong>  He's like what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:25">0:08:25-0:08:30</a>:</strong>  And I told him what to do and I showed him how we were going to do it and so we started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:30">0:08:30-0:08:37</a>:</strong>  by measuring, well we started by drawing a circle on the ground as to how big we wanted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:37">0:08:37-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  the house, digging about a half metre trench for the foundations and filling that with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:54</a>:</strong>  rubble and stones and then I got the bags shipped in from Istanbul and it's incredibly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:54">0:08:54-0:08:59</a>:</strong>  inexpensive because I really had no money, I mean very little money to do this with but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:08:59">0:08:59-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  I still managed because it's such a cheap method to use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:06</a>:</strong>  All you need is the earth and the bags and some barbed wire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:06">0:09:06-0:09:10</a>:</strong>  That's sort of, I mean you obviously need wood for your door frames as well and for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:10">0:09:10-0:09:11</a>:</strong>  your roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:11">0:09:11-0:09:15</a>:</strong>  It's a very, very expensive bit but you can get a house up very, very cheaply with this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:15">0:09:15-0:09:20</a>:</strong>  method so we got the bags in and then we started laying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:20">0:09:20-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  The first two layers we made a stem wall with gravel filled bags which was excellent because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:32</a>:</strong>  although it's a very dry climate in the summer, in winter it floods a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:32">0:09:32-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  There's huge rainfalls that happen and that gravel foundation, the rubble trench foundation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:44</a>:</strong>  with the gravel stem wall worked a treat, it really did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:44">0:09:44-0:09:53</a>:</strong>  My floor was bone dry all the time and then after that we filled the bags up with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:53">0:09:53-0:09:57</a>:</strong>  earth mix, the clay earth which was just the earth mix.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:57">0:09:57-0:09:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah, can you talk about that a little bit?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:09:59">0:09:59-0:10:04</a>:</strong>  So for those who are unfamiliar with earth bag construction, what sort of bags did you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:04">0:10:04-0:10:05</a>:</strong>  use?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:05">0:10:05-0:10:07</a>:</strong>  What are the bags filled with and how did those walls start to go up?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:07">0:10:07-0:10:13</a>:</strong>  Right, well there's two kinds of bags that you can use and the most natural method would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:13">0:10:13-0:10:18</a>:</strong>  be to use burlap bags for sure and I used polypropylene bags for two reasons.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:18">0:10:18-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  A, I couldn't find decent burlap bags in Turkey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:29</a>:</strong>  B, if you're in a damp climate with earthquakes which is what I was in, the bags can rot,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:29">0:10:29-0:10:33</a>:</strong>  burlap can rot so I needed to be sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:33">0:10:33-0:10:39</a>:</strong>  I mean I've sat even in that house through four earthquakes and when you're in an earthquake<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:39">0:10:39-0:10:43</a>:</strong>  zone like Turkey you want to know that your house is not going to fall on you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:45</a>:</strong>  So that was always in the back of my mind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:45">0:10:45-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  So I used the polypropylene bags and then you asked about how, what was the next question?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:54</a>:</strong>  Sorry, about how the wall went up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:10:54">0:10:54-0:11:00</a>:</strong>  Exactly, how do you start stacking them and what sort of keeps the layers together?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:00">0:11:00-0:11:07</a>:</strong>  Right, so there's a method, you sort of fill the bags up a little way and then you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:07">0:11:07-0:11:12</a>:</strong>  to kind of crush the earth down in them so they get a nice square bottom and then you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:12">0:11:12-0:11:17</a>:</strong>  fill the rest of the sack up and then you fold the sack up just like a parcel and lay<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:17">0:11:17-0:11:23</a>:</strong>  it on the ground and you go round like that in a circle so they're all squashed in and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:23">0:11:23-0:11:29</a>:</strong>  once the circle's complete you get a heavy block of wood or whatever, something flat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:29">0:11:29-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  and smooth and heavy and you go round and tamp, it's called tamping, tamp all the bags<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:35">0:11:35-0:11:43</a>:</strong>  and that squashes the earth flat and creates this solid clay earth brick and then on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:43">0:11:43-0:11:53</a>:</strong>  top of that you will run two layers, two rows of thick industrial strength barbed wire and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:53">0:11:53-0:11:58</a>:</strong>  that's what's holding all the bags together, that's what's holding the layers together<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:11:58">0:11:58-0:12:02</a>:</strong>  and that's the tensile strength of the building, that's what stops it falling apart in an earthquake.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:02">0:12:02-0:12:07</a>:</strong>  Oh, marvelous, okay so that's your bond in between where perhaps with Adobe they would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:07">0:12:07-0:12:13</a>:</strong>  use mortar, it's the wire that's giving the friction needed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:13">0:12:13-0:12:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah and that is why, I love Adobe, I'm certainly not knocking Adobe or Cobb actually but that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:21">0:12:21-0:12:27</a>:</strong>  the difference, that's why Earthbag outperforms every other building method for earthquakes,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:27">0:12:27-0:12:28</a>:</strong>  that's why.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:28">0:12:28-0:12:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, it's broken or nearly broken the shape tables, they have to stop using the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:36">0:12:36-0:12:39</a>:</strong>  shape tables because the structure is just holding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:39">0:12:39-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  You're kidding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:42">0:12:42-0:12:48</a>:</strong>  Now, I know you mentioned that you filled the bottom layers of the bags with gravel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:48">0:12:48-0:12:52</a>:</strong>  and used that as your foundation, do you know of all the types of foundations that are available<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:52">0:12:52-0:12:54</a>:</strong>  for Earthbag housers?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:54">0:12:54-0:12:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah, you can, I mean the rubble trench, I always really recommend the rubble trench<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:12:59">0:12:59-0:13:07</a>:</strong>  foundation no matter where you are, it's an excellent, it's the sort of basic original<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:07">0:13:07-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  foundation method that we always used to use and it's perfect for wet climates, it just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  does the job but if you mean the stem wall, you could fill like the bags with other things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:28</a>:</strong>  such as, for example, limecrete would be a great example and another very good, well-performing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:28">0:13:28-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  material in the damp and I don't personally recommend concrete at all, people do do it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:38</a>:</strong>  with concrete and I've been in Earthbag houses with concrete foundations and they're always<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:38">0:13:38-0:13:42</a>:</strong>  damp because concrete holds the wet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:42">0:13:42-0:13:50</a>:</strong>  This is natural building, earth-based building and mainstream construction with concrete<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:50">0:13:50-0:13:58</a>:</strong>  and iron are two separate methods and the materials don't go together, it's quite difficult<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:13:58">0:13:58-0:14:03</a>:</strong>  to get this home to people sometimes, you know, concrete doesn't really mix very well<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:03">0:14:03-0:14:08</a>:</strong>  with earth because it holds the damp and then of course all that damp wicks up into your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:08">0:14:08-0:14:09</a>:</strong>  wall which you don't want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:09">0:14:09-0:14:15</a>:</strong>  So, limecrete on the other hand gets rid of water very, very fast, that's what it does,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:15">0:14:15-0:14:21</a>:</strong>  it just sucks up all of, sorry, it doesn't suck up, it gets rid of the water so it just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:21">0:14:21-0:14:24</a>:</strong>  keeps it dry the whole time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:24">0:14:24-0:14:27</a>:</strong>  Through the porousness of the material?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:27">0:14:27-0:14:31</a>:</strong>  Because it's breathing, yes that's right, because it's breathing whereas Portland cement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:31">0:14:31-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  isn't exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  So talk a little bit about how you've experimented with limecrete, some of the different additives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:42</a>:</strong>  and such that give it stronger properties and if you could also explain what limecrete<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:42">0:14:42-0:14:46</a>:</strong>  is and how you've used it in your own building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:46">0:14:46-0:14:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah, limecrete is so easy to use, I'm actually sort of baffled as to why people aren't using<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:52">0:14:52-0:14:57</a>:</strong>  it more, I think it's just because they don't know anymore, it's very, very easy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:14:57">0:14:57-0:15:01</a>:</strong>  There are many, it's very complicated to get into all the different kinds of lime but basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:01">0:15:01-0:15:10</a>:</strong>  you want a non-hydraulic or a kind of lime, you can get it in bags or you can get it in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:10">0:15:10-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  a putty and the putty is better for plasters and the bagged type lime is often better for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:23</a>:</strong>  things like limecrete but that's, there's a whole topic about that so I'm not going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:23">0:15:23-0:15:25</a>:</strong>  to go into that, people have written books on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:25">0:15:25-0:15:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I teach that in my courses, perhaps I'll do a podcast sometime about the whole<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:28">0:15:28-0:15:30</a>:</strong>  lime cycle, it's pretty good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:30">0:15:30-0:15:34</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's quite complicated all the different types there are but anyway, you're going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:34">0:15:34-0:15:40</a>:</strong>  to mix your lime with sand, that will give you a lime plaster and if you need a pozzolan,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:40">0:15:40-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  something like a burnt substance such as ash, brick dust, something which has been burned,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:53</a>:</strong>  you can even buy pozzolans from construction suppliers and mix it into your lime, with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:15:53">0:15:53-0:16:00</a>:</strong>  your lime and your sand and that pozzolan creates a reaction which makes the lime, limecrete<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:00">0:16:00-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  set really, really hard so yeah, that's how you make limecrete and how have I used<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:06</a>:</strong>  it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:06">0:16:06-0:16:11</a>:</strong>  Well, I use, I came to the limecrete thing because I was, I was using mud for everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:11">0:16:11-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  and I used it as a mortar in my stone walls as well so I was using my mud plaster everywhere<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:23</a>:</strong>  but there were certain areas where it was failing, one of them was my back step, another<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:23">0:16:23-0:16:27</a>:</strong>  one was the sink because these areas were getting wet and they were getting a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:27">0:16:27-0:16:32</a>:</strong>  hardware and I needed something else so I started experimenting with limecrete and it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:32">0:16:32-0:16:36</a>:</strong>  was brilliant, it was, I was just banging my head as to why I hadn't done this earlier<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:36">0:16:36-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  because it's so easy, I just used ash from my stove with sand and lime, mixed it all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:49</a>:</strong>  up and it was great, you can add other things as I said like brick dust, marble dust, also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:49">0:16:49-0:16:51</a>:</strong>  create really nice results with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:51">0:16:51-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  Fantastic, now let's flip it a little bit and here's, if you could tell me a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:17:01</a>:</strong>  bit about what some of the drawbacks or difficulties when building with earthbags are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:01">0:17:01-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah, the difficult part about earthbag building is that it's very labour intensive, you want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:18</a>:</strong>  a motivated team and you need, we did it actually with four or five people, my own house and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:18">0:17:18-0:17:25</a>:</strong>  it took about six weeks which isn't too bad but we were only really working three or four<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:25">0:17:25-0:17:30</a>:</strong>  days a week because that's all we could manage because we're getting tired but it is tiring,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:30">0:17:30-0:17:38</a>:</strong>  it requires quite a lot of lifting of earth so it is quite labour intensive, I'd say that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:42</a>:</strong>  a major drawback, I can't really think of another one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:42">0:17:42-0:17:47</a>:</strong>  Fair enough, now I know that one of the things that confounds people the most when it comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:47">0:17:47-0:17:52</a>:</strong>  to earthen building is how to integrate windows, doors, shelves and sometimes even attach the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:52">0:17:52-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  roof securely, how have you had success integrating these features into your own house?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah well, with earthbag you have to anchor it in and it's actually quite simple once<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:06">0:18:06-0:18:12</a>:</strong>  you've got the basic concept behind it, you can do it with everything, everything has<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:12">0:18:12-0:18:19</a>:</strong>  to be anchored into the wall and so it pays to plan which I'm not very good at but anyway<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:19">0:18:19-0:18:25</a>:</strong>  it plays to plan before you start because you're going to need to know where everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:25">0:18:25-0:18:27</a>:</strong>  is going to go on the wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:27">0:18:27-0:18:28</a>:</strong>  What do I mean by anchoring?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:28">0:18:28-0:18:35</a>:</strong>  Well, you need to have, usually use pieces of wood which you would slot between the layers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:35">0:18:35-0:18:40</a>:</strong>  of earthbag and they would have barbed wire going nailed onto them so that the earthbag<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:40">0:18:40-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  is squashed onto them and those pieces of wood act as anchors that later on you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:18:56</a>:</strong>  bang window frames into or door frames into and the same goes for the roof, you lay wooden<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:18:56">0:18:56-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  anchors all over the roof and then nail those anchors into the bags and barbed wire them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:10</a>:</strong>  and then you can have something to bang your roof into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:10">0:19:10-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  It's a bit difficult to explain without seeing it, I must admit it needs an example or a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:15</a>:</strong>  photograph.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:15">0:19:15-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah, no certainly and I go over this a lot in the courses that I teach too, doing dead<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:24</a>:</strong>  men and different ways of anchoring things into dissimilar materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:24">0:19:24-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  It's a bit of a challenge if you haven't done it before and diagrams certainly help but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:31</a>:</strong>  I think you did explain that quite well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:31">0:19:31-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  Now I know that you've also incorporated a lot of off-grid features into your building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  mostly out of necessity like you were talking about in the beginning, you didn't have access<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:41</a>:</strong>  to running water and electricity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:41">0:19:41-0:19:46</a>:</strong>  Could you go over some of the success and challenges with things like composting toilets,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:46">0:19:46-0:19:51</a>:</strong>  lighting, water and access to other amenities as well as anything else that you'd like to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:51">0:19:51-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  address during your time living out there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:58</a>:</strong>  Yes, composting toilet was brilliant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:19:58">0:19:58-0:20:01</a>:</strong>  It's so easy to make.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:01">0:20:01-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  I even have one in my van now, I'm travelling now in a van, I've even made one in the van.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:08</a>:</strong>  They're so easy to use, so easy to make.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:08">0:20:08-0:20:11</a>:</strong>  So composting toilet I'm a fan of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:11">0:20:11-0:20:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I've been converted, never go back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:15">0:20:15-0:20:20</a>:</strong>  Lighting I found also, solar power is also very easy to use, great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:20">0:20:20-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  The only troubles with solar power is when you're, I mean I was a very tiny off-grid<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:30</a>:</strong>  system and I didn't have many appliances and I wasn't really bothered about it because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:30">0:20:30-0:20:33</a>:</strong>  I'm alone and it didn't make any difference to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:33">0:20:33-0:20:38</a>:</strong>  If you had a big family and you needed huge fridges and washing machines and you want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:38">0:20:38-0:20:46</a>:</strong>  all those modern things, then conveniences, then you need obviously a much more elaborate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:46">0:20:46-0:20:47</a>:</strong>  expensive system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:47">0:20:47-0:20:51</a>:</strong>  But I was very pleased with my solar power system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:51">0:20:51-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  I only had two panels and two batteries and that was it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:20:57</a>:</strong>  That was kind of enough for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:20:57">0:20:57-0:21:01</a>:</strong>  Can you give us an idea of what you were running off of that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:01">0:21:01-0:21:02</a>:</strong>  Yeah, not very much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:02">0:21:02-0:21:07</a>:</strong>  Computers, lights, the small stuff, all the small stuff plus the only big thing I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:07">0:21:07-0:21:13</a>:</strong>  running was a little fridge but it wasn't running particularly well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:13">0:21:13-0:21:19</a>:</strong>  Although that's because I was in Turkey and I couldn't get hold of, now I'm sort of in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:19">0:21:19-0:21:23</a>:</strong>  Europe at the moment, you can get amazing sort of fridges that you can run off solar<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:23">0:21:23-0:21:28</a>:</strong>  that work really well but mine wasn't a solar fridge so to speak.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:28">0:21:28-0:21:31</a>:</strong>  So it was using far more power than it should have done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:31">0:21:31-0:21:37</a>:</strong>  So did you even have to convert your 12 volt DC to AC power to run any of those?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:37">0:21:37-0:21:44</a>:</strong>  I was running, yeah, I had an inverter that was changing the 12 volts to 240 volts and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:44">0:21:44-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  yeah, that's pretty much, except for the lights, the lights were running off the 12 volt system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:55</a>:</strong>  direct from the battery but everything else was running through the inverter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:55">0:21:55-0:21:58</a>:</strong>  Sure, how about water?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:21:58">0:21:58-0:22:04</a>:</strong>  Water was the nightmare and that's the thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:04">0:22:04-0:22:10</a>:</strong>  In the end I connected, after two years I connected, it was cheaper to connect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:10">0:22:10-0:22:13</a>:</strong>  That was the reality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:13">0:22:13-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  Because we had five months of the year with no rain so I was collecting rainwater from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:25</a>:</strong>  the roofs and for three months it would sort of rush down a stream and I tried to collect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:25">0:22:25-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  all that water into pools but it was okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:31">0:22:31-0:22:36</a>:</strong>  I had just about enough for my own personal use but trying to grow things you need a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:36">0:22:36-0:22:39</a>:</strong>  of water and when you know you have five months of the year you're not going to get a single<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:39">0:22:39-0:22:42</a>:</strong>  drop of rain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:42">0:22:42-0:22:48</a>:</strong>  And then you get a puncture for example in your pool or it leaves a tap on or it was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:48">0:22:48-0:22:53</a>:</strong>  a big headache.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:53">0:22:53-0:22:57</a>:</strong>  So that I found incredibly difficult and that's what this time, because now that's what I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:22:57">0:22:57-0:23:02</a>:</strong>  doing looking for a new piece of land, that's the key thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:02">0:23:02-0:23:05</a>:</strong>  Water, nothing else matters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:05">0:23:05-0:23:09</a>:</strong>  The power thing is not, I mean there's so many options for power you could have wind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:09">0:23:09-0:23:15</a>:</strong>  I know people with wind power systems as well, it's very easy to generate power but water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:19</a>:</strong>  you can't generate it, you need it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:19">0:23:19-0:23:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:21">0:23:21-0:23:26</a>:</strong>  Were there any other amenities that you managed to sort of make for yourself or have substitutes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:26">0:23:26-0:23:31</a>:</strong>  for while you were living there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:31">0:23:31-0:23:41</a>:</strong>  Well, I made, because the fridge wasn't working very well, in the end I found it was better<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:41">0:23:41-0:23:48</a>:</strong>  to use the old clay, what they call a zieh pot fridge but that would only work in a very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:48">0:23:48-0:23:52</a>:</strong>  dry climate which I was sort of in except for the winter time and it didn't matter in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:52">0:23:52-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  the winter anyway because it was cold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:23:56</a>:</strong>  That worked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:56">0:23:56-0:23:57</a>:</strong>  Any other amenities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:57">0:23:57-0:23:59</a>:</strong>  I can't think of any now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:23:59">0:23:59-0:24:00</a>:</strong>  No.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:00">0:24:00-0:24:06</a>:</strong>  Well, the land cooling system, yes I suppose, I created a sort of little microclimate which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:06">0:24:06-0:24:11</a>:</strong>  I was quite proud of and it worked really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:11">0:24:11-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  Once I got connected, it wasn't very big, a small pool of water which was just in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:19">0:24:19-0:24:25</a>:</strong>  shade at one side of the land and I got the idea from Iran where I'd seen these wind chimneys<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:25">0:24:25-0:24:32</a>:</strong>  where they would suck in the air over a cold pool and they'd use that to air condition<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:32">0:24:32-0:24:33</a>:</strong>  the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:33">0:24:33-0:24:37</a>:</strong>  We sort of did the same thing with the land on a bigger scale and it worked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:37">0:24:37-0:24:45</a>:</strong>  It made a huge difference, just this little pool of water in the shade, got very cold<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:45">0:24:45-0:24:50</a>:</strong>  and then retained that coolness throughout the day and changed that climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:50">0:24:50-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  So yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:52</a>:</strong>  Fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:52">0:24:52-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah, a little bit of landscape engineering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:24:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:24:56">0:24:56-0:25:01</a>:</strong>  Now, I want to echo something that you touched on a little bit earlier in the conversation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:01">0:25:01-0:25:03</a>:</strong>  and that was the roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:03">0:25:03-0:25:07</a>:</strong>  You were saying that it was by far the most expensive part of the building and I know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:07">0:25:07-0:25:11</a>:</strong>  that's been true of a lot of other earthen buildings that I've worked on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:11">0:25:11-0:25:14</a>:</strong>  What sort of roof system did you take on as your first project?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:14">0:25:14-0:25:18</a>:</strong>  Because that's a lot more technical sometimes than just stacking earth bags.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:18">0:25:18-0:25:27</a>:</strong>  Yes, and that was the part where I didn't sleep for at least a week with that roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:27">0:25:27-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  And yes, you're absolutely right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:33</a>:</strong>  That's the technical part and that's the part where really you should be a carpenter because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:33">0:25:33-0:25:35</a>:</strong>  it's a roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:35">0:25:35-0:25:45</a>:</strong>  So I chose and I would advise anyone else to choose the same was an earthen roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:45">0:25:45-0:25:47</a>:</strong>  So it was a sloping roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:47">0:25:47-0:25:51</a>:</strong>  All I had was the joists running flat across the roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:51">0:25:51-0:25:56</a>:</strong>  So there was nothing particularly difficult about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:56">0:25:56-0:25:59</a>:</strong>  It wasn't like a reciprocal roof or anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:25:59">0:25:59-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  It was just joists running flat across the roof with about a 10 centimeter raise at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  front so that the rainwater could obviously drain off the roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  And I made an earth roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:17</a>:</strong>  It was actually, yeah, although I worried about it and I was panicked about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:17">0:26:17-0:26:21</a>:</strong>  I'd say it was one of the foundations in the roof were the most successful part of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:21">0:26:21-0:26:22</a>:</strong>  build interestingly enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:22">0:26:22-0:26:25</a>:</strong>  And I'd definitely do the same roof style again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:25">0:26:25-0:26:26</a>:</strong>  I loved the earth roof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:26">0:26:26-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  I thought it was fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:32</a>:</strong>  Insulative, it was soundproofing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:32">0:26:32-0:26:35</a>:</strong>  I really, really liked it, yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:35">0:26:35-0:26:36</a>:</strong>  Brilliant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:36">0:26:36-0:26:40</a>:</strong>  Now again, another thing that you touched on a little bit were the types of bags that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:40">0:26:40-0:26:41</a>:</strong>  you selected.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:41">0:26:41-0:26:43</a>:</strong>  So you went with polypropylene, correct?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:43">0:26:43-0:26:45</a>:</strong>  Yes, that's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:45">0:26:45-0:26:49</a>:</strong>  And those hold together a little bit stronger, but there are some other drawbacks to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:49">0:26:49-0:26:51</a>:</strong>  Could you touch on that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:51">0:26:51-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  Well obviously they're not completely natural.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:26:54</a>:</strong>  That's the drawback.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:54">0:26:54-0:26:55</a>:</strong>  It's a type of plastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:26:55">0:26:55-0:27:00</a>:</strong>  It isn't a type of plastic that's toxic and it isn't a type of plastic that leaks into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:00">0:27:00-0:27:01</a>:</strong>  the earth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:01">0:27:01-0:27:04</a>:</strong>  It's also breathable because they're woven together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:04">0:27:04-0:27:07</a>:</strong>  Otherwise the earth would not dry in the bag.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:07">0:27:07-0:27:11</a>:</strong>  So it's breathable and people often think, oh, well, hang on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:11">0:27:11-0:27:16</a>:</strong>  If it's plastic bags, it's not breathable, but it is because the bags themselves have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:16">0:27:16-0:27:22</a>:</strong>  to breathe in order for the earth to dry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:22">0:27:22-0:27:26</a>:</strong>  But yeah, the disadvantage is that they are not natural and they are not degradable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:26">0:27:26-0:27:30</a>:</strong>  Well, they will own sunlight, but in your house they're not going to degrade.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:30">0:27:30-0:27:34</a>:</strong>  However, I thought about it quite a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:34">0:27:34-0:27:40</a>:</strong>  And the amount you use of this, when you're talking about a house, how much did I use?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:40">0:27:40-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  About half a meter square of polypropylene?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:49</a>:</strong>  It's not very much when you consider how much concrete you would use for the same structure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:49">0:27:49-0:27:51</a>:</strong>  or another thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:51">0:27:51-0:27:56</a>:</strong>  So I was sort of, you know, this is a house, you can live in it forever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:56">0:27:56-0:27:59</a>:</strong>  You're using half a meter square of polypropylene.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:27:59">0:27:59-0:28:00</a>:</strong>  It's not, I don't know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:00">0:28:00-0:28:05</a>:</strong>  I weighed up the pros and cons with that and that's what I chose.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:05">0:28:05-0:28:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:06">0:28:06-0:28:10</a>:</strong>  Considering it sounds like that's one of the only non-natural materials you use that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:10">0:28:10-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  extremely good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I think so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:13">0:28:13-0:28:21</a>:</strong>  I think it's, whatever you do, at some point we are changing the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:21">0:28:21-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  And you've just got to weigh up and balance your pros and your cons.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:27">0:28:27-0:28:28</a>:</strong>  Of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:28">0:28:28-0:28:33</a>:</strong>  Now did you ever come up with any troubles with the solar degradation of that plastic?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:33">0:28:33-0:28:37</a>:</strong>  I know I've struggled with that using different types of polypropylene and different applications<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:37">0:28:37-0:28:38</a>:</strong>  in the past.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:38">0:28:38-0:28:39</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:39">0:28:39-0:28:45</a>:</strong>  And in sunlight, in direct sunlight, it degrades incredibly quickly, especially if you're in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:45">0:28:45-0:28:50</a>:</strong>  a hot climate like Turkey or if you were in, for example, Arizona or somewhere like that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:50">0:28:50-0:28:51</a>:</strong>  you know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:51">0:28:51-0:28:55</a>:</strong>  It's going to, yeah, you need it covered.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:55">0:28:55-0:28:59</a>:</strong>  We built our house, as I said, at the beginning of winter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:28:59">0:28:59-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  So the sun wasn't high in the sky and so it wasn't really getting affected.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:08</a>:</strong>  I still covered the bags and I still protected them with a shade cloth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:08">0:29:08-0:29:09</a>:</strong>  That's enough really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:09">0:29:09-0:29:11</a>:</strong>  That will do the job.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:11">0:29:11-0:29:16</a>:</strong>  On another house we built, on a workshop, it was in the summer that we did it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:16">0:29:16-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  We constructed a shade over the building site as we built so that the bags were not seeing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:23</a>:</strong>  that sunlight.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:23">0:29:23-0:29:26</a>:</strong>  But you want to plaster as quick as you can, really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:26">0:29:26-0:29:31</a>:</strong>  That was probably better for your work environment, too, in the summer in a hot climate when you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:31">0:29:31-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  doing manual labor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:35</a>:</strong>  I've done that plenty of times and I know how much of a difference a shade can make.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:35">0:29:35-0:29:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:36">0:29:36-0:29:37</a>:</strong>  Oh, yes, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:37">0:29:37-0:29:41</a>:</strong>  I think everyone would have fried it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:41">0:29:41-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  Protecting the skin and the plastic, nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:49</a>:</strong>  So what benefits or drawbacks have you observed with earthbag construction when compared to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:49">0:29:49-0:29:54</a>:</strong>  other earthen building methods such as Cobb, Adobe or Rammed Earth?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:54">0:29:54-0:29:56</a>:</strong>  Benefits and drawbacks, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:56">0:29:56-0:29:58</a>:</strong>  Cobb, Adobe, Rammed Earth, yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:29:58">0:29:58-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  Well, as I said, the main benefit of earthbag over those methods would be its durability<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:10</a>:</strong>  in terms of earthquakes, its strength, its structural strength.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:10">0:30:10-0:30:15</a>:</strong>  Another aspect is the speed at which you can get the shelter up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:15">0:30:15-0:30:22</a>:</strong>  Cobb, Adobe and Rammed Earth, all of them need each layer of the earth as you go round<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:22">0:30:22-0:30:25</a>:</strong>  has to dry before you can get to the next layer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:25">0:30:25-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  So it's a slow process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:33</a>:</strong>  I think they say it takes at least a year, maybe two, to get a Cobb house up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:33">0:30:33-0:30:37</a>:</strong>  Whereas, as I said, the earthbag, I got it up in six weeks and that was not knowing what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:37">0:30:37-0:30:38</a>:</strong>  I was doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:38">0:30:38-0:30:44</a>:</strong>  In my own experience, it really depends on the climate, much like you were talking about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:44">0:30:44-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:49</a>:</strong>  I've done Cobb buildings in two months in the past.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:49">0:30:49-0:30:50</a>:</strong>  Have you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:50">0:30:50-0:30:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah, but then we're in Senegal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:52">0:30:52-0:30:54</a>:</strong>  Right, right, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:54">0:30:54-0:30:58</a>:</strong>  So it's just drying every day and then you go back the next day and build on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:58">0:30:58-0:30:59</a>:</strong>  Yes, yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:30:59">0:30:59-0:31:03</a>:</strong>  We could often build in the morning, allow it to dry over lunch and build again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:03">0:31:03-0:31:04</a>:</strong>  That's how fast it was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:04">0:31:04-0:31:08</a>:</strong>  Right, you see, and I've seen it in the UK and you can imagine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:08">0:31:08-0:31:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah, UK is probably not the easiest place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:12">0:31:12-0:31:17</a>:</strong>  That's where it'll take a year, for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:17">0:31:17-0:31:18</a>:</strong>  What else?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:18">0:31:18-0:31:22</a>:</strong>  What are the other advantages?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:22">0:31:22-0:31:23</a>:</strong>  Or disadvantages?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:26</a>:</strong>  Yeah, the disadvantages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:26">0:31:26-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  It depends what you want to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  Cobb and Adobe are lovely if you want to go slow and take your time and you've got the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:41</a>:</strong>  time and they're even cheaper because you are really just using mud.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:41">0:31:41-0:31:43</a>:</strong>  That's all you're using.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:43">0:31:43-0:31:44</a>:</strong>  That's it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:44">0:31:44-0:31:52</a>:</strong>  In terms of ease and skills, I'm not sure that there's too much difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:52">0:31:52-0:31:54</a>:</strong>  They do seem similar in that way, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:54">0:31:54-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  Like I said, it's one of the few earthen methods that I actually haven't worked on myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:04</a>:</strong>  I was very eager to speak to you about this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:04">0:32:04-0:32:12</a>:</strong>  I don't think there's too much difference in terms of what you have to learn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:12">0:32:12-0:32:16</a>:</strong>  My experience is more with earth plasters, but with Cobb you do need to know you're getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:16">0:32:16-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  your mixture right, otherwise you don't have a stable structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:20">0:32:20-0:32:28</a>:</strong>  But yeah, I'm not sure they're more technically different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:28">0:32:28-0:32:39</a>:</strong>  What have been the most rewarding or unexpected benefits of building your own earthen house?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:43</a>:</strong>  Oh, there's so many.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:43">0:32:43-0:32:44</a>:</strong>  It's very addictive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:44">0:32:44-0:32:48</a>:</strong>  I mean, everybody I speak to who's built their own home has the same comment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:48">0:32:48-0:32:50</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I can definitely attest to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:50">0:32:50-0:32:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's addictive because you feel so empowered.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:32:54">0:32:54-0:33:01</a>:</strong>  You take earth and very, very inexpensive materials and you create a home.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:01">0:33:01-0:33:07</a>:</strong>  It's an incredible feeling that you live in and that shelters you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:07">0:33:07-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  Then you really realize what a con the rest of the building world is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:22</a>:</strong>  I mean, that people are spending their entire lives paying mortgages to live in a house<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:22">0:33:22-0:33:27</a>:</strong>  and you've just built it in a few weeks maybe even.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:27">0:33:27-0:33:28</a>:</strong>  It was very empowering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:28">0:33:28-0:33:36</a>:</strong>  It also really unleashed my creativity and that's why I think it becomes addictive because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:36">0:33:36-0:33:41</a>:</strong>  this feeling of wanting to create beautiful structures because you can make them so beautiful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:41">0:33:41-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  You can do whatever you want and after you've done one you start to see the possibilities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:47</a>:</strong>  of others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:47">0:33:47-0:33:48</a>:</strong>  It really gets going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:48">0:33:48-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I myself come from a conventional construction and engineering background and yet I was really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:33:55">0:33:55-0:34:00</a>:</strong>  drawn to not only of course the natural materials but like you said the creativity allowed in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:00">0:34:00-0:34:05</a>:</strong>  it and just how empowering it is for people who like yourself before getting started had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:05">0:34:05-0:34:10</a>:</strong>  no experience in the construction trades and you realize that you can take control of one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:10">0:34:10-0:34:13</a>:</strong>  of the fundamental needs that a person has.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:13">0:34:13-0:34:19</a>:</strong>  Yes, and actually that was something that on that land when I moved on to that land<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:19">0:34:19-0:34:23</a>:</strong>  in a tent that became very clear to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:23">0:34:23-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  There's sort of people think about survival as being food and water and actually food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  isn't your top priority.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:33</a>:</strong>  You can go a long time without food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:33">0:34:33-0:34:39</a>:</strong>  You know, if you had to you could survive weeks with very, very little food but you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:39">0:34:39-0:34:45</a>:</strong>  cannot survive a night if it's a bad night and you do not have a shelter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:45">0:34:45-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  You cannot survive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  If it's a hurricane you're dead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:34:50</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:50">0:34:50-0:34:52</a>:</strong>  Well, there's that rule of threes, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:52">0:34:52-0:34:58</a>:</strong>  It's 30 days without food, three days without water and three hours without shelter obviously<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:58">0:34:58-0:34:59</a>:</strong>  depending on the conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:34:59">0:34:59-0:35:00</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:00">0:35:00-0:35:01</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:01">0:35:01-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:02">0:35:02-0:35:04</a>:</strong>  It sort of gives you a bit of an idea of the hierarchy there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:04">0:35:04-0:35:05</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:05">0:35:05-0:35:14</a>:</strong>  I think the... have experienced that and that's why the expense that building is now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:14">0:35:14-0:35:20</a>:</strong>  and that people have to spend so much money on that very basic need feels to me very wrong.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:20">0:35:20-0:35:24</a>:</strong>  It's okay to charge lots of money for things that people don't need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:24">0:35:24-0:35:31</a>:</strong>  Then they can choose but a shelter, people don't have a choice in that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:31">0:35:31-0:35:33</a>:</strong>  To me that was the most empowering thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:36</a>:</strong>  I suddenly feel rich even though I had nothing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:36">0:35:36-0:35:42</a>:</strong>  I suddenly started to feel rich because I realized that I could just build houses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:42">0:35:42-0:35:43</a>:</strong>  It's wonderful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:43">0:35:43-0:35:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:44">0:35:44-0:35:50</a>:</strong>  It also really helps you to prioritize exactly what it is you need in your life as far as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:50">0:35:50-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  comforts and amenities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:57</a>:</strong>  It seems like you realized pretty quickly that having perhaps hot water for a shower<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:57">0:35:57-0:35:59</a>:</strong>  wasn't the most important thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:35:59">0:35:59-0:36:02</a>:</strong>  Maybe a lot of other amenities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:02">0:36:02-0:36:03</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:03">0:36:03-0:36:04</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:04">0:36:04-0:36:06</a>:</strong>  It became more or less important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:06">0:36:06-0:36:08</a>:</strong>  Yes, that's so true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:08">0:36:08-0:36:15</a>:</strong>  It's been so long now that you sort of get used to things and you don't realize how you've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:15">0:36:15-0:36:16</a>:</strong>  changed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:16">0:36:16-0:36:20</a>:</strong>  That, yes, and it's stayed with me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:20">0:36:20-0:36:26</a>:</strong>  The things that I thought I needed, I realized I didn't need at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:26">0:36:26-0:36:31</a>:</strong>  I realize now that I need other things which other people think they don't need probably.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:31">0:36:31-0:36:38</a>:</strong>  I need now, for example, nature and peace and quiet to me are like fresh air.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:38">0:36:38-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  I would happily sacrifice them for cold, for hot water just as you said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:46</a>:</strong>  I realized I didn't really need hot water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:46">0:36:46-0:36:47</a>:</strong>  No, it's absolutely right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:47">0:36:47-0:36:50</a>:</strong>  You can find ways of getting around nearly everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:36:54</a>:</strong>  I didn't have a washing machine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:54">0:36:54-0:36:55</a>:</strong>  You get really good at hand washing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:55">0:36:55-0:36:58</a>:</strong>  For example, you just get skilled in other areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:36:58">0:36:58-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  You don't have to repair all these machines that keep going wrong.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:04</a>:</strong>  It's not your problem anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:04">0:37:04-0:37:05</a>:</strong>  I don't know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:05">0:37:05-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  I think we've made our lives more difficult.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:08">0:37:08-0:37:12</a>:</strong>  I lived for a long time without any hot water or many of those amenities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:12">0:37:12-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  Now even when I have them, I don't bother to use them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:20</a>:</strong>  I just become accustomed and that's what I prefer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:20">0:37:20-0:37:24</a>:</strong>  I remember at one point wanting to go and wash my clothes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:24">0:37:24-0:37:28</a>:</strong>  It was sort of at the beginning and thinking I needed to go and borrow somebody's washing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:28">0:37:28-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  because I had something heavy to wash.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:34</a>:</strong>  I remember going to this person's house and I remember having to sit there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:34">0:37:34-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  There was a little old lady in the village.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:38</a>:</strong>  They were being kind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:38">0:37:38-0:37:44</a>:</strong>  I remember just sitting there thinking, oh, it would have been so much easier just to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:44">0:37:44-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  wash them myself because I had to sit there for two hours and have this painful conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:57</a>:</strong>  I could have just washed them by hand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:37:57">0:37:57-0:38:06</a>:</strong>  It would have been done in 15 minutes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:06">0:38:06-0:38:10</a>:</strong>  I know you've actually now moved out of that original mud home that you built and you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:10">0:38:10-0:38:13</a>:</strong>  traveling in search of a new base.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:13">0:38:13-0:38:20</a>:</strong>  Could you talk a little bit about what inspired you to move and what it is you're searching<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:20">0:38:20-0:38:24</a>:</strong>  for now that you have renewed priorities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:24">0:38:24-0:38:32</a>:</strong>  Yes, I fell in love with that piece of land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:32">0:38:32-0:38:33</a>:</strong>  It changed me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:33">0:38:33-0:38:36</a>:</strong>  I never ever thought I would leave it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:36">0:38:36-0:38:40</a>:</strong>  I very much thought I would die there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:40">0:38:40-0:38:50</a>:</strong>  Then suddenly I began to get messages that maybe I should be moving on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:50">0:38:50-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  I didn't pay them any attention really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:38:55</a>:</strong>  I sort of really resisted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:55">0:38:55-0:38:57</a>:</strong>  I didn't want to move.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:38:57">0:38:57-0:39:07</a>:</strong>  Then my neighbor, and I only had one neighbor that really was on my border, she gave her<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:07">0:39:07-0:39:13</a>:</strong>  land to her children and they bulldozed right up to the boundary.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:13">0:39:13-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  They were going to put a house there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:16">0:39:16-0:39:21</a>:</strong>  It all changed for me because it had been my secret little world where you couldn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:21">0:39:21-0:39:24</a>:</strong>  even see the house and there was no proper road down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:24">0:39:24-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  It was very, very secluded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  You could only really walk down or you needed a jeep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  No one ever could see me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:36</a>:</strong>  No one ever got there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:36">0:39:36-0:39:39</a>:</strong>  It changed it for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:39">0:39:39-0:39:44</a>:</strong>  At the same time, a friend of mine was hunting for land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:44">0:39:44-0:39:46</a>:</strong>  He was in Portugal and Spain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:46">0:39:46-0:39:49</a>:</strong>  He started sending me photos of the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:49">0:39:49-0:39:56</a>:</strong>  I just looked at it and I felt something sort of pop inside me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:39:56">0:39:56-0:40:01</a>:</strong>  I also at the same time started imagining building another house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:01">0:40:01-0:40:06</a>:</strong>  This is what I mean about this thing becomes addictive because as soon as I started thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:06">0:40:06-0:40:11</a>:</strong>  about building another mud house, I became very excited at the thought of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:11">0:40:11-0:40:13</a>:</strong>  Oh, I'm just the same way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:13">0:40:13-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:16</a>:</strong>  You just come up with all these different design ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:16">0:40:16-0:40:19</a>:</strong>  I'm like, oh, how can I integrate that feature?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:20</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:20">0:40:20-0:40:24</a>:</strong>  I had never been to Spain or Portugal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:24">0:40:24-0:40:26</a>:</strong>  I'd lived in Turkey for 20 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:26">0:40:26-0:40:28</a>:</strong>  I didn't know that I would like it or not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:28">0:40:28-0:40:31</a>:</strong>  I still wasn't sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:31">0:40:31-0:40:34</a>:</strong>  Of course, I loved that land and I couldn't give it up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:34">0:40:34-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  Then a number of things happened one after the other and I really felt I was being kicked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:39</a>:</strong>  out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:39">0:40:39-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  We had a forest fire that came very close.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:44</a>:</strong>  Oh, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:44">0:40:44-0:40:45</a>:</strong>  I saw those pictures on your blog.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:45">0:40:45-0:40:46</a>:</strong>  That's why.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:46">0:40:46-0:40:50</a>:</strong>  I thought I'd actually lost the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:50">0:40:50-0:40:52</a>:</strong>  We evacuated and I assumed that was the end of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:52">0:40:52-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  I remember cursing at the time saying, why didn't I sell the land?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:00</a>:</strong>  Now it's just a chart heap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:00">0:41:00-0:41:02</a>:</strong>  It didn't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:02">0:41:02-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  The wind changed at the last minute and it absolutely changed direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:10</a>:</strong>  You could see a line of where the burnt trees were.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:10">0:41:10-0:41:14</a>:</strong>  It was very strange.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:14">0:41:14-0:41:16</a>:</strong>  Then I started to think, you know what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:16">0:41:16-0:41:18</a>:</strong>  Things keep happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:18">0:41:18-0:41:19</a>:</strong>  Maybe I need to put my land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:19">0:41:19-0:41:20</a>:</strong>  Maybe I do need to sell it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:20">0:41:20-0:41:27</a>:</strong>  Then of course there was a military coup within a week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:27">0:41:27-0:41:30</a>:</strong>  I put the house on the market straight.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:30">0:41:30-0:41:37</a>:</strong>  It can be a motivating factor for children.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:37">0:41:37-0:41:41</a>:</strong>  Within a week, it sold actually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:41">0:41:41-0:41:46</a>:</strong>  I felt like it was sending, saying move on, move on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:46">0:41:46-0:41:51</a>:</strong>  Now I arrive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:51">0:41:51-0:41:55</a>:</strong>  I got a van and I've been traveling around looking for places.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:55">0:41:55-0:41:57</a>:</strong>  What am I looking for?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:41:57">0:41:57-0:42:02</a>:</strong>  Well, really one of the things which was upsetting me very much about where I was and one of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:02">0:42:02-0:42:08</a>:</strong>  the lessons I learned is that even though I was so independent and so I really didn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:08">0:42:08-0:42:12</a>:</strong>  need much from the outside at all, some things were still affecting me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:12">0:42:12-0:42:19</a>:</strong>  It was affecting me, for example, that people were hunting animals on my boundaries or it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:19">0:42:19-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  was affecting me that people were using pesticides on their crops and it was filtering into me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:34</a>:</strong>  It was affecting me that generally there was no sort of environmental protection for any<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:34">0:42:34-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  of the forest land around so you could see the government really were just going to wreck<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:42:44</a>:</strong>  it all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:44">0:42:44-0:42:47</a>:</strong>  It was obvious and I just didn't want to watch it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:47">0:42:47-0:42:55</a>:</strong>  What I'm looking for now is a place which is more protected, I suppose, and where the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:42:55">0:42:55-0:43:00</a>:</strong>  people around me perhaps resonate more with my own ideals, I guess.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:00">0:43:00-0:43:01</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:01">0:43:01-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  Now, before I let you go, could you tell our listeners how they can find your books, your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  blog and perhaps get in touch with you to follow your travels?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  Yes, I've got it all on www.themudhome.com.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:26</a>:</strong>  Everything is on there and there's a lot of free materials which I know people benefit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:26">0:43:26-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  There's an earthbag building PDF there which I show exactly how I built my house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:36</a>:</strong>  It's about 22 pages, I think, of pictures and explanation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:36">0:43:36-0:43:40</a>:</strong>  You can download that and there's also an earth plaster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:40">0:43:40-0:43:44</a>:</strong>  I've now got an earth plaster PDF and mini course as well which you'll see it all on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:44">0:43:44-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  that site there that you can sign up for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:48</a>:</strong>  They're all free.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:48">0:43:48-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  My On The Road blog is also on that site where you can follow my journey and see where I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:43:59</a>:</strong>  end up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:43:59">0:43:59-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  My story, Mudball, is an author.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:03">0:44:03-0:44:08</a>:</strong>  That's really what I started out wanting to be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:08">0:44:08-0:44:10</a>:</strong>  I've now become both and I love them both.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:10">0:44:10-0:44:14</a>:</strong>  I'm a natural builder but I am also an author.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:14">0:44:14-0:44:20</a>:</strong>  Mudball is my most popular book and that is the story of that house building adventure,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:20">0:44:20-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  six weeks in Turkey with not much money and no experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:34</a>:</strong>  That's a popular book and you can find that at www.themudhome.com as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:34">0:44:34-0:44:35</a>:</strong>  Marvelous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:35">0:44:35-0:44:38</a>:</strong>  If I can add my two cents, I really have benefited a lot from those resources that you've put<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:38">0:44:38-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:39">0:44:39-0:44:40</a>:</strong>  I love your book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:40">0:44:40-0:44:43</a>:</strong>  I subscribe to your newsletter and I follow your blog.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:43">0:44:43-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  I just think what you're doing is really empowering and remarkable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:50</a>:</strong>  Thank you for putting that out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:50">0:44:50-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  Thank you, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:44:52</a>:</strong>  It's really nice of you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:52">0:44:52-0:44:53</a>:</strong>  Thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:53">0:44:53-0:44:56</a>:</strong>  This has been fantastic and I really hope that we can reconnect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:44:56">0:44:56-0:45:00</a>:</strong>  I would love to see where you end up finding land and who knows, maybe we could even work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:00">0:45:00-0:45:01</a>:</strong>  together in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:01">0:45:01-0:45:04</a>:</strong>  I know I've got a lot of friends in Spain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:04">0:45:04-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  I love that area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:08</a>:</strong>  It sounds like you're traveling through areas I haven't seen before but are really high<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:08">0:45:08-0:45:09</a>:</strong>  on my list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:09">0:45:09-0:45:13</a>:</strong>  I'm learning Spanish now so Guatemala could be on the horizon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:13">0:45:13-0:45:14</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:14">0:45:14-0:45:19</a>:</strong>  We're doing a lot of projects there too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:19">0:45:19-0:45:20</a>:</strong>  It's such a fun process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:20">0:45:20-0:45:22</a>:</strong>  I really enjoyed learning Spanish.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  Of course, it's an ongoing learning experience, of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:31</a>:</strong>  I'm sure you'll get a lot out of that as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:31">0:45:31-0:45:36</a>:</strong>  Again, thank you so much for taking time and let's stay in touch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:36">0:45:36-0:45:37</a>:</strong>  Thanks, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:37">0:45:37-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  Very nice to connect with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:38">0:45:38-0:45:39</a>:</strong>  Thank you very much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:39">0:45:39-0:45:40</a>:</strong>  You take care.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:40">0:45:40-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  Bye-bye.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:46</a>:</strong>  So, before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:46">0:45:46-0:45:50</a>:</strong>  months and I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:50">0:45:50-0:45:51</a>:</strong>  Goodsy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:51">0:45:51-0:45:52</a>:</strong>  Hey buddy, what's new?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:52">0:45:52-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  Oh man, so much is happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:46:02</a>:</strong>  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:02">0:46:02-0:46:04</a>:</strong>  in one of the earlier episodes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:04">0:46:04-0:46:09</a>:</strong>  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:09">0:46:09-0:46:10</a>:</strong>  and Abundant Edge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:10">0:46:10-0:46:15</a>:</strong>  As you know, we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:15">0:46:15-0:46:18</a>:</strong>  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:18">0:46:18-0:46:24</a>:</strong>  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:24">0:46:24-0:46:30</a>:</strong>  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:30">0:46:30-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  of permaculture design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:37</a>:</strong>  Honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:37">0:46:37-0:46:38</a>:</strong>  That's life changing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:38">0:46:38-0:46:44</a>:</strong>  But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:44">0:46:44-0:46:49</a>:</strong>  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:49">0:46:49-0:46:51</a>:</strong>  of our intro to permaculture courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:51">0:46:51-0:46:57</a>:</strong>  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:57">0:46:57-0:46:59</a>:</strong>  know of available anywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:46:59">0:46:59-0:47:04</a>:</strong>  Basically with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:04">0:47:04-0:47:09</a>:</strong>  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:09">0:47:09-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  That's what I'm excited about, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:12</a>:</strong>  But yeah, what about you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:12">0:47:12-0:47:13</a>:</strong>  What's going on?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:13">0:47:13-0:47:17</a>:</strong>  Man, well, you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:17">0:47:17-0:47:18</a>:</strong>  season as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:18">0:47:18-0:47:24</a>:</strong>  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:24">0:47:24-0:47:27</a>:</strong>  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:27">0:47:27-0:47:32</a>:</strong>  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:32">0:47:32-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  to houses and it's all going to be made out of natural materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:40</a>:</strong>  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:40">0:47:40-0:47:43</a>:</strong>  methods for years and years to come.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:43">0:47:43-0:47:47</a>:</strong>  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:47">0:47:47-0:47:52</a>:</strong>  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:52">0:47:52-0:47:55</a>:</strong>  Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:55">0:47:55-0:47:59</a>:</strong>  And honestly, this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:47:59">0:47:59-0:48:00</a>:</strong>  too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:00">0:48:00-0:48:04</a>:</strong>  This little town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala, like right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:04">0:48:04-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  here on the shores of Lake Atitlan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:05">0:48:05-0:48:08</a>:</strong>  It's one of the most beautiful places in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:08">0:48:08-0:48:13</a>:</strong>  On top of that, you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:13">0:48:13-0:48:14</a>:</strong>  and alive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:14">0:48:14-0:48:20</a>:</strong>  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:20">0:48:20-0:48:24</a>:</strong>  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:24">0:48:24-0:48:29</a>:</strong>  I mean, within walking distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:29">0:48:29-0:48:30</a>:</strong>  on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:30">0:48:30-0:48:33</a>:</strong>  We've got the projects that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:33">0:48:33-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  centers, you have Charlie Rendell's Natural Bamboo Building School, you have Love Probiotics,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:44</a>:</strong>  you have Fungi Academy, and honestly, loads more alternative blow your mind type stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:44">0:48:44-0:48:47</a>:</strong>  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happened.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:47">0:48:47-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah, man, it really does.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:52</a>:</strong>  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:52">0:48:52-0:48:54</a>:</strong>  sure that they've got the skills first.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:55">0:48:55-0:48:59</a>:</strong>  Give us a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:48:59">0:48:59-0:49:03</a>:</strong>  I mean, all food and lodging in the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:03">0:49:03-0:49:07</a>:</strong>  the tuition, so this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:07">0:49:07-0:49:08</a>:</strong>  That's a great idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:08">0:49:08-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  Because I mean, people can still take just one course if that's what they're into, or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-atulya-k-bingham/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  if they can't make the full two weeks, but this will actually make the two courses more<br />
