<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:37">0:01:37-0:01:42</a>:</strong>  In today's session, I hosted a discussion on regenerative fashion with my friends and<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:49">0:01:49-0:01:53</a>:</strong>  Since these discussions are a little longer than the regular weekly episodes, I'll keep<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:01:58">0:01:58-0:02:02</a>:</strong>  First up we have Rebecca Burgess, who is the executive director of Fibershed and chair<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:17</a>:</strong>  And Burgess has built an extensive network of farmers and artisans in the Northern California<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:23">0:02:23-0:02:28</a>:</strong>  Our second panelist today is Aroha Alvarez Fernandez, sustainability entrepreneur who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:28">0:02:28-0:02:33</a>:</strong>  is one of the founders at Trace Collective and Trace Planet, an activist fashion brand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:33">0:02:33-0:02:38</a>:</strong>  and community organization on a mission to make the fashion industry a driver of environmental<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:38">0:02:38-0:02:43</a>:</strong>  regeneration and to help communities reconnect with the products they buy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:43">0:02:43-0:02:47</a>:</strong>  Really quick here before we get to the panel, we had some technical difficulties while recording<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:47">0:02:47-0:02:52</a>:</strong>  and lost a couple of the first few minutes of the call, so we jump right into Rebecca's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:52">0:02:52-0:02:54</a>:</strong>  answer a little bit abruptly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:54">0:02:54-0:02:58</a>:</strong>  But the question that I asked in the lead up to this is, what does a global regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:02:58">0:02:58-0:03:02</a>:</strong>  fashion industry look like in terms of fiber and material production?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:02">0:03:02-0:03:06</a>:</strong>  And she started by stressing the need to take care of this at a local level in order to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:06">0:03:06-0:03:10</a>:</strong>  better inform the global scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:10">0:03:10-0:03:15</a>:</strong>  Understanding frameworks from on high could work, but really the detailed responses to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:15">0:03:15-0:03:21</a>:</strong>  ecological restoration and health are going to be at the community scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:21">0:03:21-0:03:26</a>:</strong>  We need to be able to take measurements and create modeling systems based on responses<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:26">0:03:26-0:03:30</a>:</strong>  to our actions at the local level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:30">0:03:30-0:03:38</a>:</strong>  So I see the way that the global textile community starts to see benefit and positive feedback<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:38">0:03:38-0:03:44</a>:</strong>  loops, which would be lowering emissions in the atmosphere, restoring aquifers, enhancing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:44">0:03:44-0:03:46</a>:</strong>  biodiversity metrics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:46">0:03:46-0:03:53</a>:</strong>  For those feedback loops to take place, we fundamentally need every community to figure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:03:53">0:03:53-0:04:00</a>:</strong>  out how to handle aquifer restoration, how to handle soil carbon sequestration in their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:00">0:04:00-0:04:02</a>:</strong>  home communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:02">0:04:02-0:04:06</a>:</strong>  So I guess I would say the answers are decentralization.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:06">0:04:06-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  The answers are investing in communities to create these responses at the local level<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:12">0:04:12-0:04:18</a>:</strong>  and functionally to decentralize manufacturing because through the laws of thermodynamics,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:18">0:04:18-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  there's just no way we can keep up this idea of moving non-perishable goods, which we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:24">0:04:24-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  do because currently they're non-perishable, not like the food supply.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:33</a>:</strong>  We're moving them huge distances to manufacture them, but we've been doing that because we've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:33">0:04:33-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  externalized the costs of carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  So we really do need to consider the decentralization movement, which will give brands kind of a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:04:49</a>:</strong>  bespoke selection of manufacturing centers across the world that will reflect the terroir<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:49">0:04:49-0:04:50</a>:</strong>  of those regions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:50">0:04:50-0:04:56</a>:</strong>  So I think it's going to be a beautiful future if we just kind of open ourselves up to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:04:56">0:04:56-0:05:01</a>:</strong>  idea, the paradigm shift of what it means to decentralize some of these systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:01">0:05:01-0:05:03</a>:</strong>  I'll leave it there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  That's a great start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  How about you, Aurora?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:10</a>:</strong>  Tell us what you envision as a regenerative fashion future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:10">0:05:10-0:05:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so I think it's, hi Rebecca, it's nice to see you again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:15">0:05:15-0:05:24</a>:</strong>  I think it's, so to me, when it comes to regenerative fashion, I think there are three principles<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:24">0:05:24-0:05:27</a>:</strong>  that always we need to take into account.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:27">0:05:27-0:05:33</a>:</strong>  One is that it actually produced positive environmental outputs, so positive environmental<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:33">0:05:33-0:05:38</a>:</strong>  impacts, and that's where we really need to go into textile fibers that are at the moment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:38">0:05:38-0:05:42</a>:</strong>  the only ones that offer as these, and regenerative agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:42">0:05:42-0:05:47</a>:</strong>  And then there are other two layers that really relate to what Rebecca has said that is minimizing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:47">0:05:47-0:05:48</a>:</strong>  externalities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:48">0:05:48-0:05:56</a>:</strong>  At the moment, the industry has so many, such massive environmental externalities, and there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:05:56">0:05:56-0:06:02</a>:</strong>  are many ways to reduce them, but one key one is through localization, and through really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:02">0:06:02-0:06:08</a>:</strong>  opening up to the beauty of how do more local supply chains look like in the fashion industry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:08">0:06:08-0:06:10</a>:</strong>  So really minimizing externalities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:10">0:06:10-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  And then the third one, using fashion as a healing tool for society, which until now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:20</a>:</strong>  it hasn't been really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:20">0:06:20-0:06:24</a>:</strong>  So there is a lot of negative social impacts of the fashion industry that don't rely only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:24">0:06:24-0:06:31</a>:</strong>  on worker exploitation, but that relate to cultural appropriation and a lack of diversity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:31">0:06:31-0:06:32</a>:</strong>  and many issues.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:32">0:06:32-0:06:37</a>:</strong>  And I think when we talk about regenerative fashion, for sure while the core is connecting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:37">0:06:37-0:06:43</a>:</strong>  it to regenerative agriculture, we also need to think about what role can such a big industry,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:43">0:06:43-0:06:48</a>:</strong>  which is producing a good that is not necessary in terms of we have enough clothes in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:48">0:06:48-0:06:52</a>:</strong>  world to go around forever, we don't need more clothes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:52">0:06:52-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  What role does it have to play in also healing us and bringing us back together as a society?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:06:58</a>:</strong>  Fantastic observations there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:06:58">0:06:58-0:07:03</a>:</strong>  It sounds to me that the evolution of the fashion industry in order to become more regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:03">0:07:03-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  is similar to many other industries that we have, which currently bring a lot of problems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:13</a>:</strong>  in pollution, especially the food system and how this all relates in with farming, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:13">0:07:13-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  many of us are focused on now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:21</a>:</strong>  And from there, I'd like to ask what clothing production methods from the past and from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:21">0:07:21-0:07:27</a>:</strong>  indigenous cultures can inform the global clothing industry, as well as what new technologies<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:27">0:07:27-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  offer hope for responsible textile farming and manufacturing, because it seems like the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:37</a>:</strong>  two need to go hand in hand for us to be able to move forward and address the modern problems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:37">0:07:37-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  that we are seeing in this industry at large, perhaps starting with Aroha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:47</a>:</strong>  Oh, I think Rebecca will have much more to say about this because of her background expertise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:47">0:07:47-0:07:55</a>:</strong>  But so I think so there is like some new technologies that definitely are relevant here, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:07:55">0:07:55-0:08:02</a>:</strong>  when it comes to helping us really measure, you know, and leverage the latest science<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:02">0:08:02-0:08:08</a>:</strong>  when it comes to regenerative agriculture and, you know, giving farmers the guidelines<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:08">0:08:08-0:08:13</a>:</strong>  and, you know, and the visibility that they need because of the measurement tools that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:13">0:08:13-0:08:14</a>:</strong>  we have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:14">0:08:14-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  So new technologies have a role to play, but I think effectively, like you say, we need<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:19">0:08:19-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  to look into the past.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:25</a>:</strong>  And I think especially in the fashion, not especially in the fashion industry, in so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:25">0:08:25-0:08:30</a>:</strong>  many industries, but in fashion, there is this huge conversations about innovation in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:30">0:08:30-0:08:33</a>:</strong>  the in quite bizarre ways often.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:33">0:08:33-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  And it feels like we are looking to technology to save us from some problems that technology<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:40</a>:</strong>  has created.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:40">0:08:40-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  And what we need is to change our mindset and really understand that no technology is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:50</a>:</strong>  going to save us from unchecked consumption and from complete disconnection from our supply<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:50">0:08:50-0:08:51</a>:</strong>  chains.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:51">0:08:51-0:08:57</a>:</strong>  So it's effectively about looking at what are the ways that we produce throughout like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:08:57">0:08:57-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  all of our history that kept a balance with nature and recovering those practices and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:11</a>:</strong>  those technologies and understanding that, you know, some things shouldn't be scaled<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:11">0:09:11-0:09:15</a>:</strong>  and productivity shouldn't be maximized, you know, areas on that products have a price<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:15">0:09:15-0:09:18</a>:</strong>  that is that is higher and that we need to pay for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:18">0:09:18-0:09:20</a>:</strong>  I love that response.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:20">0:09:20-0:09:22</a>:</strong>  Thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:22">0:09:22-0:09:24</a>:</strong>  And I would just second all of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  And that idea that some things don't need to be maximized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:35</a>:</strong>  I was just reflecting as you were speaking about a post I saw, like a decolonizing post<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:35">0:09:35-0:09:44</a>:</strong>  was a quote from a British military official who was defining nation states in Africa,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:44">0:09:44-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  places that he'd never been.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:45">0:09:45-0:09:52</a>:</strong>  He was creating new political boundaries to define those countries, you know, politic,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:52">0:09:52-0:09:54</a>:</strong>  tax base, etc.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:54">0:09:54-0:09:57</a>:</strong>  And in the quote, it was like there are mountains I've never seen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:09:57">0:09:57-0:10:02</a>:</strong>  There are rivers I've never crossed, but I have the ability to define the future of this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:02">0:10:02-0:10:04</a>:</strong>  landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:04">0:10:04-0:10:13</a>:</strong>  And here where I am in the western part of the United States, you know, I work with tribal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:13">0:10:13-0:10:19</a>:</strong>  leaders who say, you know, you should read what the pope originally said when they sent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:19">0:10:19-0:10:25</a>:</strong>  the explorers from Spain to to the to what is now North American continent and South<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:25">0:10:25-0:10:27</a>:</strong>  American continent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:27">0:10:27-0:10:34</a>:</strong>  Anything they could see was the land of it became incorporated into the land of the Spanish,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:34">0:10:34-0:10:37</a>:</strong>  you know, into their into their government.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:37">0:10:37-0:10:39</a>:</strong>  So it wasn't about knowing landscapes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:39">0:10:39-0:10:41</a>:</strong>  It wasn't about understanding ecosystems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:41">0:10:41-0:10:47</a>:</strong>  It was just the colonizer mind is just about appropriating what you can see or you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:47">0:10:47-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  put on a paper.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:10:56</a>:</strong>  But how do we solve ecosystem collapse with that mindset of not really being intimate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:56">0:10:56-0:10:57</a>:</strong>  with anything?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:10:57">0:10:57-0:11:05</a>:</strong>  And I think we have to really that that colonized mindset is still in things like, frankly,<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:06">0:11:06-0:11:13</a>:</strong>  It's still in things that tell us what sustainability is, because it's measuring things from way<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:13">0:11:13-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  far away and appropriating and extrapolating little bits of measurement across broad landscapes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:24</a>:</strong>  It reminds me so much of the map makers from the last colonized era.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:24">0:11:24-0:11:30</a>:</strong>  This idea that you can extrapolate measurement in one thing and say everyone's doing this<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:43">0:11:43-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  indigenous heart of our planet, we all have that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  We all have an indigenous place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:11:54</a>:</strong>  We all have a place where we came from that we were connected to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:54">0:11:54-0:11:56</a>:</strong>  And some of us still have that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:11:56">0:11:56-0:12:03</a>:</strong>  But those of us who are transplants who are looking at what was the ecosystem's way of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:03">0:12:03-0:12:07</a>:</strong>  being or the way of being with ecosystems that worked like here in California, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:07">0:12:07-0:12:16</a>:</strong>  13000 years of management of redbud and sedge and all of these plants that were used for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:16">0:12:16-0:12:22</a>:</strong>  watertight baskets and some of the dress forms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:22">0:12:22-0:12:25</a>:</strong>  And those plant species like here's just one example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:25">0:12:25-0:12:30</a>:</strong>  There's an area north of us that you know about the California fires, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:36</a>:</strong>  And so you've seen these neighborhoods completely flattened in ash.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:36">0:12:36-0:12:42</a>:</strong>  Those areas in Santa Rosa, Sonoma County are areas that were historically covered like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:42">0:12:42-0:12:48</a>:</strong>  a square mile where those coffee home burns keep happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:48">0:12:48-0:12:53</a>:</strong>  They are actually in this downward slope of a huge fire corridor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:53">0:12:53-0:12:56</a>:</strong>  And that's been known for 13000 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:12:56">0:12:56-0:13:01</a>:</strong>  And that fire corridor used to hold dogbane, massive amounts of the fiber crop that supported<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:01">0:13:01-0:13:06</a>:</strong>  fish weir development, textile development, string rope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:06">0:13:06-0:13:09</a>:</strong>  It's our native hemp in California.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:09">0:13:09-0:13:13</a>:</strong>  And there was literally the Native Americans say, well, if you want to call what we were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:13">0:13:13-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  doing industrial, we were doing industrial production of this crop, but we were allowing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:22</a>:</strong>  it to reseed and rhizomatously spread.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:22">0:13:22-0:13:30</a>:</strong>  And we planted it in the fire corridor because it regenerates in those fire ecologies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:30">0:13:30-0:13:37</a>:</strong>  So that fiber system was literally consciously put in the wave of fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:37">0:13:37-0:13:42</a>:</strong>  Now for us, the colonizer mind comes in and says, let's put homes there and take up the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:42">0:13:42-0:13:45</a>:</strong>  fiber system that was indigenous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:45">0:13:45-0:13:51</a>:</strong>  And so it's just one example of kind of the, well, if you don't pay attention to landscapes,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:51">0:13:51-0:13:53</a>:</strong>  you pay the price.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:53">0:13:53-0:13:58</a>:</strong>  And I think that at this point we have, as you're saying, like this need to connect,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:13:58">0:13:58-0:14:02</a>:</strong>  but the connection isn't just because it's a nice thing to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:02">0:14:02-0:14:04</a>:</strong>  I think our survival depends on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:04">0:14:04-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  So yeah, just leave it there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:13</a>:</strong>  Well, that goes in depth to what you were talking about for your vision of a regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:13">0:14:13-0:14:20</a>:</strong>  fashion world of this decentralization that is correctly adapted to its place in its resources,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:20">0:14:20-0:14:27</a>:</strong>  as well as the biological and cultural history of a place that kind of all work in harmony<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:27">0:14:27-0:14:32</a>:</strong>  when done at a correct scale or even we'll not call correct, bad, good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:32">0:14:32-0:14:37</a>:</strong>  I don't like those labels, but something that is appropriate to the unique conditions and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:37">0:14:37-0:14:39</a>:</strong>  the context of where you find it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:39">0:14:39-0:14:45</a>:</strong>  Auroa, do you have reference to those types of things and this balance between, I guess,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:45">0:14:45-0:14:53</a>:</strong>  production methods, but also this idea of rooting the sources of your materials and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:53">0:14:53-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  the way that they're used from the way that people have interacted with them in those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:14:58</a>:</strong>  places historically?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:14:58">0:14:58-0:15:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah, we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:01">0:15:01-0:15:08</a>:</strong>  But I must say it's really difficult for us as a brand, you know, like not wearing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:08">0:15:08-0:15:09</a>:</strong>  brand hat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:09">0:15:09-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  So at the moment, so at Trace Collective, we only source linen from Western Europe and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:23</a>:</strong>  hemp from Eastern Europe, which are crops that have been grown there for like millennia<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:23">0:15:23-0:15:25</a>:</strong>  by local population.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:25">0:15:25-0:15:33</a>:</strong>  And linen in Europe has always been, but that's why the word linen comes from like, like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:33">0:15:33-0:15:37</a>:</strong>  linen and, you know, linen was the fabric that we had at home and that we did at home<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:37">0:15:37-0:15:40</a>:</strong>  and that we had knowledge of how to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:40">0:15:40-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  If you wanted clothes, you had to grow linen in your house in the past in many areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:53</a>:</strong>  So we do have kind of like talk to farmers and make sure that there was this consistency<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:53">0:15:53-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  across, you know, like history and the practices being used.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:09</a>:</strong>  But what we find really as a barrier is that we haven't been able to find local systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:09">0:16:09-0:16:15</a>:</strong>  that, you know, take, you know, grow the fabric and connect to the meals and give us the end<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:15">0:16:15-0:16:20</a>:</strong>  outputs that we need in the quantities that we need as a fashion brand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:20">0:16:20-0:16:26</a>:</strong>  So we also work with like other meals and check with them kind of like farmer integrity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:30</a>:</strong>  and like how farmers are growing and to make sure that we are avoiding like industrial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:30">0:16:30-0:16:31</a>:</strong>  farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:31">0:16:31-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  But so it's quite challenging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:39</a>:</strong>  I guess what is quite interesting and came to my mind as Rebecca was speaking is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:39">0:16:39-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  this very local quality of sustainability that we tend to forget.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:51</a>:</strong>  And I think that is a trap that we really fall into in the fashion industry and us,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:51">0:16:51-0:16:58</a>:</strong>  you know, in on in the lack of a better system where, you know, we have these big certifications<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:16:58">0:16:58-0:17:04</a>:</strong>  that at the moment are the the only the only tool that most brands have to understand what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:04">0:17:04-0:17:06</a>:</strong>  is it that they are buying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:06">0:17:06-0:17:12</a>:</strong>  But obviously, those certifications leave out so much of the local context of, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:12">0:17:12-0:17:17</a>:</strong>  like what each region and each bioregion needs and like what is sustainable there and what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:17">0:17:17-0:17:18</a>:</strong>  should be grown there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:18">0:17:18-0:17:25</a>:</strong>  You know, it's not only about growing organic cotton, but like where are you growing it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:25">0:17:25-0:17:31</a>:</strong>  And yeah, I think that's like a really interesting challenge that where I mean, effectively,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:31">0:17:31-0:17:37</a>:</strong>  you see that you need to build those close relationships with farmers and get that visibility<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:37">0:17:37-0:17:43</a>:</strong>  and like really connect to those to those origin stories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:43">0:17:43-0:17:47</a>:</strong>  If you want to go deep into what is sustainable and what is regenerative and to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:47">0:17:47-0:17:51</a>:</strong>  the impact of your of your of your production.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:51">0:17:51-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  And I must say for us, we are like only halfway there right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:54">0:17:54-0:17:55</a>:</strong>  It's really complex.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:55">0:17:55-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  I'm really glad how you touched on it there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:02</a>:</strong>  It's like fashion is a very large and multifaceted industry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:02">0:18:02-0:18:05</a>:</strong>  And so far, I've kind of been talking about it as if it were one thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:05">0:18:05-0:18:11</a>:</strong>  But there are so many steps along that line from the farmers to the distributors and all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:11">0:18:11-0:18:15</a>:</strong>  of the processes of manufacturing before it actually makes it to retail and the consumers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:15">0:18:15-0:18:16</a>:</strong>  themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:16">0:18:16-0:18:21</a>:</strong>  And so let's start back at the beginning a little bit and talk about how, like many other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:21">0:18:21-0:18:27</a>:</strong>  commodity farm products, we're often told that the only fiber production business models<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:27">0:18:27-0:18:33</a>:</strong>  that are viable are these large scale operations, much like commodity farming of food as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:33">0:18:33-0:18:40</a>:</strong>  Do you have any examples of small scale fiber producers that are respectively profitable?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:40">0:18:40-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  I know both of you kind of work at that smaller scale, maybe starting with Rebecca.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  Well, you know, it's interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  It depends on the fiber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:18:54</a>:</strong>  And I was actually just having this reflection with someone who works at a large uptake brand,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:54">0:18:54-0:18:58</a>:</strong>  global global brand yesterday.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:18:58">0:18:58-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  And I was reflecting on cotton systems because, you know, in the United States, a lot of folks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  are like, well, why, why are all the farms so big for cotton?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:15</a>:</strong>  And you know, one of the key, if not in the top three reasons for why the scale is what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:15">0:19:15-0:19:21</a>:</strong>  it is, is because that the cotton farmers in the US are competing with cotton farmers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:21">0:19:21-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  in countries that have very different relationships to hierarchy and labor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:35</a>:</strong>  And the United States, I mean, we have gone through so much in cotton systems and it shows<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:35">0:19:35-0:19:40</a>:</strong>  up in this oppression of a whole community of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:40">0:19:40-0:19:46</a>:</strong>  And it's still unfurling like that, that use of slave labor, the effects of that we are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:46">0:19:46-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  living today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  And so cotton, to me, the fact that it's gone to the scale it has is because those growers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:58</a>:</strong>  need to use mechanized equipment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:19:58">0:19:58-0:20:04</a>:</strong>  There's very few small scale growers who can remain effective because of the labor situation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:04">0:20:04-0:20:10</a>:</strong>  and that we're competing with countries whose moral arc of justice hasn't been fully expressed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:10">0:20:10-0:20:11</a>:</strong>  yet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:11">0:20:11-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  And we're still in our journey of that expression of justice coming home to roost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:19</a>:</strong>  It keeps its layer and layer and layer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:19">0:20:19-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  We keep having an expression of justice and a retraction and an expression and a retraction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  And that shows up in the agricultural systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:31</a>:</strong>  And so I think part of the reason we're so large in the US with our cotton production<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:31">0:20:31-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  is due to the fact that we're competing with countries that have been suppressing communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:37">0:20:37-0:20:43</a>:</strong>  still in many cases and that handpicking cotton is still something that's very much done in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:43">0:20:43-0:20:46</a>:</strong>  other parts of the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:46">0:20:46-0:20:50</a>:</strong>  Sometimes it's done in a just system, but in many cases it's done in an injustice system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:50">0:20:50-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  So I have a different relationship with cotton and scale because of the history in the United<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:20:57</a>:</strong>  States of slavery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:20:57">0:20:57-0:21:04</a>:</strong>  I also would say, though, that a small scale, most of the fiber producers that are profitable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:04">0:21:04-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  are using like sheep, for instance, as part of an organic crop food crop rotation where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:12</a>:</strong>  they're using sheep in their vineyard systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:12">0:21:12-0:21:19</a>:</strong>  There's very profitable wine and food production systems that can layer fiber producing animals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:19">0:21:19-0:21:20</a>:</strong>  Those are profitable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:20">0:21:20-0:21:23</a>:</strong>  You don't need a lot of animals to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:23">0:21:23-0:21:27</a>:</strong>  It's more of like an expansive market garden who might mow down their cover crop with a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:27">0:21:27-0:21:33</a>:</strong>  handful of sheep who are then sheared and maybe some of that yarn makes it out to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:33">0:21:33-0:21:34</a>:</strong>  farmer's market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:34">0:21:34-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  But the engine of the economy for a small scale grower, at least in our region, remains<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:41</a>:</strong>  the food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:41">0:21:41-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  And it's the specialty crops that continue to be the bread and butter of the agricultural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  community and the animals are part of an ecological function tool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:55</a>:</strong>  So I guess I don't have as much, it's hard for me to say like, oh, cotton should just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:21:55">0:21:55-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  be small scale and handpicked because our country has been there and it's not pretty.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:06</a>:</strong>  So I just, I don't have the same, like scale to me is all about how is justice being served<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:06">0:22:06-0:22:14</a>:</strong>  for land and people and maybe our questions around scale start getting more nuanced.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:14">0:22:14-0:22:15</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:15">0:22:15-0:22:16</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:16">0:22:16-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  Very good example there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:19">0:22:19-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  On our side, so we do know of like farmers that are profitable and making it work small<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:30</a>:</strong>  scale with flax in Europe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:30">0:22:30-0:22:37</a>:</strong>  So I know examples in Western Spain, sorry, I always get my East and West countries, Western<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:37">0:22:37-0:22:41</a>:</strong>  Spain and also in the North of France.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:41">0:22:41-0:22:48</a>:</strong>  But like it's really challenging and it's something that they emphasize all the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:48">0:22:48-0:22:49</a>:</strong>  It's just really challenging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:49">0:22:49-0:22:54</a>:</strong>  And it's because I think also when it comes to our governments, our governments and you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:22:54">0:22:54-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  know, government incentives are not incentivizing market farmers to stay small.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:08</a>:</strong>  So very often in many European countries incentives are given according, you know, like according<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:08">0:23:08-0:23:12</a>:</strong>  to the amount of land that you have, which could make sense in a way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:12">0:23:12-0:23:19</a>:</strong>  But then what that means is that farmers who have very small farms actually qualify for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:19">0:23:19-0:23:24</a>:</strong>  almost no support and they are always under pressure to sell their lands to others who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:24">0:23:24-0:23:26</a>:</strong>  are like expanding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:26">0:23:26-0:23:32</a>:</strong>  So like it's definitely like we know of examples that are working and our concern right now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:32">0:23:32-0:23:37</a>:</strong>  is like how do we protect those and how do we replicate those because there's a very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:37">0:23:37-0:23:42</a>:</strong>  clear tendency because of markets and governments to disappear.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:42">0:23:42-0:23:46</a>:</strong>  And it's just and I think there's also, sorry, just one last thought.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:46">0:23:46-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  At least in the cases that I know, there's also a part of losing cultural heritage with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:23:56</a>:</strong>  a generational change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:23:56">0:23:56-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  So it's, you know, it's really common that just newer generations don't want to work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:08</a>:</strong>  in the farms and we are losing that knowledge that, for example, when I think of Western<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:08">0:24:08-0:24:13</a>:</strong>  Spain and linen production there, it's very like an artisan knowledge where they go through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:13">0:24:13-0:24:20</a>:</strong>  all these steps of like flax transformation into linen and that is lost because, yeah,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:20">0:24:20-0:24:26</a>:</strong>  because no young people want to take on that trade because it's not where you can make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:26">0:24:26-0:24:28</a>:</strong>  most money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:28">0:24:28-0:24:31</a>:</strong>  You had mentioned smaller scale flax operations being profitable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:31">0:24:31-0:24:35</a>:</strong>  Can you give me an idea of the scale that you're referring to?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:35">0:24:35-0:24:37</a>:</strong>  No, not really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:37">0:24:37-0:24:43</a>:</strong>  In terms of land size.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:43">0:24:43-0:24:47</a>:</strong>  I don't know on the top of my head, but I could tell you afterwards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:47">0:24:47-0:24:50</a>:</strong>  I know from talking to them and no, no.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:50">0:24:50-0:24:54</a>:</strong>  I'm just thinking it's probably going to be of interest to the farmers who are on this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:54">0:24:54-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  call.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:24:58</a>:</strong>  It's something I can follow up on afterwards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:58">0:24:58-0:24:59</a>:</strong>  Fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:24:59">0:24:59-0:25:03</a>:</strong>  And Rebecca, do you have similar examples?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:03">0:25:03-0:25:08</a>:</strong>  Because you had mentioned about smaller scale operations being profitable with leather and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:08">0:25:08-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  especially animal products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  Are you also utilized or have you seen the utilization of waste products into novel or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:17</a>:</strong>  new forms of fibers?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:17">0:25:17-0:25:22</a>:</strong>  For example, unfortunately, the panelists who wasn't able to be here, Umaima has been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:22">0:25:22-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  pioneering pineapple and banana fibers as waste products from the industries in Bangladesh.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  Have you seen potential in these types of products in your area?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:37</a>:</strong>  We're getting there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:37">0:25:37-0:25:38</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:38">0:25:38-0:25:46</a>:</strong>  I think the technology company that we are excited about who's circling around California<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:46">0:25:46-0:25:51</a>:</strong>  and other parts of the world who has a bio refinery model, it's Agri loop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:51">0:25:51-0:25:56</a>:</strong>  I'm sure there's other companies too that are looking at this model where they are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:25:56">0:25:56-0:26:03</a>:</strong>  So you can use banana, pineapple, and those are not crops that work in our location because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:03">0:26:03-0:26:04</a>:</strong>  we're a more temperate climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:04">0:26:04-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  But yes, the flax tow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:14</a>:</strong>  So the shorter staple flax, we're looking at how that can be turned into maybe even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:14">0:26:14-0:26:22</a>:</strong>  a filament, but possibly just a well spun yarn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:22">0:26:22-0:26:26</a>:</strong>  It's a very tricky process because you need things not to pill, not to break.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:26">0:26:26-0:26:32</a>:</strong>  And so these shorter fibers that you see in so many food crops, it's a real science to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:32">0:26:32-0:26:35</a>:</strong>  get that to be a durable textile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:35">0:26:35-0:26:42</a>:</strong>  So the systems we're looking at are if cannabis focused hemp growing, it creates very bushy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:42">0:26:42-0:26:46</a>:</strong>  crops, but that's primarily where the American hemp industry so far has gone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:46">0:26:46-0:26:51</a>:</strong>  Of course, we've overproduced, can have been producing, we have flooded these markets,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:51">0:26:51-0:26:57</a>:</strong>  but those who end up retaining in the hemp market, there's definitely ways that we could<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:26:57">0:26:57-0:27:03</a>:</strong>  use those, even those bifurcated stems and through certain systems, those shorter staple<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:03">0:27:03-0:27:07</a>:</strong>  fibers from hemp or flax could be used into yarn development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:07">0:27:07-0:27:14</a>:</strong>  It will take more technology because we don't have a lot of fiber focused hemp growers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:14">0:27:14-0:27:19</a>:</strong>  I can't even, I mean, maybe there's some on the panel that I haven't seen, but the economics<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:19">0:27:19-0:27:24</a>:</strong>  work in the US for people just to grow hemp for fiber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:24">0:27:24-0:27:28</a>:</strong>  We're still trying to figure out all the different ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:28">0:27:28-0:27:33</a>:</strong>  You need value added systems because in so many ways for hemp to work, for instance,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:33">0:27:33-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  it's not just the textile manufacturing systems you need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:41</a>:</strong>  You need to understand how to create the herd economy and is the herd going into animal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:41">0:27:41-0:27:42</a>:</strong>  bedding?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:42">0:27:42-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  Is it going into hemp creep or building?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:50</a>:</strong>  And all of those systems, all the value addition systems have to be invested in at once for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:50">0:27:50-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  the farmer to be able to make use of all the products that come off that crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:27:56</a>:</strong>  It's a dynamic crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:27:56">0:27:56-0:28:02</a>:</strong>  But yeah, I think it's just a matter of time before we see more agricultural material that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:02">0:28:02-0:28:06</a>:</strong>  wouldn't traditionally be used for a textile being used.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:06">0:28:06-0:28:11</a>:</strong>  It's just an investment issue more so than anything else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:11">0:28:11-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:17</a>:</strong>  The infrastructure has to be easy for the producers to access because if there pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:17">0:28:17-0:28:23</a>:</strong>  much any point of friction or difficulty in the process is going to marginalize it as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:23">0:28:23-0:28:27</a>:</strong>  a waste product the way it has been up until now, I would imagine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:27">0:28:27-0:28:28</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:28">0:28:28-0:28:29</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:29">0:28:29-0:28:35</a>:</strong>  And I hope that when we have these kind of investment conversations about building up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:35">0:28:35-0:28:40</a>:</strong>  our manufacturing sector in our country that people will take textile into consideration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:40">0:28:40-0:28:46</a>:</strong>  because it's just it's a wonderful part of the sector of the economy that we could be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:46">0:28:46-0:28:48</a>:</strong>  breathing more life into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:48">0:28:48-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:56</a>:</strong>  Well, it seems to me that the difficulty here is making the argument or making the case<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:28:56">0:28:56-0:29:03</a>:</strong>  that this can compete with the synthetic fibers and especially dyes and other processes like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:03">0:29:03-0:29:08</a>:</strong>  nylon and acrylic and others that have flooded the market and become the cheap alternative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:08">0:29:08-0:29:14</a>:</strong>  that is really fueling fast fashion and these other symptoms of the industry at large that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:14">0:29:14-0:29:20</a>:</strong>  are difficult to compete with in this decentralized and bespoke industry that we're somewhat advocating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:20">0:29:20-0:29:21</a>:</strong>  for here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:21">0:29:21-0:29:30</a>:</strong>  Can you make the case for not only why this is important on a ecological, I guess, aspect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:30">0:29:30-0:29:36</a>:</strong>  or perspective, but what are the other benefits that can help to bring meaning behind the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:36">0:29:36-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  higher costs of a better way of producing all types of fibers and clothing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:45</a>:</strong>  Starting with Aroha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:45">0:29:45-0:29:46</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:46">0:29:46-0:29:53</a>:</strong>  Right now, we need to completely change how our textile pie looks like.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:29:53">0:29:53-0:30:00</a>:</strong>  You know, at the moment, I think like latest data from textile exchange is that 63 percent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:00">0:30:00-0:30:04</a>:</strong>  of global textile production is synthetics, which is insane.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:04">0:30:04-0:30:11</a>:</strong>  No, it's like we are using non-renewable resources to produce fabrics that are going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:11">0:30:11-0:30:17</a>:</strong>  to stay there forever, kind of damage all across the supply chain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:17">0:30:17-0:30:24</a>:</strong>  And so, I mean, are there other arguments besides the environmental one?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:24">0:30:24-0:30:29</a>:</strong>  I think the environmental one is the most important one, but I think there is a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:29">0:30:29-0:30:34</a>:</strong>  to speak about, you know, just building this connection with the story behind the product<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:34">0:30:34-0:30:38</a>:</strong>  that you buy, you know, and I think just put it in a very blunt way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:38">0:30:38-0:30:44</a>:</strong>  I personally don't want to wear plastic, you know, it's like, I mean, and it's like quite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:44">0:30:44-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  basic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:50</a>:</strong>  And we're getting used to it, but just wearing a polyester t-shirt as opposed to wearing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:50">0:30:50-0:30:57</a>:</strong>  a cotton t-shirt or like a wool jumper, it's a completely different way on how it interacts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:30:57">0:30:57-0:31:03</a>:</strong>  with your skin, you know, just the connection that you create with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:03">0:31:03-0:31:10</a>:</strong>  So I think there's also like this human, you know, not only on the touch, but also this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:10">0:31:10-0:31:14</a>:</strong>  human storyline of, well, you're buying a product, this product has a story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:14">0:31:14-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  You can be buying something that is like completely man-made, completely opaque, completely polluting,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:23</a>:</strong>  or you can be buying something that you can trace back, hopefully, you know, like if we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  get to a degree of transparency in the fashion industry, that you can trace back to a farmer,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:38</a>:</strong>  you know, and to the land that is around you and that when you don't need it anymore, we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:38">0:31:38-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  will go back into that land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  So obviously I think the environmental argument is the most important one, but there's also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:51</a>:</strong>  this really important part of reconnecting with the products that we buy and understanding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:51">0:31:51-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  how in a way we, you know, like we are, we're only a small part of the supply chain, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:04</a>:</strong>  There's so much that happens before us and so much that happens after and our decision<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:04">0:32:04-0:32:08</a>:</strong>  of what kind of product do we purchase creates that story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:08">0:32:08-0:32:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:09">0:32:09-0:32:14</a>:</strong>  So just to reflect, I love everything that you've said, and just to reflect on the question<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:14">0:32:14-0:32:16</a>:</strong>  about affordability or how do we compete?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:16">0:32:16-0:32:18</a>:</strong>  I mean, is that okay?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:18">0:32:18-0:32:25</a>:</strong>  Well, I've been thinking a lot about the transformation of this industry into something that includes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:25">0:32:25-0:32:31</a>:</strong>  service and experience, and instead of just pumping out goods, which has already been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:31">0:32:31-0:32:39</a>:</strong>  mentioned, like we're flooded, we're over consuming, we have surpluses that we aren't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:45</a>:</strong>  even there's inventory surpluses, there's consumer goods that are at surplus that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:45">0:32:45-0:32:51</a>:</strong>  already on the rack that get burned there or incinerated because they don't get sold<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:51">0:32:51-0:32:52</a>:</strong>  too much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:32:53</a>:</strong>  There's already too much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:32:53">0:32:53-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  So I'm wondering about the industry, if looking at a model of service whereby you take a higher<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:06</a>:</strong>  priced good and you, you know, and there are businesses doing this, but you start bringing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:06">0:33:06-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  in a culture of repair, not just again, of company coming in and using the idea of circularity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:21</a>:</strong>  as another form of centralizing wealth and power, but to think about decentralizing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:25</a>:</strong>  process of making sure clothing circulates in a community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:25">0:33:25-0:33:29</a>:</strong>  Like we always say like local dollars, you want a dollar to circulate as much as possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:29">0:33:29-0:33:35</a>:</strong>  The most beautiful, prosperous communities are where currency circulates over and over<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:35">0:33:35-0:33:39</a>:</strong>  and over again in that community and does not get extracted out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:39">0:33:39-0:33:41</a>:</strong>  Clothing is a similar, it's a currency.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:41">0:33:41-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  How can you keep it circulating in the community for as long as possible?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:51</a>:</strong>  What are the beautiful strategies that we've been missing because we've moved so quickly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:33:57</a>:</strong>  into the idea of disposability, but what are the beautiful ways of keeping the clothing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:33:57">0:33:57-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  in play through trading that clothing together freely, taking the commodification out, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:09</a>:</strong>  could some of these smaller brands who have a focus on their community or even large brands,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:09">0:34:09-0:34:13</a>:</strong>  I don't know what their strategy would be, but the idea of hosting the clothing swap,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:13">0:34:13-0:34:17</a>:</strong>  hosting, we hosted a mending bar at a design school in San Francisco.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:17">0:34:17-0:34:23</a>:</strong>  People came and drank some beer and sewed their buttons and changed their hemlines.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:23">0:34:23-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  We rolled sewing machines in and needles and threads so that the culture of repair became<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  a true culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  And so the service there was creating the bar and getting the machines and the tools,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:42</a>:</strong>  but the experience was people sitting around and talking to each other and having a good<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:42">0:34:42-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  time connecting socially while keeping their clothes in play.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  And then people started trading their clothing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:34:52</a>:</strong>  People started putting on each other's pieces.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:52">0:34:52-0:34:56</a>:</strong>  We put a photo shoot together and we brought a photographer that we work with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:34:56">0:34:56-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  So she took photos of everyone's pieces and they got a photo of their mended piece.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:02">0:35:02-0:35:05</a>:</strong>  So we can slow fast fashion down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:05">0:35:05-0:35:10</a>:</strong>  And I don't think all the business models should be nor should we be incentivizing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:10">0:35:10-0:35:14</a>:</strong>  big companies just to put boxes in their stores.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:14">0:35:14-0:35:17</a>:</strong>  Here come back and get a discount on your next thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:17">0:35:17-0:35:21</a>:</strong>  Like we shouldn't use circularity as an excuse to grow this system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:21">0:35:21-0:35:27</a>:</strong>  We need systems that slow the whole thing down and change the consumption model so that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:27">0:35:27-0:35:33</a>:</strong>  maybe a higher priced good that's a hundred percent natural fiber has a way longer arc<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:34</a>:</strong>  of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:34">0:35:34-0:35:39</a>:</strong>  So if you amortize the cost of it, it actually is saving you money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:39">0:35:39-0:35:43</a>:</strong>  My great grandmother said, I'm too poor to buy cheap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:43">0:35:43-0:35:45</a>:</strong>  Like I can't afford cheap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:45">0:35:45-0:35:46</a>:</strong>  It's crazy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:46">0:35:46-0:35:47</a>:</strong>  What are you doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:47">0:35:47-0:35:49</a>:</strong>  It's going to fall apart.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:49">0:35:49-0:35:55</a>:</strong>  So if we have this, that adage, if we take that forward and we say, well, people don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:55">0:35:55-0:35:56</a>:</strong>  have enough money upfront.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:35:56">0:35:56-0:36:00</a>:</strong>  So can you like slowly make a payment on that thing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:00">0:36:00-0:36:01</a>:</strong>  That's a little higher price.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:01">0:36:01-0:36:02</a>:</strong>  That's already in existence.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:02">0:36:02-0:36:06</a>:</strong>  Some of the brands I know and love allow you to pay $15 a month.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:06">0:36:06-0:36:09</a>:</strong>  And after, you know, four months you own it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:09">0:36:09-0:36:10</a>:</strong>  That's another way we could help.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:10">0:36:10-0:36:17</a>:</strong>  But I think we have to create services, experiences, decentralize the idea of circularity, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:17">0:36:17-0:36:23</a>:</strong>  maybe some of these brands will also find somewhat of a profit model in some of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:23">0:36:23-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  I don't, I'm not all for finding ways to profiteer off a de-growth model, but you know, we all,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:35</a>:</strong>  there might be strategies that are still in service to the social repair work and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:35">0:36:35-0:36:39</a>:</strong>  fabric repair work that we all have at hand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:39">0:36:39-0:36:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:40">0:36:40-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  I love the story of that event and I've been to similar ones myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:48</a>:</strong>  I wish that there was a bit more of a culture, especially on the masculine side of things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:48">0:36:48-0:36:52</a>:</strong>  in interacting with clothing and repair and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:52">0:36:52-0:36:55</a>:</strong>  And I know that there is another cultures and it's something that I look forward to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:55">0:36:55-0:36:56</a>:</strong>  reconnecting with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:36:56">0:36:56-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  I'm fortunate that both my partner and her mother know how to sew and are often mending<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:04</a>:</strong>  things that I destroy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:04">0:37:04-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  But it seems like re reinvigorating the interaction and the process of the things that we own<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:14</a>:</strong>  can more than justify the higher price.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:14">0:37:14-0:37:18</a>:</strong>  Like you were mentioning, when you look at it as something that is an investment as much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:18">0:37:18-0:37:22</a>:</strong>  as you would perhaps, you know, investing in a house or a piece of land, something that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:22">0:37:22-0:37:27</a>:</strong>  going to be a major presence in a longer portion of your life, rather than something that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:27">0:37:27-0:37:35</a>:</strong>  kind of go through your whims and through your wants and is transitory in that process<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:35">0:37:35-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  Which makes me wonder, because of all of the positive aspects of reconnecting with these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:46</a>:</strong>  things and I know for myself too, I value things more when I spend more money on them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:46">0:37:46-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  And I've certainly heard that adage of not being wealthy enough to buy cheap things certainly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:54</a>:</strong>  applies for tools as well since my background is more in construction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:54">0:37:54-0:37:57</a>:</strong>  But it definitely applies to tools.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:37:57">0:37:57-0:38:02</a>:</strong>  It really does, it has very broad appeal and broad application.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:02">0:38:02-0:38:07</a>:</strong>  And this makes me wonder, like, what are some of the biggest roadblocks?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:07">0:38:07-0:38:15</a>:</strong>  What are some of the biggest hurdles for the expansion of regenerative textiles and fashion?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:15">0:38:15-0:38:16</a>:</strong>  Where are you feeling the most pushback?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:16">0:38:16-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  You can go, go ahead, Rekha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:21</a>:</strong>  No, no, no.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  If you want to think more about it, I can jump in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:26">0:38:26-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  No, no, I'm happy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:34</a>:</strong>  I mean, basically, I think there are two sides, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:34">0:38:34-0:38:39</a>:</strong>  One is like market, so one side that is market incentives.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:48</a>:</strong>  And we have there like consumer demands, but also like other, you know, like set of incentives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:48">0:38:48-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  around policy and, you know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:57</a>:</strong>  And so when it comes to consumers, definitely we are talking about price points.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:38:57">0:38:57-0:39:01</a>:</strong>  But like, again, it's what Rebecca was saying and you were saying, you know, it's we just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:01">0:39:01-0:39:06</a>:</strong>  need to step away from this culture that has been fed into us of like, we need to have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:06">0:39:06-0:39:10</a>:</strong>  so many different things, you know, and go back to actually having a few things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:10">0:39:10-0:39:14</a>:</strong>  we really treasure and that we want to keep for life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:14">0:39:14-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  But it's very difficult for consumers alone to make that mindset switch, you know, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  taking into account all of market dynamics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  And I think, you know, effectively the problem today with fashion is that it's much more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:38</a>:</strong>  profitable for a brand to not be regenerative and to be very damaging, but to actually take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:38">0:39:38-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  responsibility for their supply chain and take responsibility for the products that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:47</a>:</strong>  they put out on the world, because that's also a really important component for all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:47">0:39:47-0:39:52</a>:</strong>  companies in the world, not only talking about, you know, fashion, but like companies are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:52">0:39:52-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  not taking responsibility for what they put out, you know, like responsibilities eventually,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:40:01</a>:</strong>  you know, passed on to the consumer and then to the government, you know, and this happens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:01">0:40:01-0:40:06</a>:</strong>  in fashion, but it happens also when you buy a bottle of Coke, you know, like, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:06">0:40:06-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  the ways that is produced throughout the process is not something that companies are taking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:12</a>:</strong>  responsibility for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:12">0:40:12-0:40:18</a>:</strong>  And that's because like, they don't have to basically, you know, like we can get away<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:18">0:40:18-0:40:21</a>:</strong>  with not doing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:21">0:40:21-0:40:31</a>:</strong>  So I think a really important enabler is, you know, governments stepping up to level<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:31">0:40:31-0:40:32</a>:</strong>  the playing field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:32">0:40:32-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  And this is something that in the UK has been discussed for a while.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  And for example, last year, I don't know, my time is quite fluffy since the pandemic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  happened.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  Maybe this was two years ago, but there was a vote in parliament to put that tax on fast<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:50</a>:</strong>  fashion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:50">0:40:50-0:40:55</a>:</strong>  And it was for me, an historic moment, you know, like to say like, this makes so much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:40:55">0:40:55-0:41:00</a>:</strong>  sense because, you know, these companies are damaging the planet and we're all going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:00">0:41:00-0:41:01</a>:</strong>  have to pay for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:01">0:41:01-0:41:03</a>:</strong>  But unfortunately, it wasn't voted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:03">0:41:03-0:41:05</a>:</strong>  It didn't pass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:05">0:41:05-0:41:14</a>:</strong>  Which, so I think, you know, one of the key barriers is the inability to compete evenly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:14">0:41:14-0:41:20</a>:</strong>  And I think for that to happen, there needs to be government intervention, but for government<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:20">0:41:20-0:41:23</a>:</strong>  intervention to happen, there needs to be enough citizen support, you know, so there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:23">0:41:23-0:41:28</a>:</strong>  is like a lot that needs to happen around like raising awareness and consumers speaking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:33</a>:</strong>  up and voting with their purchase, but also voting, you know, like writing to their MP<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:33">0:41:33-0:41:40</a>:</strong>  and like writing to fashion brands and showing that there is this movement and distraction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:40">0:41:40-0:41:44</a>:</strong>  And I also, I think there is like another part that I'm sure like Rebecca and I mean,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:44">0:41:44-0:41:50</a>:</strong>  you guys are climate farmers can really talk about, but it's making sure that there are,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:50">0:41:50-0:41:57</a>:</strong>  there is enough support for, you know, like when it comes to farmers to be able to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:41:57">0:41:57-0:42:04</a>:</strong>  this transition towards more regenerative practices.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:04">0:42:04-0:42:11</a>:</strong>  And when in terms of know-how, financial support, measurement, visibility, but also that there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  is enough demand from fashion brands to really like make sure that if financially they saw.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:20</a>:</strong>  Love everything that you said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:20">0:42:20-0:42:27</a>:</strong>  And I do feel like we're going to need the role of our citizen, our role as citizens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:27">0:42:27-0:42:35</a>:</strong>  has to take a very, we need to ramp up because as policies are shaped to incentivize regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:35">0:42:35-0:42:41</a>:</strong>  agriculture or smaller scale agriculture, the impediment to the regulatory frameworks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:41">0:42:41-0:42:45</a>:</strong>  that we need and the incentives frameworks that we need has been the role, at least in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:45">0:42:45-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  ag in the United States of Monsanto now owned by Bayer or Syngenta or DuPont or Dow, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:43:02</a>:</strong>  those companies have been shaping farm policy in the United States for quite some time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:02">0:43:02-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  So as fashion becomes a target for regulation, we have the same issues to be concerned about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:11</a>:</strong>  who is going to be at the table shaping that policy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:11">0:43:11-0:43:19</a>:</strong>  Our governor recently appointed, I found out a circular economy round table and appointed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:19">0:43:19-0:43:23</a>:</strong>  the largest textile companies to the table.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:23">0:43:23-0:43:26</a>:</strong>  The NGOs weren't asked to participate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:26">0:43:26-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  So I have to have a little conversation with our state government about what's going on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:30">0:43:30-0:43:32</a>:</strong>  with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:32">0:43:32-0:43:37</a>:</strong>  So I do think we are all, you know, there's this huge push to say fashion needs to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:37">0:43:37-0:43:43</a>:</strong>  regulated, but we have to be extremely careful that we are ready as a society to step up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:43">0:43:43-0:43:49</a>:</strong>  and make those public comments to get into those halls of power because those policies<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:49">0:43:49-0:43:54</a>:</strong>  could very easily start greasing the wheels for exactly what we don't want because that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:54">0:43:54-0:43:59</a>:</strong>  what's happened in agriculture and fashion could just be another pitfall if we don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:43:59">0:43:59-0:44:01</a>:</strong>  step up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:01">0:44:01-0:44:06</a>:</strong>  So I think, yeah, we need to level the playing field and regulation has a position in that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:06">0:44:06-0:44:12</a>:</strong>  but regulation has to be, again, carefully watchdogged by many for this to come out in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:12">0:44:12-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  the way that we don't just have ecological collapse and biodiversity collapse and human,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:21</a>:</strong>  you know, by humans, which is really exactly where we're headed at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:21">0:44:21-0:44:26</a>:</strong>  So there's work to turn this around, but we can't have the fox guarding the chicken<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:26">0:44:26-0:44:30</a>:</strong>  coop in the leveling of the playing field process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:30">0:44:30-0:44:37</a>:</strong>  The other thing about regenerative ag, because farm policy has been shaped so long by conglomerates<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:37">0:44:37-0:44:45</a>:</strong>  who make money off of patents and proprietary chemistry, we have a real problem with thoughtful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:45">0:44:45-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  technical assistance providers, meaning who's on the landscape helping the agrarian community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:44:55</a>:</strong>  make the transitions in, let's say, production agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:44:55">0:44:55-0:45:01</a>:</strong>  In the US, unlike the rest of other parts of the world, the US still, the large farms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:01">0:45:01-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  technically are the suppliers of our fiber and food in many cases.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:11</a>:</strong>  We do have some pockets of decentralized food and fiber production, but production ag is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:11">0:45:11-0:45:16</a>:</strong>  still predominantly what's here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:16">0:45:16-0:45:24</a>:</strong>  And I just, I have a problem when I walk into production ag systems and I even have money<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:24">0:45:24-0:45:31</a>:</strong>  in my pocket from whatever a grant or support to have that farmer make a transition to multi-species<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:31">0:45:31-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  cover cropping or compost applications versus synthetic nitrogen use, or let's wean off<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:38">0:45:38-0:45:45</a>:</strong>  these chemicals and move here to these other practices, or let's focus on soil biology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:45">0:45:45-0:45:47</a>:</strong>  There's knowledge gaps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:47">0:45:47-0:45:52</a>:</strong>  It doesn't mean people aren't trying and there aren't people trying to bridge these deltas,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:52">0:45:52-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  but there are functionally knowledge gaps in the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:46:01</a>:</strong>  And that is because our land grant universities in the US have also been predominantly bought.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:01">0:46:01-0:46:06</a>:</strong>  In many cases, the departments are very influenced by private dollars coming from the same companies<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:06">0:46:06-0:46:07</a>:</strong>  that are shaping policy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:07">0:46:07-0:46:14</a>:</strong>  We know all this, but I think it really shows up when you're trying to make change and you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:14">0:46:14-0:46:20</a>:</strong>  don't have the right technical assistance, money might even start rolling in, like governments<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:20">0:46:20-0:46:22</a>:</strong>  are making shifts, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:22">0:46:22-0:46:25</a>:</strong>  Governments are starting to do little things, at least at the state and the county level<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:25">0:46:25-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  where we are to incentivize a different form of agriculture, but then who's bridging your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:32</a>:</strong>  knowledge gaps?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:32">0:46:32-0:46:37</a>:</strong>  Because there's like a literally, as you were saying, like it takes one generation to lose<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:37">0:46:37-0:46:39</a>:</strong>  a textile recipe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:39">0:46:39-0:46:45</a>:</strong>  It can take one generation to lose an understanding of how to do organic agriculture without tilling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:45">0:46:45-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  the soil to pieces.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:46:54</a>:</strong>  You know, we have this move to no-till, but I saw some recent status of like Vermont no-till,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:54">0:46:54-0:46:58</a>:</strong>  like they're seeing so much more herbicide runoff in their streams because no-till is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:46:58">0:46:58-0:47:02</a>:</strong>  coming with herbicide use in mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:02">0:47:02-0:47:08</a>:</strong>  That's not the solution to trying to reduce soil disturbance and build soil carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:08">0:47:08-0:47:14</a>:</strong>  It's not that we then come with herbicides in large quantities to solve for our soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:14">0:47:14-0:47:15</a>:</strong>  disturbance issues.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:15">0:47:15-0:47:18</a>:</strong>  So again, we just see knowledge gaps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:18">0:47:18-0:47:25</a>:</strong>  So I really, really hope, again, just to summarize, we step up as citizens and make sure we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:25">0:47:25-0:47:30</a>:</strong>  shaping the regulation and incentives policies and making public comments when those opportunities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:30">0:47:30-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  arise, that we're supporting in the United States a different way to bridge the knowledge<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  gap than what the chemical industries have given us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:45</a>:</strong>  And that we really support each other to have solutions that are decentralized, not patented<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:45">0:47:45-0:47:47</a>:</strong>  and not just proprietary.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:47">0:47:47-0:47:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah, thanks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:49">0:47:49-0:47:51</a>:</strong>  Good question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:51">0:47:51-0:47:56</a>:</strong>  Okay, so now we've covered all of the bad news.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:47:56">0:47:56-0:48:00</a>:</strong>  These are the things that are in your way that are causing this to be difficult to implement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:00">0:48:00-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  or to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  Let's talk about some of the things that have given you hope or inspired you that things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:05">0:48:05-0:48:07</a>:</strong>  are starting to move in the right direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:07">0:48:07-0:48:15</a>:</strong>  Oromo, what have you seen in your line of work that has given you that hope?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:15">0:48:15-0:48:21</a>:</strong>  So to me, what gives me a lot of hope is that now we are talking about regenerative agriculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:21">0:48:21-0:48:27</a>:</strong>  in fashion a lot more, not a lot, you know, in objective terms, we should talk about it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:27">0:48:27-0:48:29</a>:</strong>  much more, but a lot more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:29">0:48:29-0:48:33</a>:</strong>  And I feel like this has been a change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:33">0:48:33-0:48:39</a>:</strong>  And I would love to hear from you, Rebecca, when do you think, you know, you saw this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:39">0:48:39-0:48:40</a>:</strong>  change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:40">0:48:40-0:48:45</a>:</strong>  I've seen a massive change in the last two years, which is since we've been working on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:45">0:48:45-0:48:46</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:46">0:48:46-0:48:50</a>:</strong>  And I don't know if it's like I'm looking harder at it, but really, when we started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:50">0:48:50-0:48:54</a>:</strong>  that trace, it was very difficult to find people holding this conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:54">0:48:54-0:48:58</a>:</strong>  Fibershed, I would say, was the only one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:48:58">0:48:58-0:49:06</a>:</strong>  And suddenly, in the last years, thanks to the work of like the Savory Institute and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:06">0:49:06-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  some very big fashion brands, obviously Patagonia, some very big fashion brands are starting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:17</a>:</strong>  this conversation of how they can embed, you know, like environmental regeneration and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:17">0:49:17-0:49:21</a>:</strong>  regenerative agriculture in their supply chains.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:21">0:49:21-0:49:26</a>:</strong>  And I think that's really important because, you know, ultimately, they are the people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:26">0:49:26-0:49:33</a>:</strong>  that have the microphone in a lot of occasions and a, you know, just putting these in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:33">0:49:33-0:49:40</a>:</strong>  conversation and their ability to reach consumers with this message is really important because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:40">0:49:40-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  I mean, we here all understand, you know, that a nature based solutions are key to fighting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:52</a>:</strong>  climate change and that regenerative agriculture has a very important role.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:52">0:49:52-0:49:58</a>:</strong>  But most of the of the mindset and the conversation around sustainability is in damaging this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:49:58">0:49:58-0:50:02</a>:</strong>  and not in actually healing and repairing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:02">0:50:02-0:50:06</a>:</strong>  And the fact that we are starting to see, you know, like in different industries, these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:06">0:50:06-0:50:15</a>:</strong>  pockets and these like organizations that are really amplifying the, you know, the potential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:15">0:50:15-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  of regenerative agriculture and the potential to heal our planet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:21">0:50:21-0:50:28</a>:</strong>  It gives me so much hope, you know, it just feels like there is momentum and lots of good<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:28">0:50:28-0:50:29</a>:</strong>  things can happen from this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:29">0:50:29-0:50:34</a>:</strong>  Like, as Rebecca is saying, if we if we get the right people around the table and we and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:34">0:50:34-0:50:37</a>:</strong>  we make sure that we get the right policies around the table.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:37">0:50:37-0:50:38</a>:</strong>  Nicely said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:38">0:50:38-0:50:39</a>:</strong>  I agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:39">0:50:39-0:50:44</a>:</strong>  We've got a lot of traction that's starting to build with conversations like this, where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:44">0:50:44-0:50:46</a>:</strong>  we're bridging regenerative ag and fashion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:46">0:50:46-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  I mean, these are new conversations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:50">0:50:50-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  I mean, some you'll see some brands who are kind of coming out the gate with with claims<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:50:59</a>:</strong>  and comments and and work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:50:59">0:50:59-0:51:02</a>:</strong>  And, you know, I see all of it as a gradient.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:02">0:51:02-0:51:07</a>:</strong>  Like we we just need to keep pushing on the leading edge of the work all the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:07">0:51:07-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  And hopefully hopefully, you know, just a few good players keep being really good role<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:16</a>:</strong>  models for what this can look like.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:16">0:51:16-0:51:22</a>:</strong>  We can keep setting the foundations for everyone to kind of jump on board who may not have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:22">0:51:22-0:51:26</a>:</strong>  been having the privilege to pay enough attention to the sector, which would be the wearer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:26">0:51:26-0:51:30</a>:</strong>  In those cases, they don't have the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:30">0:51:30-0:51:35</a>:</strong>  They're going to need to trust some of the new transparency tools that we bring in place<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:35">0:51:35-0:51:38</a>:</strong>  and localized, localized, localized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:38">0:51:38-0:51:41</a>:</strong>  So you can walk in those fields and understand what's happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:41">0:51:41-0:51:48</a>:</strong>  The distance between the wearer and the field is a is a chasm that needs to be bridged because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:48">0:51:48-0:51:53</a>:</strong>  ultimately we need to have sensitivity for how these things are grown and produced.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:53">0:51:53-0:51:54</a>:</strong>  But anyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:54">0:51:54-0:51:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:55">0:51:55-0:51:57</a>:</strong>  So, you know, I think we should be, should I be answering anything in the chat?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:57">0:51:57-0:51:59</a>:</strong>  There's some brilliant questions in here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:51:59">0:51:59-0:52:00</a>:</strong>  There's some really good questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:00">0:52:00-0:52:02</a>:</strong>  And we're going to start with them real soon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:02">0:52:02-0:52:06</a>:</strong>  I want to ask one last question before we turn it over to listener questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:06">0:52:06-0:52:12</a>:</strong>  And that is, how can people who are not directly involved in the fashion industry or the textile<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:12">0:52:12-0:52:18</a>:</strong>  or the farming industry help to move the needle in the right direction in this entire, this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:18">0:52:18-0:52:21</a>:</strong>  dire aspect of our culture?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:21">0:52:21-0:52:22</a>:</strong>  Rebecca.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:22">0:52:22-0:52:28</a>:</strong>  Oh, how to move the needle if you're not already involved in the industry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:28">0:52:28-0:52:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:29">0:52:29-0:52:35</a>:</strong>  Well, I think right now there's opportunities to, again, just keep your clothing in play.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:35">0:52:35-0:52:43</a>:</strong>  So whatever you're wearing, there's a wonderful Tiwa Pueblo tribal elder or leader, I would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:43">0:52:43-0:52:48</a>:</strong>  say he's not quite yet an elder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:53</a>:</strong>  And so anyway, I was just hearing stories about cotton production in the Southwest before<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:52:53">0:52:53-0:53:01</a>:</strong>  the land was colonized and clothing made of this cotton was considered sacred and clothing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:01">0:53:01-0:53:03</a>:</strong>  had a sentience to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:03">0:53:03-0:53:08</a>:</strong>  And I've told this story before, but I keep coming back to this idea that we aren't putting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:08">0:53:08-0:53:13</a>:</strong>  enough attention and respect into the actual garments, that they're protecting us, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:13">0:53:13-0:53:19</a>:</strong>  they're keeping us warm and in comfortable environments, that we can have these social<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:19">0:53:19-0:53:21</a>:</strong>  engagements without being unclothed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:21">0:53:21-0:53:27</a>:</strong>  I mean, these fundamental, they seem like laughable realities, but really textile is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:27">0:53:27-0:53:28</a>:</strong>  shelter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:28">0:53:28-0:53:34</a>:</strong>  And so I think part of it is just if everyone kind of thanks their clothing, like a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:34">0:53:34-0:53:40</a>:</strong>  gratitude for the service that the clothing offers, I think that's the indigenous heartbeat,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:40">0:53:40-0:53:44</a>:</strong>  you know, start with gratitude, start with thanks for whatever clothing you have, regardless<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:44">0:53:44-0:53:49</a>:</strong>  of its fiber content and work to keep it in play.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:49">0:53:49-0:53:55</a>:</strong>  And then from there, if you buy new or secondhand, you know, look even in the secondhand market,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:53:55">0:53:55-0:54:00</a>:</strong>  look for clothing that's a hundred percent natural so that those fibers, you know, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:00">0:54:00-0:54:08</a>:</strong>  more used plastic garment is, the more it fragments those fibers into the ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:08">0:54:08-0:54:14</a>:</strong>  So even when you're buying secondhand, look for natural, if you can foster clothing swaps<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:14">0:54:14-0:54:16</a>:</strong>  in your community to keep clothing in play.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:16">0:54:16-0:54:21</a>:</strong>  And then lastly, if you buy new and you have that opportunity and privilege, then look<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:21">0:54:21-0:54:25</a>:</strong>  for people you can support in your home community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:25">0:54:25-0:54:29</a>:</strong>  And if you can't support people in your home community or brands that are somewhat local<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:29">0:54:29-0:54:34</a>:</strong>  and transparent to you, and you have to go to the certification body, I mean, definitely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:34">0:54:34-0:54:38</a>:</strong>  it's helpful to look for an organic certification.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:38">0:54:38-0:54:42</a>:</strong>  I'm not going to say that that's not helpful, but GOTS, global organic trade certification,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:42">0:54:42-0:54:47</a>:</strong>  there's, you know, it's better than, it's the best we have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:47">0:54:47-0:54:50</a>:</strong>  So we'll just go with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:50">0:54:50-0:54:57</a>:</strong>  And we have a lot of work to do on certifications and transparency as a whole, but those would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:57">0:54:57-0:54:58</a>:</strong>  be my recommends.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:58">0:54:58-0:54:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:54:59">0:54:59-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  And I will echo most of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:07</a>:</strong>  I think, I think what fashion offers is that really the possibility that everybody can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:07">0:55:07-0:55:13</a>:</strong>  get engaged in moving the needle because we all wear clothes, you know, as far as I know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:13">0:55:13-0:55:19</a>:</strong>  So it's, it's really about, I think first reconnecting because often, you know, we,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:19">0:55:19-0:55:21</a>:</strong>  we think of, Oh, I'll just buy better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:21">0:55:21-0:55:25</a>:</strong>  No, but yeah, it's not about buying, but like first reconnecting with our wardrobe, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:25">0:55:25-0:55:30</a>:</strong>  we have at home, there is a really cool organization.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:30">0:55:30-0:55:39</a>:</strong>  They are actually like a student collective who prepared like a wardrobe audit tool that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:39">0:55:39-0:55:41</a>:</strong>  is called like closed mass index.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:41">0:55:41-0:55:46</a>:</strong>  And it is real templates that you sit with in front of your wardrobe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:46">0:55:46-0:55:51</a>:</strong>  And you really try to understand what's in there, you know, and like understand the journeys<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:51">0:55:51-0:55:55</a>:</strong>  behind the products and you take the labels and you understand what they are made of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:55">0:55:55-0:55:57</a>:</strong>  And you understand where they were made of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:55:57">0:55:57-0:56:03</a>:</strong>  And I went through that actually not so long ago, and it was such an empowering thing because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:03">0:56:03-0:56:06</a>:</strong>  he gave me a lot of information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:06">0:56:06-0:56:10</a>:</strong>  Most of it's pretty unpleasant about what was sitting in my wardrobe, but also it really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:10">0:56:10-0:56:16</a>:</strong>  recommitted me to, to just honoring my clothes and keeping them in use for as long as possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:16">0:56:16-0:56:22</a>:</strong>  And it also taught me what is it that is in my wardrobe that is actually really damaging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:22">0:56:22-0:56:27</a>:</strong>  because it's, you know, it's synthetic fibers and I need to be careful about how I wash<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:27">0:56:27-0:56:28</a>:</strong>  them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:28">0:56:28-0:56:32</a>:</strong>  And I need to be careful about how I dispose of them because they are effectively, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:32">0:56:32-0:56:34</a>:</strong>  know, like shedding microfibers forever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:34">0:56:34-0:56:39</a>:</strong>  So I think understanding our clothes help us understand how to take care of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:39">0:56:39-0:56:43</a>:</strong>  So we can minimize the impact that they're having on the environment now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:43">0:56:43-0:56:48</a>:</strong>  And also it can extend their life cycle, you know, and I think it's very beautiful to start<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:48">0:56:48-0:56:52</a>:</strong>  learning again, understand, because many of us don't know, you know, like how, how, how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:52">0:56:52-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  to wash your clothes, you know, in the best way to really extend their life and minimize<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:56:58</a>:</strong>  the impact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:56:58">0:56:58-0:57:04</a>:</strong>  So I think it's first connecting with what you have at home and then really looking to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:04">0:57:04-0:57:08</a>:</strong>  different ways of interacting with this industry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:08">0:57:08-0:57:14</a>:</strong>  So avoiding to buy new products as much as possible, which really should be always like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:14">0:57:14-0:57:19</a>:</strong>  I own a fashion brand, but I don't buy new clothes since like three years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:19">0:57:19-0:57:26</a>:</strong>  But like when, and when you want to buy something new, really vote with your dollar, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:26">0:57:26-0:57:32</a>:</strong>  like a vote and, and go with brands that align with your values.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:32">0:57:32-0:57:36</a>:</strong>  And I think there's something really powerful about like, I don't know, connecting our,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:36">0:57:36-0:57:42</a>:</strong>  our, our values with sort of correcting our actions with our values.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:42">0:57:42-0:57:45</a>:</strong>  And it's quite empowering to know, like, you know, I've supported this brand that, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:45">0:57:45-0:57:47</a>:</strong>  I think is very cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:47">0:57:47-0:57:50</a>:</strong>  And now I have a piece that represents these.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:50">0:57:50-0:57:52</a>:</strong>  It's like building a collection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:52">0:57:52-0:57:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah, of stories, you know?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:55">0:57:55-0:57:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:56">0:57:56-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  A great set of stories and memories and meaning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:01">0:58:01-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  It seems like with all these purchases and these decisions, you are building a collection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:09</a>:</strong>  It's a matter of what kind of collection do you want to build?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:09">0:58:09-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  And what does that collection represent?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:15</a>:</strong>  What does it say about you and your priorities and what you invest in?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:15">0:58:15-0:58:22</a>:</strong>  Because as we covered in just a small part here, there are effects to all of these decisions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:22">0:58:22-0:58:25</a>:</strong>  at many, many stages of the process before it gets to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:25">0:58:25-0:58:32</a>:</strong>  And certainly before it goes on to decompose or, you know, an afterlife on its own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:32">0:58:32-0:58:35</a>:</strong>  Now let's hand things over.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:35">0:58:35-0:58:40</a>:</strong>  Sorry, no, one last thing that I wanted to mention is also, and it really depends on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:40">0:58:40-0:58:44</a>:</strong>  how much we each want to get engaged, but you know, my journey is that I started going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:44">0:58:44-0:58:46</a>:</strong>  down the tunnel and I ended up here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:46">0:58:46-0:58:51</a>:</strong>  So you know, like there's always like when we want to go the extra step, there are so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:51">0:58:51-0:58:56</a>:</strong>  many options to really demand transparency and demand change from brands.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:56">0:58:56-0:58:58</a>:</strong>  And I do think that makes a big difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:58:58">0:58:58-0:59:03</a>:</strong>  So for example, Fashion Revolution on their website has a template where it just takes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:03">0:59:03-0:59:09</a>:</strong>  you two seconds to go pick your brand and it sends them an email saying like, I want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:09">0:59:09-0:59:12</a>:</strong>  to know who made my clothes, you know, and like what's behind my clothes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:12">0:59:12-0:59:17</a>:</strong>  And I think like the more that brands get these requests from customers or potential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:17">0:59:17-0:59:23</a>:</strong>  customers, the more they will understand that really, you know, their model needs to change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:23">0:59:23-0:59:27</a>:</strong>  And you know, there is a template for that, but there's always, you know, the possibility<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:27">0:59:27-0:59:32</a>:</strong>  of emailing a brand and being like, listen, I really like this piece, but I want to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:32">0:59:32-0:59:34</a>:</strong>  what's made of or where was it made.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:34">0:59:34-0:59:40</a>:</strong>  And yeah, and I think that's cool as consumers that we take that extra step.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:40">0:59:40-0:59:41</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:46">0:59:46-0:59:47</a>:</strong>  the listeners.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=0:59:47">0:59:47-0:59:50</a>:</strong>  And before we go to them, I'd also like to encourage our participants to check out the<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:01">1:00:01-1:00:05</a>:</strong>  along with the weekly episodes that I publish, our expert panel discussions will come out<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:31</a>:</strong>  notes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:31">1:00:31-1:00:35</a>:</strong>  Thanks again to our two panelists, Rebecca Burgess and Aroha Alvarez Fernandez.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:35">1:00:35-1:00:39</a>:</strong>  We're both working tirelessly to create a healthier and more equitable fashion and textile<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:39">1:00:39-1:00:41</a>:</strong>  industry around the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:41">1:00:41-1:00:44</a>:</strong>  I highly recommend that you check out their work.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:51">1:00:51-1:00:55</a>:</strong>  And a special thank you to the team at Climate Farmers for organizing the event and to all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:55">1:00:55-1:00:59</a>:</strong>  the wonderful people who showed up and participated in the chat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:00:59">1:00:59-1:01:03</a>:</strong>  Now as great as it is to include multiple experience perspectives on the topics that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:03">1:01:03-1:01:07</a>:</strong>  we covered in this panel, it's impossible to include the full range of opinions and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:07">1:01:07-1:01:09</a>:</strong>  viewpoints that are out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:09">1:01:09-1:01:13</a>:</strong>  And that's why I'm inviting you to join the growing community building regenerative skills<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:13">1:01:13-1:01:15</a>:</strong>  to use in their daily lives.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:15">1:01:15-1:01:20</a>:</strong>  It will always be free to join, all you have to do is follow the links to our Discord on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:20">1:01:20-1:01:23</a>:</strong>  the homepage of the Regenerative Skills website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:23">1:01:23-1:01:27</a>:</strong>  The benefit of joining through our Discord channel is that unlike social media platforms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:27">1:01:27-1:01:31</a>:</strong>  that mine your personal data and manipulate your feeds based on algorithms to sell you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:31">1:01:31-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  more junk, I founded these channels purely for knowledge, skill, and story exchange between<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:37">1:01:37-1:01:40</a>:</strong>  people who care to make their worlds better for everyone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:40">1:01:40-1:01:45</a>:</strong>  Now this week's question, which we'll be discussing on the forum is, do you know of any<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:45">1:01:45-1:01:48</a>:</strong>  textile producers in your own local area?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:48">1:01:48-1:01:52</a>:</strong>  And where do they source their material and sell their products?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:52">1:01:52-1:01:57</a>:</strong>  In my area for example around Barcelona, this area actually has quite a long textile manufacturing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:57">1:01:57-1:01:58</a>:</strong>  history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:01:58">1:01:58-1:02:03</a>:</strong>  Throughout the 1800s and the turn of the century, there were factories that were key economies<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:03">1:02:03-1:02:05</a>:</strong>  for many communities in Catalonia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:05">1:02:05-1:02:10</a>:</strong>  In my own town of Santa Laulle de Ronsana, the local community center is actually a renovated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:10">1:02:10-1:02:14</a>:</strong>  old textile factory that was shut down in the 60s, which is why it's still called<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:14">1:02:14-1:02:16</a>:</strong>  La Fabrica.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:16">1:02:16-1:02:21</a>:</strong>  I'm still learning about materials and techniques that are traditional to this area, but it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:21">1:02:21-1:02:25</a>:</strong>  a great window into the history of land use and industries for this part of Spain where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:25">1:02:25-1:02:26</a>:</strong>  I live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:26">1:02:26-1:02:30</a>:</strong>  There are so many ways to positively affect the production and consumption systems that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:30">1:02:30-1:02:34</a>:</strong>  we participate in, and I can't wait to hear about what the fiber and fashion cultures<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:34">1:02:34-1:02:37</a>:</strong>  of your own area are like.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:37">1:02:37-1:02:40</a>:</strong>  So don't forget you can also help to guide the panel discussions that I've got planned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:40">1:02:40-1:02:44</a>:</strong>  for the future by suggesting topics and guests in the forum as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:44">1:02:44-1:02:49</a>:</strong>  Well that's our show this week, until next time keep taking those little steps every<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/exploring-regenerative-fashion-expert-panel-3/#t=1:02:49">1:02:49-1:03:06</a>:</strong>  day towards a regenerative future, and I'll be right by your side along the way.  </p>
