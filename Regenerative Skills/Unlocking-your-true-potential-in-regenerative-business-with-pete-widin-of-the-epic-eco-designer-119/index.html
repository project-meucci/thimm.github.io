<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:13">0:00:13-0:00:17</a>:</strong>  Here we dive deep into the diverse worlds of regenerative living, permaculture, and<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:22">0:00:22-0:00:25</a>:</strong>  for your community, and for this beautiful planet that we share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:25">0:00:25-0:00:29</a>:</strong>  As always, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher, and I'm thrilled to guide you through this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:29">0:00:29-0:00:33</a>:</strong>  week's episode, so let's jump right in!<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:00:59">0:00:59-0:01:07</a>:</strong>  Alright everybody, before I get started with today's episode, I wanted to let you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:07">0:01:07-0:01:10</a>:</strong>  about a new project that I've just launched.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:10">0:01:10-0:01:14</a>:</strong>  After years of highlighting and promoting the knowledge, wisdom, and projects of innovators<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:14">0:01:14-0:01:18</a>:</strong>  and leaders in regenerative living through this podcast, I've realized that this audio<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:18">0:01:18-0:01:21</a>:</strong>  format can only ever reach so many people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:21">0:01:21-0:01:25</a>:</strong>  There are so many others out there who engage more with other forms of learning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:25">0:01:25-0:01:28</a>:</strong>  That's why I've started the Abundant Edge YouTube channel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:28">0:01:28-0:01:32</a>:</strong>  Now that I'm back on the road and visiting regenerative and sustainable projects in my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:32">0:01:32-0:01:36</a>:</strong>  travels, I'll be profiling the people and organizations that are making a real impact<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:36">0:01:36-0:01:39</a>:</strong>  on their environments and their communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:39">0:01:39-0:01:42</a>:</strong>  My goal is to show as many people as I can reach that you don't have to have a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:42">0:01:42-0:01:47</a>:</strong>  of money, access to a ton of resources, or have a fancy education under your belt to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:47">0:01:47-0:01:50</a>:</strong>  make a real difference in this world and create change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:50">0:01:50-0:01:55</a>:</strong>  My first mini-documentary highlights the unbelievable achievements of a small community called Kishaya<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:55">0:01:55-0:01:58</a>:</strong>  in the highlands of Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:01:58">0:01:58-0:02:01</a>:</strong>  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:01">0:02:01-0:02:06</a>:</strong>  owner who kept the ecosystem under monoculture cultivation and exploited the local people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:06">0:02:06-0:02:09</a>:</strong>  who worked for slave wages on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:09">0:02:09-0:02:13</a>:</strong>  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:13">0:02:13-0:02:16</a>:</strong>  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:16">0:02:16-0:02:21</a>:</strong>  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:21">0:02:21-0:02:25</a>:</strong>  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:25">0:02:25-0:02:28</a>:</strong>  it and create a better life for their families.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:28">0:02:28-0:02:32</a>:</strong>  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:32">0:02:32-0:02:36</a>:</strong>  a profound abundance which you'll see in the documentary.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:36">0:02:36-0:02:38</a>:</strong>  Now if you want to see the rest, you'll have to check it out for yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:38">0:02:38-0:02:43</a>:</strong>  You can find it really easily just by typing in abundant edge into the YouTube search bar,<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:47">0:02:47-0:02:49</a>:</strong>  as I travel through Mexico and beyond.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:02:49">0:02:49-0:02:53</a>:</strong>  I'll also be releasing tutorials on everything from design theory to building and gardening<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:05">0:03:05-0:03:09</a>:</strong>  As I continue to explore the myriad options that exist for profitable regenerative work,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:09">0:03:09-0:03:14</a>:</strong>  I keep coming back to the business aspects of impact and integrity entrepreneurship.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:14">0:03:14-0:03:18</a>:</strong>  Now one of the people that I've come to rely on for professional perspectives in this sphere<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:22">0:03:22-0:03:25</a>:</strong>  And I had the chance to catch up with him for today's session where we explore many<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:25">0:03:25-0:03:31</a>:</strong>  aspects of the personal and external challenges of finding holistic success in an ecological<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:32">0:03:32-0:03:36</a>:</strong>  Now in this interview with Pete, we break down some of the challenges that we both faced<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:36">0:03:36-0:03:40</a>:</strong>  in getting our design and consulting businesses off the ground, and some of the most important<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:40">0:03:40-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  takeaways that we learned from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:45</a>:</strong>  Pete talks about the common challenges that he sees from the people that he coaches, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:45">0:03:45-0:03:50</a>:</strong>  stresses the importance of doing the inner work to understand how you want to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:50">0:03:50-0:03:55</a>:</strong>  He also shares some tips on marketing strategies to help attract your ideal clients and reach<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:55">0:03:55-0:03:56</a>:</strong>  a larger audience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:04:01</a>:</strong>  Now as we'll repeat a few times in this session, a lot of Pete's advice applies to any business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:04</a>:</strong>  type and not just ecological designers and consultants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:08</a>:</strong>  So I'm sure nearly all of you will get some value out of this one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:08">0:04:08-0:04:11</a>:</strong>  So now I'll turn things over to Pete.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:11">0:04:11-0:04:13</a>:</strong>  Hey Pete, it's such a pleasure to be talking to you again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:13">0:04:13-0:04:14</a>:</strong>  How are you doing buddy?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:14">0:04:14-0:04:16</a>:</strong>  I am doing so great Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:16">0:04:16-0:04:20</a>:</strong>  It is almost July here in Minnesota.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:20">0:04:20-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  Just had an excellent design meeting with some nearby clients and loving life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:26</a>:</strong>  Great to be here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:26">0:04:26-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  You and I have been in touch through a lot of the different transitions that I've had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:30">0:04:30-0:04:34</a>:</strong>  between Guatemala and here, and I'm actually going to be coming out to Minnesota pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:34">0:04:34-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  soon and we're going to get picked up in person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:38</a>:</strong>  Yes, I am stoked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:38">0:04:38-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  A friend of mine is giving me a canoe very soon too, so I'll probably get out on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:04:45</a>:</strong>  Get on the lakes, yeah for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:45">0:04:45-0:04:49</a>:</strong>  Now I know you've had a whole bunch of things going on, not the least of which developing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:49">0:04:49-0:04:55</a>:</strong>  a project with your band, working with the Epic Eco Designer program, with other ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:04:55">0:04:55-0:05:00</a>:</strong>  designers in your area, and even some of your own design clients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:00">0:05:00-0:05:01</a>:</strong>  So what are we today?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:01">0:05:01-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  Just get into the questions since we did a previous interview, it was more than a year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:10</a>:</strong>  ago now, and if anybody's interested in learning about your personal background, I'll put a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:10">0:05:10-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  link to that episode in the show notes on this and they can find out about how you got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:15</a>:</strong>  started and what you do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:15">0:05:15-0:05:16</a>:</strong>  Perfect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:16">0:05:16-0:05:22</a>:</strong>  Alright cool, so let's start to explore a little bit about what you've seen in the potential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:22">0:05:22-0:05:28</a>:</strong>  for environmental regenerative work to be lucrative, how people can form businesses<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:28">0:05:28-0:05:29</a>:</strong>  around this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:29">0:05:29-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  What have you seen for yourself in this regard?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:31">0:05:31-0:05:38</a>:</strong>  Well it was interesting, and I won't get too much into my backstory, but shortening that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:38">0:05:38-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  up, I had a lot of experiences working in other people's businesses and in my own, where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:52</a>:</strong>  I just felt so short-handed in terms of understanding how to really see myself as the true expert<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:52">0:05:52-0:05:54</a>:</strong>  and specialist that I am.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:54">0:05:54-0:05:59</a>:</strong>  As an ecological designer, I personally have a background in ecology and landscape architecture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:05:59">0:05:59-0:06:05</a>:</strong>  and I've been focusing on residential design and now moving more into agricultural, larger<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:05">0:06:05-0:06:10</a>:</strong>  scale educational centers, retreat centers, things like that in the Midwest here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:10">0:06:10-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  But for so long, I kept myself from diving into my own business and I just kept helping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:25</a>:</strong>  people with theirs because I was feeling absolutely lost as far as how to find potential clients<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:25">0:06:25-0:06:31</a>:</strong>  who really wanted this type of work, this specialized type of design, how to have a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:31">0:06:31-0:06:39</a>:</strong>  conversation and feel natural about money with them, and also getting out of this feeling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:39">0:06:39-0:06:48</a>:</strong>  that I had to somehow undercut my prices in order to be appealing just for someone to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:48">0:06:48-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  hire me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  And so how does that fly in the face of some of the things that you've learned since then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:54">0:06:54-0:06:58</a>:</strong>  that have helped to build your confidence and helped you also to build the confidence<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:06:58">0:06:58-0:07:02</a>:</strong>  of other people you've worked with into the realities of what the potential is when you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:02">0:07:02-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  kind of either break off on your own or realize the power that you have within this knowledge<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:09</a>:</strong>  base?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:09">0:07:09-0:07:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and there's a couple sides to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:11">0:07:11-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  The first one that is a little bit harder to put a pin in is this aspect of self-worth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:27</a>:</strong>  And it's definitely contextual as far as our individual way that that manifests.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:27">0:07:27-0:07:35</a>:</strong>  But so many people, just in general, designer or not, we have this kind of skewed view of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:35">0:07:35-0:07:43</a>:</strong>  ourselves in terms of the true value, true worth of just us as people in general, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:43">0:07:43-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  realizing that we don't have to be something external from ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:07:55</a>:</strong>  And we can be authentic and relaxed and really be in our own flow and be making a great living<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:55">0:07:55-0:07:57</a>:</strong>  as a designer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:07:57">0:07:57-0:08:03</a>:</strong>  And another, so it's like, we don't have to somehow extend ourselves beyond who we truly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:03">0:08:03-0:08:04</a>:</strong>  are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:13</a>:</strong>  We can become some weird idea of the all powerful Oliver in order to be this designer with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:13">0:08:13-0:08:16</a>:</strong>  lucrative business who's doing really valuable work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:16">0:08:16-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  Sure, it's that jumping past self-doubt and into becoming an egomaniac.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:23</a>:</strong>  There's a better balance in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:23">0:08:23-0:08:28</a>:</strong>  Tell me how this realization has helped you in your own life and your own business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:34</a>:</strong>  One aspect of it, which is the other piece that I had mentioned, I alluded to, is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:34">0:08:34-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  this work, there's so much benefit to what we do for people, for the planet and the results<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:48</a>:</strong>  that we can get people with a permaculture, ecological hybrid approach, whatever your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:48">0:08:48-0:08:52</a>:</strong>  specific approach is, is we're all so unique.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:52">0:08:52-0:08:58</a>:</strong>  It's so pragmatic, it's so functional and it can be beautiful as well, of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:08:58">0:08:58-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  So I actually found that it's easier to sell that type of work because of the added benefit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:06</a>:</strong>  and it's because of the depth of value there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:06">0:09:06-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  And really, I was thinking about it on my drive to this design meeting today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:15</a>:</strong>  Even I have done hundreds of these meetings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:15">0:09:15-0:09:17</a>:</strong>  Sometimes I still get nervous before them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:17">0:09:17-0:09:19</a>:</strong>  It's natural.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:19">0:09:19-0:09:24</a>:</strong>  But at the same time, that's really just because I care and I want to make sure that the client<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:27</a>:</strong>  feels supported.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:27">0:09:27-0:09:32</a>:</strong>  I have this client-centric perspective on my business, which is so important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:32">0:09:32-0:09:38</a>:</strong>  And that really takes a lot of the issues of self-worth out because the issues of, do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:38">0:09:38-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  I know enough, am I good enough, etc., it's like none of that really matters when you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:45">0:09:45-0:09:51</a>:</strong>  looking at it from a perspective of how can I help this person and that you are a guide<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:51">0:09:51-0:09:56</a>:</strong>  who sees possibility and potential and acts upon that rather than having to be some kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:56">0:09:56-0:09:58</a>:</strong>  of walking encyclopedia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:09:58">0:09:58-0:10:05</a>:</strong>  Because a walking encyclopedia actually throws people off in my experience rather than them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:05">0:10:05-0:10:08</a>:</strong>  trusting you because they're like, oh, that person knows everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:08">0:10:08-0:10:17</a>:</strong>  It's not a natural state to be in as a human, as an organism.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:17">0:10:17-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  Infectious curiosity is really what wins the day at all times in a sales conversation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:23</a>:</strong>  in a design meeting, or whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:23">0:10:23-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  So that really solved the self-worth piece for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:33</a>:</strong>  And as far as value-based pricing, which is what I teach people that I work with on their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:33">0:10:33-0:10:38</a>:</strong>  business, a lot of that has to do with our sense of self-worth as a designer, but as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:38">0:10:38-0:10:43</a>:</strong>  a person in the rest of our lives, too, because the business is only a third of who we are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:48</a>:</strong>  We have our relationships to ourself, our relationship to others in our personal life<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:48">0:10:48-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:10:53</a>:</strong>  So really all of that is affected by our sense of self-worth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:53">0:10:53-0:10:56</a>:</strong>  And so one of the things that I've always found that you've been uniquely good at is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:10:56">0:10:56-0:11:03</a>:</strong>  communicating this sort of added value of the services of ecological design over conventional<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:03">0:11:03-0:11:05</a>:</strong>  landscaping and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:05">0:11:05-0:11:11</a>:</strong>  Tell me a little bit about how you convey that message to people to help them to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:11">0:11:11-0:11:17</a>:</strong>  all of the benefits that sort of a holistic approach to their natural systems can bring<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:17">0:11:17-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  and how it's sort of related to finding clients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:21">0:11:21-0:11:22</a>:</strong>  OK.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:24</a>:</strong>  So I'll just give you a couple layers there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:24">0:11:24-0:11:34</a>:</strong>  So as far as finding clients, that one is definitely specific to each business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:34">0:11:34-0:11:41</a>:</strong>  It relates to how best we communicate with others, what types of settings we like to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:44</a>:</strong>  be in, what our real clientele focus is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  For example, if you're focusing on consulting with farmers on soil health or if you're working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:11:52</a>:</strong>  on getting residential clients, you're going to be in different settings and interacting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:52">0:11:52-0:11:55</a>:</strong>  with people in different ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:12:01</a>:</strong>  Ultimately, regardless of who you're working with when it comes to lead generation, creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:01">0:12:01-0:12:07</a>:</strong>  relationships with people, sales, it's really just about understanding what their top of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:07">0:12:07-0:12:08</a>:</strong>  mind problem is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:08">0:12:08-0:12:16</a>:</strong>  And that's such a ubiquitous recommendation in any industry, any business, but because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:16">0:12:16-0:12:18</a>:</strong>  it's true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:18">0:12:18-0:12:25</a>:</strong>  And so as part of that client-centric approach, it's really about being just inquisitive and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:25">0:12:25-0:12:34</a>:</strong>  by nature of being an ecological designer, farmer, whatever we may be doing that we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:34">0:12:34-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  using our experience to be consulting for others and help them shorten the gap between<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:43</a>:</strong>  where they're at and where they want to be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:43">0:12:43-0:12:48</a>:</strong>  It's really understanding not only where they want to be, because that's pretty easy for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:48">0:12:48-0:12:50</a>:</strong>  people to talk about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:50">0:12:50-0:12:51</a>:</strong>  What's the vision?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:51">0:12:51-0:12:55</a>:</strong>  Of course, some people don't have a vision and are looking to a consultant to help them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:12:55">0:12:55-0:13:03</a>:</strong>  there, but it's really about understanding where that person is today and why they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:03">0:13:03-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  there, what the inner workings are of their life, their mind, their relationship to their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:15</a>:</strong>  property in this example, that's going to help us really understand what the value would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:15">0:13:15-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  be if we were to help them address those issues from our perspective and from that bird's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:23</a>:</strong>  eye perspective on their situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:23">0:13:23-0:13:27</a>:</strong>  Well, talk to me a little bit about how you get in that deep with a client or someone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:27">0:13:27-0:13:33</a>:</strong>  that you're collaborating with to sort of suss out these things that many of us either<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:33">0:13:33-0:13:39</a>:</strong>  don't know how to talk about or are unaware of about the things that are holding us back,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:39">0:13:39-0:13:46</a>:</strong>  the problems that are more at the or below the surface that are perhaps causing the problems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:46">0:13:46-0:13:54</a>:</strong>  with the hang ups or any of those other issues for what it is we say that we're trying to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:54">0:13:54-0:13:55</a>:</strong>  achieve.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:55">0:13:55-0:13:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:56">0:13:56-0:13:59</a>:</strong>  And you made a really good observation there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:13:59">0:13:59-0:14:05</a>:</strong>  Below the surface is key because in so much of life, I just had a very short conversation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:05">0:14:05-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  with my neighbor and I was like, it made me a little bit restless and it was a really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  good nice little exchange, but I was just like, hey, how's it going?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:18</a>:</strong>  And they're like, hey, good, you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:18">0:14:18-0:14:21</a>:</strong>  And then we talked about the weather and it's like, that's nice to make that connection,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:21">0:14:21-0:14:28</a>:</strong>  but it's so surface level and I was the instigator of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:28">0:14:28-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  Getting below the surface with people is not something we commonly do, especially with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:41</a>:</strong>  people we've just met, but it is the one thing that's going to build trust most quickly with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:41">0:14:41-0:14:42</a>:</strong>  somebody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:42">0:14:42-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  One, because you're breaking through that initial barrier that so many people feel they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  need to uphold around strangers or in public or whatnot, people don't actually want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:14:57</a>:</strong>  be that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:57">0:14:57-0:14:58</a>:</strong>  They want connection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:14:58">0:14:58-0:15:03</a>:</strong>  And in order to make that comfortable for people, they really have to know that you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:03">0:15:03-0:15:05</a>:</strong>  looking out for their best interests.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:05">0:15:05-0:15:11</a>:</strong>  And showing somebody that you are looking out for their best interests is about being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:11">0:15:11-0:15:16</a>:</strong>  inquisitive rather than being the person who's telling, telling, telling, telling, telling,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:16">0:15:16-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  telling, telling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:21</a>:</strong>  Like I get sold to all the time where people are like telling me, oh, this will be good<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:21">0:15:21-0:15:25</a>:</strong>  for your business or whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:25">0:15:25-0:15:30</a>:</strong>  If they're coming at me from the perspective of telling me everything they can do, I know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:30">0:15:30-0:15:34</a>:</strong>  that right off the bat, it's not going to be something I'm interested in at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:34">0:15:34-0:15:40</a>:</strong>  And I think honestly, that's where a lot of consultants lose potential sales, is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:40">0:15:40-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  the person on the other end of that conversation, the person receiving your spiel or whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  you're doing, they may not think about it consciously unless they're in sales and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:15:56</a>:</strong>  understand these nuanced differences to interacting with people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:15:56">0:15:56-0:16:03</a>:</strong>  But if you come at it from a point of wanting to understand and in that sense, digging deeper<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:03">0:16:03-0:16:08</a>:</strong>  into the things they're talking about, finding clarity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:08">0:16:08-0:16:12</a>:</strong>  Because someone could say, oh, well, I'm having a lot of issues with my yard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:12">0:16:12-0:16:17</a>:</strong>  There's like really bad drainage and other stuff going on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:17">0:16:17-0:16:23</a>:</strong>  You know, some consultants might just write down, oh, poor drainage, we need to fix that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:23">0:16:23-0:16:24</a>:</strong>  What's that causing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:24">0:16:24-0:16:25</a>:</strong>  What's that causing in their landscape?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:25">0:16:25-0:16:29</a>:</strong>  What kind of issues is it causing in the rest of their life?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:29">0:16:29-0:16:35</a>:</strong>  Do they want to have outdoor barbecues and they can't because it's too muddy to put chairs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:35">0:16:35-0:16:36</a>:</strong>  out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:36">0:16:36-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  It's these very specific contextual aspects of how someone's current situation is affecting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  them that results in being able to communicate the value of you stepping in and helping them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:48</a>:</strong>  out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:48">0:16:48-0:16:54</a>:</strong>  Now, I find in my own interactions with clients like this, usually asking why a few times<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:16:54">0:16:54-0:17:01</a>:</strong>  will get down into sort of the more base level of what it is that's either causing the issue<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:01">0:17:01-0:17:07</a>:</strong>  or is the thing that they're wanting to achieve but are finding friction or blockages in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:07">0:17:07-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  way of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:14</a>:</strong>  But also coming at it from a perspective of offering up a little bit of personal vulnerability<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:14">0:17:14-0:17:19</a>:</strong>  or finding a way to relate whether you've had the same experience or just a similar<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:19">0:17:19-0:17:29</a>:</strong>  one or no one who has often gets them to explain or I guess sort of communicate the parts that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:29">0:17:29-0:17:34</a>:</strong>  they weren't planning on, but that are key to understanding what the real objective in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:34">0:17:34-0:17:36</a>:</strong>  any project is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:36">0:17:36-0:17:43</a>:</strong>  Have you got methods or maybe even design criteria or communication steps to sort of,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:43">0:17:43-0:17:47</a>:</strong>  I don't want to say fast track that because it's not always a race for time, but to sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:47">0:17:47-0:17:53</a>:</strong>  of systematize it so that it doesn't get overlooked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:53">0:17:53-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  Well I think a big part of that is it's just going through these conversations with people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  So there's a few different aspects, I mean just so many things that we're talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:12</a>:</strong>  But one of these pieces is that it takes experience and running through these conversations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:12">0:18:12-0:18:18</a>:</strong>  So like I said I've worked with hundreds of design clients and so I can sense when there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:18">0:18:18-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  something more that we could be talking about when I feel like there's not true stone at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:30</a>:</strong>  the bottom of the well clarity on what's really happening for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:30">0:18:30-0:18:37</a>:</strong>  As far as systematizing it, I think part of what you may be getting at is do I have some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:37">0:18:37-0:18:42</a>:</strong>  type of rubric I use to go through things with my clients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:42">0:18:42-0:18:50</a>:</strong>  As part of the United Designers family of professionals, I do take some of that lead<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:50">0:18:50-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  that Dan Halsey and others have put into Rubik for Understanding where someone's at and making<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:18:59</a>:</strong>  sure I'm covering different angles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:18:59">0:18:59-0:19:06</a>:</strong>  But at the same time I find that every client is so different that I at this point use my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:06">0:19:06-0:19:12</a>:</strong>  experience to guide me in terms of what I really need to know to make sure I'm putting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:12">0:19:12-0:19:17</a>:</strong>  together a proposal that's going to really convey that value to somebody and get them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:17">0:19:17-0:19:25</a>:</strong>  really excited from a piece of paper about a design and a transformation in real life<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:25">0:19:25-0:19:27</a>:</strong>  in their property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:27">0:19:27-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  So as far as creating a system around it, it's good to have an idea of the certain topics<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:38</a>:</strong>  you want to cover with somebody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:38">0:19:38-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  But as far as getting to the bottom of something, a huge piece for me was getting comfortable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:47</a>:</strong>  asking somebody why.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:47">0:19:47-0:19:52</a>:</strong>  I've never had somebody look at me and be like, no, I don't want to talk about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:52">0:19:52-0:19:53</a>:</strong>  Why are you keep asking why?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:53">0:19:53-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  Are you four years old?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:59</a>:</strong>  And you don't have to just say why, why, why, because that would be ridiculous, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:19:59">0:19:59-0:20:07</a>:</strong>  But if somebody says, well, I really wish we want to put a new patio in, but I don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:07">0:20:07-0:20:15</a>:</strong>  want to have it over here, I want to have it over there, rather than just investing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:15">0:20:15-0:20:19</a>:</strong>  in that level of the story and saying, okay, we'll put it over there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:19">0:20:19-0:20:21</a>:</strong>  How am I helping?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:21">0:20:21-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  Like yeah, maybe I might help by choosing materials in the shape or whatnot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:32</a>:</strong>  But where people really see the value in having you around as a consultant in any situation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:32">0:20:32-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  is when you are asking those mirroring questions that just keep bouncing that same topic, deeper<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:42</a>:</strong>  and deeper, it's like paddle ball and you're just getting farther and farther down that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:42">0:20:42-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  little canyon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:52</a>:</strong>  And then you can explore, you can get to the level of information that might tell you,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:52">0:20:52-0:20:59</a>:</strong>  well actually, well if you bring through lumber every so often to work on your furniture shop,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:20:59">0:20:59-0:21:01</a>:</strong>  well maybe the patio shouldn't be there or whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:01">0:21:01-0:21:04</a>:</strong>  And they're like, oh wow, I didn't even think about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:04">0:21:04-0:21:11</a>:</strong>  And it's about getting that information so that you can have that bird's eye perspective<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:11">0:21:11-0:21:17</a>:</strong>  and give them the real evidence of the fact that you're thinking about things in a different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:17">0:21:17-0:21:19</a>:</strong>  way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:19">0:21:19-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  Because that's the only thing that ever ultimately sells a design, a consulting package of any<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:30</a>:</strong>  kind is, are you thinking in a different way from the client?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:30">0:21:30-0:21:37</a>:</strong>  Because just like Einstein said, like we always quote, a problem can't be solved at the same<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:37">0:21:37-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  level of consciousness that created it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:41</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:41">0:21:41-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  And so let's take a little shift right now away from just working directly with the clients<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:52</a>:</strong>  and start maybe a little bit further back from the beginning about how you project a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:21:52">0:21:52-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  message and start to add value to a conversation that would bring people to your services above<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:04</a>:</strong>  say a competitor or someone else in a similar field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:04">0:22:04-0:22:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:06">0:22:06-0:22:12</a>:</strong>  So what I work on with one-to-one clients that I help in their business, we're focused<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:12">0:22:12-0:22:14</a>:</strong>  on four things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:14">0:22:14-0:22:20</a>:</strong>  It's packaging their service, pricing it from a value perspective, marketing it and selling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:20">0:22:20-0:22:21</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:21">0:22:21-0:22:28</a>:</strong>  And in order to have a productive conversation or even know if someone is right for your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:28">0:22:28-0:22:33</a>:</strong>  service, you have to have that package clearly defined.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:36</a>:</strong>  So that I think is what exactly you offer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:36">0:22:36-0:22:41</a>:</strong>  You jump further on that is whether the client is right for the services that you, and again,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:41">0:22:41-0:22:46</a>:</strong>  this is one of the things that I've really gravitated towards in your message is you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:46">0:22:46-0:22:49</a>:</strong>  also need to be screening the people who come to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:49">0:22:49-0:22:55</a>:</strong>  And I mean, it can be very difficult to do, especially in the beginning of starting a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:22:55">0:22:55-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  business when you're still in a mindset of scarcity, thinking that you need to take every<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  single penny of business that comes your way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:12</a>:</strong>  But how do you get out of that mentality of thinking, okay, anything is going to be worth<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:12">0:23:12-0:23:13</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:13">0:23:13-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  And realizing that there's only a handful of clients that are really going to compensate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:22</a>:</strong>  you properly for your time and give you the types of projects that you are uniquely suited<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:22">0:23:22-0:23:29</a>:</strong>  to do well at, and even continue to grow the experience that you want to build towards<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:29">0:23:29-0:23:34</a>:</strong>  the consultancy or the design firm that you ultimately want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:34">0:23:34-0:23:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:35">0:23:35-0:23:41</a>:</strong>  And I want to start off by saying, I laugh about it now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:41">0:23:41-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  But when I was just starting, I was so mired in that scarcity mindset and that energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:23:50</a>:</strong>  Oh, so was I. Yeah, I can totally relate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:50">0:23:50-0:23:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:51">0:23:51-0:23:54</a>:</strong>  So with anyone who's just starting out, I feel that I've been there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:23:54">0:23:54-0:24:01</a>:</strong>  With anyone who's farther along in their business, there are different aspects to feeling like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:01">0:24:01-0:24:06</a>:</strong>  one is caught in a rut or whatever that are kind of warning flags that say, okay, let's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:06">0:24:06-0:24:12</a>:</strong>  take another look at this and analyze it with a fresh perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:12">0:24:12-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  But as far as this idea that one needs to take on whatever comes their way, that's just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:19">0:24:19-0:24:21</a>:</strong>  a symptom.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:21">0:24:21-0:24:23</a>:</strong>  It's not a necessity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:23">0:24:23-0:24:28</a>:</strong>  It's not a way of being that it's going to bring success or sustained growth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:28">0:24:28-0:24:32</a>:</strong>  For example, if somebody is taking on a lot of jobs that they don't like, they might stop<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:32">0:24:32-0:24:36</a>:</strong>  reaching out to new leads and making sales and then the business slows down and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:36">0:24:36-0:24:38</a>:</strong>  end up quitting or whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:38">0:24:38-0:24:43</a>:</strong>  Or they may not be able to take the leads that they really want because they're overcommitted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:43">0:24:43-0:24:46</a>:</strong>  to ones that are simply draining their time and resources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:46">0:24:46-0:24:47</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:47">0:24:47-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  And I say that as a hypothetical as if that wasn't exactly what I went through.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:53</a>:</strong>  A friend of mine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:24:53">0:24:53-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so having that package clearly defined, it's really the package results in a clear<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  offer of what exactly you do for somebody and what that entails and how each part of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  that package that you offer solves specific problems that they have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:19</a>:</strong>  Because this is the client centric approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:19">0:25:19-0:25:20</a>:</strong>  It's not all about us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:20">0:25:20-0:25:24</a>:</strong>  Every mindset comes from this warped perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:24">0:25:24-0:25:30</a>:</strong>  Unfortunately, it's so prevalent and we all deal with it in various ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  It's kind of like, I don't want to say it's like fear where it's always around.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:37</a>:</strong>  It just gets quieter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:37">0:25:37-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  But it's very pervasive in modern culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:39">0:25:39-0:25:47</a>:</strong>  And it's a big reason why so many people in the permaculture ecological design or other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:47">0:25:47-0:25:54</a>:</strong>  world changer, world healer modalities are really fed up with the idea of money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:25:54">0:25:54-0:26:00</a>:</strong>  It's something I come across all the time and it keeps us from being successful in this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:00">0:26:00-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  current economy and really making the change that we want to see happen and really soaring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:19</a>:</strong>  But as far as getting to a place where you're interacting with the people, at least on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:19">0:26:19-0:26:24</a>:</strong>  actual sales conversation level, once you get to that point with somebody, you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:24">0:26:24-0:26:28</a>:</strong>  that they're the right kind of person you want to work with before you even get to that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:28">0:26:28-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  site visit or get on a call with them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:37</a>:</strong>  You know that they're going to be a good fit if certain criteria are in place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:37">0:26:37-0:26:42</a>:</strong>  They're really serious about making the results happen now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:42">0:26:42-0:26:48</a>:</strong>  They're ready and willing to invest in what it takes to hire you as a consultant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:48">0:26:48-0:26:56</a>:</strong>  But like I said, those symptoms of feeling frenzied and that just any job would do right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:26:56">0:26:56-0:27:05</a>:</strong>  now, it doesn't take that long to sit down and look at, okay, what am I really offering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:05">0:27:05-0:27:08</a>:</strong>  here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:08">0:27:08-0:27:15</a>:</strong>  And then be able to shift your energy, shift your perspective to one of excitement for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:15">0:27:15-0:27:18</a>:</strong>  the people that you're going to help with this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:18">0:27:18-0:27:27</a>:</strong>  The biggest piece and I would say 90% of my personal work on my business is simply emotional,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  the self-worth, the ability to be radically honest with myself and say, this isn't working.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:43</a>:</strong>  So instead of frantically wasting time on Facebook or some weird flyer that someone's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:43">0:27:43-0:27:50</a>:</strong>  trying to sell me for marketing, I'm going to take two hours or whatever today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:50">0:27:50-0:27:57</a>:</strong>  Maybe I'll take five hours and go for an amazing hike, get in a really great place of mind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:27:57">0:27:57-0:28:01</a>:</strong>  And then spend a couple hours really taking an honest look, maybe with a friend, maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:01">0:28:01-0:28:06</a>:</strong>  with a mentor or whatever on what am I really doing here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:06">0:28:06-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  Because if you're moving forward from a place where there isn't that clarity, it's just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:16</a>:</strong>  a recipe for unnecessary failure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:16">0:28:16-0:28:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:17">0:28:17-0:28:21</a>:</strong>  And I mean, so much of what you've talked about is figuring out how to define not only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:21">0:28:21-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  what your services are, but what it is that you're good at before creating this message<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  and doing all of this client outreach or marketing or whatever it might be to try and grow your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:31">0:28:31-0:28:32</a>:</strong>  business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:32">0:28:32-0:28:35</a>:</strong>  Because if those things are poorly defined, your message isn't going to ring true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:35">0:28:35-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  Your marketing strategy isn't going to resonate with people or give them a false idea of what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:45</a>:</strong>  it is that you can offer them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:45">0:28:45-0:28:51</a>:</strong>  So once you kind of have clarified that, once you've done that sort of inner work to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:51">0:28:51-0:28:56</a>:</strong>  yourself and your services better, how do you start to put that out there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:28:56">0:28:56-0:29:01</a>:</strong>  What are the channels that you have found success in and that you have seen other people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:01">0:29:01-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  find success in as well?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:11</a>:</strong>  One of the biggest pieces of making an impact in any way today is breaking out of the normal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:11">0:29:11-0:29:18</a>:</strong>  channels that most people are using to connect with others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:18">0:29:18-0:29:24</a>:</strong>  So being on social media is great and having a great following on Instagram or your Facebook<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:24">0:29:24-0:29:27</a>:</strong>  page is cool for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:27">0:29:27-0:29:30</a>:</strong>  But those numbers don't mean anything if there aren't sales coming into the business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:30">0:29:30-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  They really don't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:38</a>:</strong>  You can have the most impressive Facebook page with 20,000 likes, but if you don't know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:38">0:29:38-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  why you're attracting those people, it's not going to make any difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:48</a>:</strong>  The same goes for in-person stuff and that's what I'm leading into is the fact that hands<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:48">0:29:48-0:29:57</a>:</strong>  down in-person interaction is the way to meet people, to make an impression, and make an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:29:57">0:29:57-0:30:00</a>:</strong>  impression as yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:00">0:30:00-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  You don't have to put on some weird business persona.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:07</a>:</strong>  People catch onto that so easily, even subconsciously.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:07">0:30:07-0:30:12</a>:</strong>  It's not authentic and anything that's inauthentic just turns people off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:12">0:30:12-0:30:17</a>:</strong>  I look at things in a very spiritual, kind of energy-centric way, but regardless, if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:17">0:30:17-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  it turns people off, it turns people off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  That means really time misspent and people not helped with your business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:31</a>:</strong>  Some of the biggest things that have helped for me were just getting involved with some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:31">0:30:31-0:30:36</a>:</strong>  local groups and especially educational groups.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:36">0:30:36-0:30:42</a>:</strong>  For example, I walked in randomly to a nature center and talked with this guy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:42">0:30:42-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  This is just an amazing story I have to share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:52</a>:</strong>  His wife passed away from cancer a few years ago and while she was battling for her life,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:30:52">0:30:52-0:31:00</a>:</strong>  he asked her, is it okay if we take the money that we're going to spend on vacations together<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:00">0:31:00-0:31:03</a>:</strong>  and build a nature center at this park?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:03">0:31:03-0:31:04</a>:</strong>  I should take you there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:04">0:31:04-0:31:07</a>:</strong>  I've been very involved with this place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:07">0:31:07-0:31:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah, what park is this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:08">0:31:08-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  This is Sunfish Lake Park in Lake Elmo, Minnesota.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:11">0:31:11-0:31:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I'd love to see it, but yeah, go on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:15">0:31:15-0:31:17</a>:</strong>  It's called Sally Munzer Nature Center.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:17">0:31:17-0:31:18</a>:</strong>  They have a website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:18">0:31:18-0:31:20</a>:</strong>  Oh my gosh, I could go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:20">0:31:20-0:31:25</a>:</strong>  We could spend a whole hour talking about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:25">0:31:25-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  I got invited to do various things such as run planting days of native prairie plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:32</a>:</strong>  with fourth graders.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:32">0:31:32-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  I got to choose all these crazy awesome unusual plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:38</a>:</strong>  The kids learned a ton about pollinators and fire ecology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:38">0:31:38-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  This is very, very fulfilling work for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  It's not the core of my business, but it's another aspect of creating diversified income<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:48</a>:</strong>  streams, which is important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:48">0:31:48-0:31:54</a>:</strong>  You can run a business solely on design work, and I do help people do that year round, even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:54">0:31:54-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  in the dead of winter having design work ongoing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:03</a>:</strong>  It's fun to have that diversity, and most people need that change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:03">0:32:03-0:32:10</a>:</strong>  When you're getting involved with organizations, while it can be an amazing way to meet people,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:10">0:32:10-0:32:17</a>:</strong>  show them your expertise by teaching rather than trying to make some inauthentic impression<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:17">0:32:17-0:32:22</a>:</strong>  in a quick conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:22">0:32:22-0:32:24</a>:</strong>  Meeting kids' families, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:24">0:32:24-0:32:26</a>:</strong>  I've gotten work that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:26">0:32:26-0:32:31</a>:</strong>  For example, kids go home and say, oh my god, we saved seeds from this tomato.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:31">0:32:31-0:32:35</a>:</strong>  Then lo and behold, I'm designing edible landscape for the family because the daughter's obsessed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:35">0:32:35-0:32:40</a>:</strong>  with saving seeds from everything including bananas, which of course most don't have seeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:40">0:32:40-0:32:43</a>:</strong>  That we get here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:43">0:32:43-0:32:49</a>:</strong>  An important aspect of this though, although it can be so effective, is to understand what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:49">0:32:49-0:32:52</a>:</strong>  your commitment level is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:32:54</a>:</strong>  I'm a very, very creative person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:32:54">0:32:54-0:33:02</a>:</strong>  I had resisted analytics, numbers, et cetera for so long in my business, and I'm really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:02">0:33:02-0:33:04</a>:</strong>  coming around to how powerful they are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:04">0:33:04-0:33:10</a>:</strong>  I'm bringing that more and more into the one-to-one work I do with business owners.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:10">0:33:10-0:33:18</a>:</strong>  How much time are you willing and able to spend doing this type of marketing where you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:18">0:33:18-0:33:22</a>:</strong>  building relationships with others, which is very important from a social permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:22">0:33:22-0:33:27</a>:</strong>  perspective, from a personal health perspective, and it's very effective for the bottom line<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:27">0:33:27-0:33:31</a>:</strong>  of the business when you know what you're offering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:31">0:33:31-0:33:39</a>:</strong>  If you're spending 20 hours a week volunteering at a school, is it really paying off in terms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:39">0:33:39-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  of the relationships that you're building turning into your work that's furthering your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:51</a>:</strong>  ability to do what you're here on this planet to do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:33:57</a>:</strong>  A big aspect of that though is that I've had an amazing relationship with this nature center<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:33:57">0:33:57-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  because they're paying me for some of the things I do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:02</a>:</strong>  I do volunteer some other ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:02">0:34:02-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  I'm going to be watering a three sisters garden this week because someone's out of town.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  I chip in in various ways, but if you're making decisions and committing to things with some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  vague idea and if it's vague, you can tell if it's not concrete.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:27</a>:</strong>  If you don't have a definitive, yes, this is the activity that's bringing in income<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:27">0:34:27-0:34:33</a>:</strong>  or yes, I am actually getting leads out of this and then having the skills to build those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:33">0:34:33-0:34:43</a>:</strong>  relationships and make sales, if that's really not set out clearly, and I come back to clarity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:43">0:34:43-0:34:50</a>:</strong>  all the time because it keeps us on a forward path, on an upward spiral.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:50">0:34:50-0:34:56</a>:</strong>  But yeah, if it's not clear why we're spending all this time hanging out and helping people,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:34:56">0:34:56-0:35:01</a>:</strong>  there has to be that exchange, that give and receive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:01">0:35:01-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  It's just universal law.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:02">0:35:02-0:35:08</a>:</strong>  It needs to be equal or else you're going to get burnt out or their expectations might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:08">0:35:08-0:35:11</a>:</strong>  not be met and you committed to something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:11">0:35:11-0:35:18</a>:</strong>  There's ways in which that energy can fall off of the proper channel if it's not clear<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:18">0:35:18-0:35:21</a>:</strong>  as to why it's being spent in a certain direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:21">0:35:21-0:35:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah, defining that's pretty key.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:23">0:35:23-0:35:27</a>:</strong>  A lot of what you've talked about seems to be going hand in hand with developing a holistic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:27">0:35:27-0:35:33</a>:</strong>  lifestyle that integrates you with the community and business clients and leads and those types<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:37</a>:</strong>  of client relationships are almost just a side effect of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:37">0:35:37-0:35:42</a>:</strong>  It has much more to do with building social capital and monetary capital is one of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:42">0:35:42-0:35:46</a>:</strong>  things that can come from that depending on how you manage it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:46">0:35:46-0:35:51</a>:</strong>  But let's talk about something that you touched on just a second ago is diversity of income.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:51">0:35:51-0:35:56</a>:</strong>  And like you said, it is possible to make a good living just through a design firm or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:35:56">0:35:56-0:36:02</a>:</strong>  consulting, but especially for people of our generation, the millennial generation, though<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:02">0:36:02-0:36:10</a>:</strong>  I'm kind of on the older end of it, they are looking into a different type of, let's say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:10">0:36:10-0:36:15</a>:</strong>  career resilience, whereas the previous model used to be work for a company that was large<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:15">0:36:15-0:36:19</a>:</strong>  enough to offer benefits and all of these things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:19">0:36:19-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  That option is becoming less and less secure for so many of us, especially those of us<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:28</a>:</strong>  who get into entrepreneurial endeavors and start to work for ourselves or do sort of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:28">0:36:28-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  freelance work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:37</a>:</strong>  What are some of the other options that you've seen aside from just ecological design consultancy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:37">0:36:37-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  and perhaps teaching workshops from time to time that are profitable endeavors with either<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:49</a>:</strong>  colleagues that you've worked with or that you've seen successful examples of in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:49">0:36:49-0:36:51</a>:</strong>  sphere in which we work?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:36:51">0:36:51-0:37:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah, really the biggest piece that it comes down to is cultivating the awareness of our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:01">0:37:01-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  own innate gifts and what we love to do and being aware of opportunities to apply those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:11</a>:</strong>  in various ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:11">0:37:11-0:37:18</a>:</strong>  So there's a lot of different ways in which people might be involved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:18">0:37:18-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  From an entrepreneurial perspective, it's a little bit different than say an ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:26">0:37:26-0:37:36</a>:</strong>  designer could easily become a fundraising donor relations manager for a land conservancy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:36">0:37:36-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of ways in which an ecological background can turn into something a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:49</a>:</strong>  different in that way, but that's more of what I would consider being an employee.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:49">0:37:49-0:37:55</a>:</strong>  So as far as being an entrepreneur and finding alternative ways beyond...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:55">0:37:55-0:37:59</a>:</strong>  So when you mentioned consulting, I mean that's such a broad thing, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:37:59">0:37:59-0:38:00</a>:</strong>  Because it's a service.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:00">0:38:00-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  You're just offering a service that's helping address some issue for somebody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:06</a>:</strong>  So that's very diverse.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:06">0:38:06-0:38:09</a>:</strong>  You could be helping people with soil health.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:09">0:38:09-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  You could be helping them diagnose plant diseases.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:21</a>:</strong>  You could be consulting on creating interior, rewilding people's interiors of their homes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  or gosh, there's so many things or creating a sustainability plan for a city, recycling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:32</a>:</strong>  program, composting, et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:32">0:38:32-0:38:33</a>:</strong>  And that's just the scratching the surface.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:33">0:38:33-0:38:38</a>:</strong>  I've been talking with somebody recently who does fish genetic analysis and looking at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:38">0:38:38-0:38:41</a>:</strong>  creating a consulting business around that potentially.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:41">0:38:41-0:38:45</a>:</strong>  So there's other alternative things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:45">0:38:45-0:38:49</a>:</strong>  There's the whole side of product creation and marketing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:49">0:38:49-0:38:54</a>:</strong>  For me, for example, I think I can give a more in-depth...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:54">0:38:54-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  This has some diversity in with it too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:39:04</a>:</strong>  I'm part of a small collective in Spring Green, Wisconsin, which is 45 minutes west of Madison.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:04">0:39:04-0:39:09</a>:</strong>  And there's a farm there that my friend Robin has inherited with her brother.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:09">0:39:09-0:39:10</a>:</strong>  It's 160 acres.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:10">0:39:10-0:39:12</a>:</strong>  You and I have talked about it a bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:12">0:39:12-0:39:21</a>:</strong>  And I'll be living there next growing season because we are creating an educational farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:21">0:39:21-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  and retreat center.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  So every cover type on that property from Prairie to Woodland to geothermal greenhouse<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:37</a>:</strong>  to riparian area will have programming and production associated with it so that each<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:37">0:39:37-0:39:43</a>:</strong>  cover type on that property is providing the income for its own enhancement over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:43">0:39:43-0:39:46</a>:</strong>  So what that entails is, yes, I will be consulting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:46">0:39:46-0:39:53</a>:</strong>  I'll be creating a proposal this summer and we'll be looking for funding and bringing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:53">0:39:53-0:39:59</a>:</strong>  in the United Designers to do a plan for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:39:59">0:39:59-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  But also, beyond that, there is so much programming that's going to be happening on that piece<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  of land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:12</a>:</strong>  So really, education is such a huge part of what we do as consultants anyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:12">0:40:12-0:40:18</a>:</strong>  And regardless of at which whatever level the public is at in terms of their knowledge<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:18">0:40:18-0:40:23</a>:</strong>  of certain skills, of certain ways of being and connecting with the earth and others around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:23">0:40:23-0:40:26</a>:</strong>  them, there will always be opportunities to educate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:26">0:40:26-0:40:35</a>:</strong>  But especially now as we're building that inevitable momentum of the wave cresting where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:35">0:40:35-0:40:40</a>:</strong>  regenerative lifestyle and the higher standard of living that can easily be had by being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:40">0:40:40-0:40:47</a>:</strong>  connected to the earth and each other on a deeper and deeper level, where that becomes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:47">0:40:47-0:40:48</a>:</strong>  the norm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:48">0:40:48-0:40:55</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of education that's needed and wanted desperately in both situations where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:55">0:40:55-0:40:56</a>:</strong>  people want nature immersion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:56">0:40:56-0:40:58</a>:</strong>  They want to learn wild edibles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:40:58">0:40:58-0:41:04</a>:</strong>  They want to learn how to grow veggies, build their own timber frame home or straw bale,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:04">0:41:04-0:41:05</a>:</strong>  whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:05">0:41:05-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  So that's a huge part of what's going to be happening on that farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:15</a>:</strong>  So that's an aspect of that diversity is being a facilitator of that type of programming,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:15">0:41:15-0:41:21</a>:</strong>  that type of education, products that come off of the land or that just help people out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:21">0:41:21-0:41:28</a>:</strong>  in general because all we're doing with that piece of property is fulfilling a huge gap<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:35</a>:</strong>  in the availability of healthy local fresh food, the connection between the soil and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:35">0:41:35-0:41:40</a>:</strong>  our gut health, mental health, et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:40">0:41:40-0:41:45</a>:</strong>  That's what I see is that awareness of what are the real issues going on here today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:45">0:41:45-0:41:52</a>:</strong>  And yeah, plastic in the oceans is an issue, but people aren't necessarily going to pay<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:52">0:41:52-0:41:53</a>:</strong>  you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:53">0:41:53-0:41:57</a>:</strong>  I mean, there are people that get paid to clean up plastic in the oceans, for example,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:41:57">0:41:57-0:42:04</a>:</strong>  but if you're walking around Twin Cities, Minnesota, selling a service to clean up the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:04">0:42:04-0:42:09</a>:</strong>  plastic in the ocean or something, it has to relate to, yeah, maybe it relates to somebody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:09">0:42:09-0:42:16</a>:</strong>  feeling a relief of some displaced guilt or something, but.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:16">0:42:16-0:42:20</a>:</strong>  Well tell me how this sits with you, because as ecological designers, we talk so much about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:20">0:42:20-0:42:26</a>:</strong>  the observation process and trying to give as much time and attention to that to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:26">0:42:26-0:42:31</a>:</strong>  educated decisions on how to affect the landscape in which we're interacting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:31">0:42:31-0:42:36</a>:</strong>  And I think that that applies so much to the business model as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:36">0:42:36-0:42:40</a>:</strong>  And if you don't take enough time to really understand the community that you intend to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:40">0:42:40-0:42:44</a>:</strong>  serve, whether it be online, whether it be in your immediate vicinity or somewhere off<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:44">0:42:44-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  somewhere else, you're not going to tap into what the needs, what the pressure points,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:51">0:42:51-0:42:55</a>:</strong>  what the desires of those communities that you're aiming to serve are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:42:55">0:42:55-0:43:00</a>:</strong>  And you might really find that the services or the products that you care to offer are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:00">0:43:00-0:43:05</a>:</strong>  very different from what you initially thought you had to offer based on those needs and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:05">0:43:05-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  desires of the community if you're paying attention.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:11</a>:</strong>  And I know I've come to a lot of different conclusions, partly because I've moved around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:11">0:43:11-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  the world so much in my adult life, that each place has sort of unique circumstances that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:24</a>:</strong>  would make something that you're able to offer valuable to that community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:24">0:43:24-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  Thinking outside of just what you thought you wanted to provide and what these places<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:35</a>:</strong>  actually need or desire could really be the difference between a successful business model,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:35">0:43:35-0:43:42</a>:</strong>  no matter how positive it might be, and one that struggles just for sort of, I guess,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:42">0:43:42-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  short-cutting that observation process, which we put so much time and effort into when we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:48</a>:</strong>  looking into natural systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:48">0:43:48-0:43:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:49">0:43:49-0:43:50</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:43:50">0:43:50-0:44:01</a>:</strong>  So one of the biggest game changers for me around that has been cultivating this openness<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:01">0:44:01-0:44:09</a>:</strong>  to the fact that there is, well, for example, if someone's in a state of experiencing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:09">0:44:09-0:44:15</a>:</strong>  scarcity mindset, there's no reason why an hour later they couldn't make a $5,000 sale<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:15">0:44:15-0:44:19</a>:</strong>  in their business or the next day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:19">0:44:19-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  But in our communities and context, it really comes down to context, but there are solutions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:33</a>:</strong>  that we can offer with our skills, with our gifts, with our personal interests that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:33">0:44:33-0:44:41</a>:</strong>  very economically viable in a lot of different ways and different levels where there is a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:41">0:44:41-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  service that we can offer that just unlocks the whole world for us and really gets at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:52</a>:</strong>  the heart of what people are seeking in terms of the transformation for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:52">0:44:52-0:44:56</a>:</strong>  Because whenever somebody makes a purchase, regardless of whether it's in their business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:44:56">0:44:56-0:45:04</a>:</strong>  and they're joining a business mastermind or they're trying to fix up their home in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:04">0:45:04-0:45:08</a>:</strong>  a certain way, that sale is a transformation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:08">0:45:08-0:45:11</a>:</strong>  It's a personal healing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:11">0:45:11-0:45:17</a>:</strong>  And it should be, at least, and that's when it feels great for everybody involved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:17">0:45:17-0:45:22</a>:</strong>  So in order to get to that place where somebody is making a purchase and they just can't wait<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:26</a>:</strong>  to hand you that check because they know how much it's going to benefit them and it can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:26">0:45:26-0:45:34</a>:</strong>  feel that fresh air coming into their life, creating those connections that bring that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:34">0:45:34-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  context from the standpoint of, we're only here for a finite amount of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:48</a>:</strong>  And so to sit behind a computer or not be out there connecting with others, people might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:45:52</a>:</strong>  describe themselves as an introvert or whatnot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:52">0:45:52-0:45:57</a>:</strong>  I'm an introvert, but all that means for me is that I gain my batteries recharged when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:57">0:45:57-0:45:59</a>:</strong>  I spend time alone in nature, especially.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:45:59">0:45:59-0:46:02</a>:</strong>  Yeah, same with me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:02">0:46:02-0:46:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:03">0:46:03-0:46:09</a>:</strong>  So if you're in the consulting industry, a consulting business, you've got to be excited<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:09">0:46:09-0:46:16</a>:</strong>  about interacting with people and to be able to understand, if you're not feeling excited<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:16">0:46:16-0:46:20</a>:</strong>  about interacting with people, is that just because you don't have a clearly defined package<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:20">0:46:20-0:46:25</a>:</strong>  and offer or is it because you're maybe not in the right business is definitely a question<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:25">0:46:25-0:46:26</a>:</strong>  to ask.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:26">0:46:26-0:46:36</a>:</strong>  But as far as being open to the excitement of understanding where in this person's life,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:36">0:46:36-0:46:44</a>:</strong>  in this experience, do they have something going on that I can help with?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:44">0:46:44-0:46:47</a>:</strong>  First of all, knowing what you do help with is an important piece of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:47">0:46:47-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  So you can know, am I just having a conversation with somebody that's friendly and it really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:46:55">0:46:55-0:47:02</a>:</strong>  doesn't have potential right now as a client who's going to sign on and work with me or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:02">0:47:02-0:47:05</a>:</strong>  is this person just the perfect fit?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:05">0:47:05-0:47:10</a>:</strong>  And it's so different for each business and it's different for each location, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:10">0:47:10-0:47:12</a>:</strong>  regionally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:12">0:47:12-0:47:21</a>:</strong>  But being able to be yourself, be that excited, open, optimistic person, it's easy to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:30</a>:</strong>  closed off, especially early on in business and be afraid of making mistakes or putting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:30">0:47:30-0:47:33</a>:</strong>  oneself out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:33">0:47:33-0:47:41</a>:</strong>  But it only ever is a benefit because that's the only way we're really going to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:41">0:47:41-0:47:45</a>:</strong>  what people are seeking and how we can actually be of service in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:45">0:47:45-0:47:46</a>:</strong>  I love that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:46">0:47:46-0:47:51</a>:</strong>  And it really flies in the face of what you've heard in so many different spheres of performance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:51">0:47:51-0:47:57</a>:</strong>  where the concept of fake it till you make it or kind of put on a front until you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:47:57">0:47:57-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  actually live it genuinely, I think is really starting to erode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:08</a>:</strong>  As you mentioned earlier, too, with the internet, with so many options available to us and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:08">0:48:08-0:48:13</a>:</strong>  messages constantly bombarding our sphere, it's getting easier and easier to tell the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:13">0:48:13-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  authentic ones, the ones that are coming from a place of honesty and very easy to weed out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:19</a>:</strong>  the ones that aren't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:19">0:48:19-0:48:25</a>:</strong>  And I really think that, you know, sort of to break with that narrative, there's no shame<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:25">0:48:25-0:48:30</a>:</strong>  in in talking about where you are in your journey and knowing that increasingly a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:30">0:48:30-0:48:35</a>:</strong>  of people are going to resonate with that message and could be even the thing that creates<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:35">0:48:35-0:48:40</a>:</strong>  the relationships that propel you to another level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:40">0:48:40-0:48:47</a>:</strong>  What are some of the other factors in sort of unlocking the potential or I guess getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:47">0:48:47-0:48:53</a>:</strong>  past the hurdles or maybe what are the hurdles that you see holding back eco minded entrepreneurs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:53">0:48:53-0:48:56</a>:</strong>  or socially minded entrepreneurs in that way?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:48:56">0:48:56-0:49:02</a>:</strong>  I think a big thing is, you know, I had a really powerful experience in my own business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:02">0:49:02-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  recently with this, but it's so I would say it's so easy to get lost in that, that scarcity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  mindset or that, oh, I really need to make this sale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:24</a>:</strong>  But it's also easy to come from a place of, you know, genuinely seeking to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:24">0:49:24-0:49:25</a>:</strong>  somebody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:25">0:49:25-0:49:31</a>:</strong>  But there's, you know, those are two sides of the same, the same coin, really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:31">0:49:31-0:49:36</a>:</strong>  Because who we are, when we're interacting with the people that, you know, may become<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:36">0:49:36-0:49:47</a>:</strong>  our clients, it really comes down to cultivating our ability to be present.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:47">0:49:47-0:49:52</a>:</strong>  And the reason why we're getting into ecological design is not to make money, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:52">0:49:52-0:49:54</a>:</strong>  That's not the primary motivator.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:54">0:49:54-0:49:59</a>:</strong>  I do a lot of money mindset work with my clients, because it's a really important part of making<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:49:59">0:49:59-0:50:04</a>:</strong>  sales and not being concerned about, you know, the price that you're giving something at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:04">0:50:04-0:50:12</a>:</strong>  the value in which, you know, the level at which a value based design, you know, is priced,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:12">0:50:12-0:50:19</a>:</strong>  for example, because if we are this, what I'm saying is that this money mindset thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:19">0:50:19-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  is one of the biggest obstacles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:21">0:50:21-0:50:31</a>:</strong>  It's so pervasive in modern culture, and especially in our permaculture ecological design communities,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:31">0:50:31-0:50:36</a>:</strong>  and it holds 80% of people back from having a successful business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:36">0:50:36-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  And there's a spectrum like anything, you know, some people might be so against the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:40">0:50:40-0:50:46</a>:</strong>  idea of money that they're living off grid, and don't have, you know, a phone because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:46">0:50:46-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  they don't want to support any anything related to the idea of capitalism.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:50">0:50:50-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  And I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  But then there are other people who are really trying hard in their business, and they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:51:03</a>:</strong>  going around to having sales conversations, but they're so focused on the concern about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:03">0:51:03-0:51:10</a>:</strong>  the sale falling through, or saying the right thing, that they're not being authentic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:10">0:51:10-0:51:14</a>:</strong>  They're not understanding what the client's really looking for, and thus their package<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:14">0:51:14-0:51:16</a>:</strong>  isn't aligning with the client's needs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:16">0:51:16-0:51:18</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:18">0:51:18-0:51:23</a>:</strong>  And you know, like you said, many of these narratives are really pervasive in entrepreneurial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:23">0:51:23-0:51:32</a>:</strong>  circles, especially startup circles, and kind of to transition out here before we wrap up,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:32">0:51:32-0:51:36</a>:</strong>  what is some advice that you would give to people, especially in their beginning phases<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:36">0:51:36-0:51:41</a>:</strong>  of starting their own business or breaking out on their own, either to keep in mind that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:41">0:51:41-0:51:45</a>:</strong>  will kind of guide them through some of the hurdles that they're inevitably going to face<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:45">0:51:45-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  as early stage entrepreneurs, or maybe tips from your own experience that helped you get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:51:59</a>:</strong>  past a lot of the roadblocks or the hurdles of the initial stages?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:51:59">0:51:59-0:52:03</a>:</strong>  Top of the list is be excited about what you're doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:03">0:52:03-0:52:04</a>:</strong>  And be assertive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:04">0:52:04-0:52:10</a>:</strong>  You know, it's not about being the know it all, encyclopedia brown of the consulting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:10">0:52:10-0:52:15</a>:</strong>  industry you're in, or you know, landscape design, whatnot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:15">0:52:15-0:52:22</a>:</strong>  But if you are genuinely excited, and ready for a challenge, you know, so many designers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:22">0:52:22-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  when they're starting out hold themselves back because they think, oh, my drawing skills<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:31</a>:</strong>  aren't good enough, or I don't know my plants well enough, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:31">0:52:31-0:52:36</a>:</strong>  And you know, while there are real needs as far as our expertise, in terms of selecting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:36">0:52:36-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  the right thing for a certain spot or whatnot, or certain situation, you know, what's stopping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:48</a>:</strong>  you from learning other than your own mindset?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:54</a>:</strong>  So you know, people might be timid in a conversation telling somebody about what they do, what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:54">0:52:54-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  the point?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:52:59</a>:</strong>  You're just telling somebody what you're doing, you're not committing yourself to designing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:52:59">0:52:59-0:53:06</a>:</strong>  some breakwater on the edge of Lake Superior, or that requires insane engineering or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:06">0:53:06-0:53:11</a>:</strong>  You know, it's, I think a lot of a lot of people at any level of experience, but especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:11">0:53:11-0:53:21</a>:</strong>  starting out, they see the future is unknown, of course, from making sales to the types<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:21">0:53:21-0:53:24</a>:</strong>  of projects to the types of clients they'll be interacting with, what's going to come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:24">0:53:24-0:53:26</a>:</strong>  up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:26">0:53:26-0:53:32</a>:</strong>  And they rather than moving toward a place of love, they get caught in that place of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:32">0:53:32-0:53:39</a>:</strong>  fear, which results in constriction in the voice in the way one might interact with other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:39">0:53:39-0:53:44</a>:</strong>  people, and then the resulting symptom beyond that is constriction of the business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:44">0:53:44-0:53:53</a>:</strong>  And the only expansive thing in our universe is just this sheer joy of being alive, of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:53">0:53:53-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  movement of fluidity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:54:03</a>:</strong>  So you know, it's a total fractalization of our inner state.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:03">0:54:03-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  And so being really excited about what we're doing, telling people, yeah, I designed edible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:11</a>:</strong>  landscapes, you know, what's wrong with telling somebody about that if you're super passionate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:11">0:54:11-0:54:17</a>:</strong>  about it, rather than allowing this fear of, oh, I don't want to mess up their property,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:17">0:54:17-0:54:21</a>:</strong>  so I'm going to be, you know, really bashful about saying what I do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:21">0:54:21-0:54:26</a>:</strong>  You know, you don't have enough information to even know if that person's a right fit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:26">0:54:26-0:54:31</a>:</strong>  You're just telling them, yeah, heck yeah, I'm super stoked to be talking to you and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:31">0:54:31-0:54:33</a>:</strong>  I design edible landscapes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:33">0:54:33-0:54:34</a>:</strong>  Sure, sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:34">0:54:34-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  You want to know more?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:38">0:54:38-0:54:43</a>:</strong>  And I would say to just to add on to that, the one thing that has really helped me and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:43">0:54:43-0:54:48</a>:</strong>  I have been really thick headed about it from the beginning is asking for help.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:48">0:54:48-0:54:53</a>:</strong>  I don't know where this mentality comes in, especially around, and I definitely find it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:53">0:54:53-0:54:56</a>:</strong>  more in the United States than in so many other countries where I've lived in where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:54:56">0:54:56-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  collaboration and closeness of community and family is much more prevalent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:06</a>:</strong>  But this idea that, you know, it's somehow a bigger success if you did it by yourself<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:06">0:55:06-0:55:13</a>:</strong>  or succeed as much if you asked for help along the way is horrible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:13">0:55:13-0:55:17</a>:</strong>  It really holds people back for a long, long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:17">0:55:17-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  And you know, this podcast in particular is probably my most consistent effort in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:22">0:55:22-0:55:27</a>:</strong>  last couple of years of consistently asking for help and reaching out to people who I've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:27">0:55:27-0:55:32</a>:</strong>  always wanted to talk to to get their advice and ask the questions after reading their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:32">0:55:32-0:55:36</a>:</strong>  books or, you know, consuming their content or admiring their work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:36">0:55:36-0:55:40</a>:</strong>  And you know, along that line, Pete, could you tell our listeners at home how they can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:40">0:55:40-0:55:42</a>:</strong>  get in contact with you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:42">0:55:42-0:55:47</a>:</strong>  Because your advice, your guidance, your friendship has been really helpful for me since we've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:47">0:55:47-0:55:48</a>:</strong>  known each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:48">0:55:48-0:55:53</a>:</strong>  And I would really recommend that if anybody else is starting out in these types of spheres,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:53">0:55:53-0:55:57</a>:</strong>  that they at least get to know some of the content that you've put out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:57">0:55:57-0:55:58</a>:</strong>  So how can they find you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:58">0:55:58-0:55:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah, thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:55:59">0:55:59-0:56:01</a>:</strong>  And I, I love our friendship as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:01">0:56:01-0:56:02</a>:</strong>  Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:02">0:56:02-0:56:03</a>:</strong>  It's been awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:03">0:56:03-0:56:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so I am getting a new website up called petewiden.com.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:09">0:56:09-0:56:19</a>:</strong>  So that's petewiden2eyes.com slash discover will be the page where you can explore setting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-pete-widin/#t=0:56:19">0:56:19-0:56:25</a>:</strong>  up a call with me to talk about what it might look like to get real results in your business,<br />
