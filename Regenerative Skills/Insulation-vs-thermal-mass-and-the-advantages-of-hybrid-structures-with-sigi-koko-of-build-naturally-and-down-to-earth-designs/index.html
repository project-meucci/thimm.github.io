<p><strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:03</a>:</strong>  Hello and welcome to this episode of the abundant edge, I'm your host Oliver Gaucher<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:03">0:00:03-0:00:10</a>:</strong>  This is the podcast all about the worlds of natural building permaculture and regenerative living. I've got a great guest for you today<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:10">0:00:10-0:00:12</a>:</strong>  So let's get started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:20">0:00:20-0:00:23</a>:</strong>  In this episode I had the pleasure of interviewing Siggy Coco<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:24">0:00:24-0:00:28</a>:</strong>  Siggy is the founder of down-to-earth design and can be found on build naturally calm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:28">0:00:28-0:00:32</a>:</strong>  Ziggy is an architect builder and teacher extraordinaire<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:32">0:00:32-0:00:39</a>:</strong>  She founded down-to-earth design back in 1998 and has been designing and building with natural materials in the mid-atlantic region ever since then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:40">0:00:40-0:00:42</a>:</strong>  She's an encyclopedia of building and design knowledge<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:42">0:00:42-0:00:50</a>:</strong>  Which she often uses to help guide new builders and designers on natural building forums on Facebook and on her blog in this episode<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:50">0:00:50-0:00:55</a>:</strong>  We get to talk in depth about the anatomy of straw bale walls the key differences between thermal mass and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:00:55">0:00:55-0:01:00</a>:</strong>  Installation and how to make use of both wall systems for your location and your climate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:00">0:01:00-0:01:06</a>:</strong>  Siggy also gives invaluable advice for troubleshooting some of the trickier aspects of applying natural plasters and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:06">0:01:06-0:01:13</a>:</strong>  Also different additives to the mix. So keep a notebook on hand for this really information heavy interview now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:13">0:01:13-0:01:18</a>:</strong>  I know a couple of you are thinking hey, wait a second. I think we've heard from Siggy Coco before and that's true<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:18">0:01:18-0:01:23</a>:</strong>  I did an interview with her a couple of months back and I put it in an article which you can find under the news<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:23">0:01:23-0:01:27</a>:</strong>  Section at abundant edge calm so if anybody wants to get to know a little bit more about her background<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:28">0:01:28-0:01:32</a>:</strong>  How she got started in natural building and a lot of other things that we won't cover in this interview<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:32">0:01:32-0:01:35</a>:</strong>  It's all in the article under news on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:35">0:01:35-0:01:42</a>:</strong>  Abundant edge calm now just a little heads up before we get started the place where I'm living and working in Guatemala right now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:42">0:01:42-0:01:48</a>:</strong>  The owners have nine dogs on the property. So you're gonna hear some minor contributions from our canine friends<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:49">0:01:49-0:01:53</a>:</strong>  Every once in a while they go into a little frenzy and get all excited and stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:53">0:01:53-0:01:56</a>:</strong>  And it's not gonna be hard to get the context and the information out of the interview<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:01:56">0:01:56-0:02:02</a>:</strong>  But just know that they're gonna make a couple of contributions to the episode throughout. So with that little advisory<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:02">0:02:02-0:02:05</a>:</strong>  Let's get right into the interview. Here's sticky cocoa<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:05">0:02:05-0:02:09</a>:</strong>  Thank you so much for joining me today. See you Coco. It's a pleasure to have you back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:10">0:02:10-0:02:12</a>:</strong>  Well, thanks for having me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:16</a>:</strong>  How are things with you in the middle of winter in the Northeast right now?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:16">0:02:16-0:02:23</a>:</strong>  Oh, well, we've gotten out pretty late this winter so far, but we're about to get a little snitch on tonight. So<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:24">0:02:24-0:02:31</a>:</strong>  My goodness and you're managing build projects in that weather. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah goes all winter long<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:32">0:02:32-0:02:34</a>:</strong>  Have some eaters<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:34">0:02:34-0:02:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I can imagine I remember some of those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:37">0:02:37-0:02:41</a>:</strong>  Construction projects that I worked on in Minnesota in those types of conditions, too<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:41">0:02:41-0:02:47</a>:</strong>  Well, hey, let's jump right into the first question because I know we've got a lot of material to cover if you're ready<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:47">0:02:47-0:02:53</a>:</strong>  Sounds great. All right. Now. I know that you have specialized in straw bale construction since you started your company<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:54">0:02:54-0:02:58</a>:</strong>  Can you explain the anatomy of a straw bale building for me?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:02:58">0:02:58-0:03:03</a>:</strong>  Sure, so there's two different approaches to travel building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:03">0:03:03-0:03:07</a>:</strong>  You think you're big fuzzy brick straw?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:07">0:03:07-0:03:11</a>:</strong>  You can either lay those bricks and then put<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:12">0:03:12-0:03:18</a>:</strong>  Structural beam on top of it and tie that down to the foundation and then actually use the straw to fold up the roof<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:19">0:03:19-0:03:21</a>:</strong>  Building and that's called load bearing straw bale<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:22">0:03:22-0:03:26</a>:</strong>  Or you can build some frame structure, which is what I usually do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:30">0:03:30-0:03:32</a>:</strong>  And build the frame<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:32">0:03:32-0:03:34</a>:</strong>  Either<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:35">0:03:35-0:03:40</a>:</strong>  Put your roof on and then infill the straw also laying like bricks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:44</a>:</strong>  Either way<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:44">0:03:44-0:03:46</a>:</strong>  And then it usually get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:50">0:03:50-0:03:56</a>:</strong>  Sure now you said that you mostly do the timber framing because of the resources that you have in the weather that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:03:59</a>:</strong>  have to protect against in your region, what would be some of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:03:59">0:03:59-0:04:03</a>:</strong>  acceptable ways to do a load-bearing straw bale house<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:06</a>:</strong>  or what conditions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  In what conditions would it be acceptable? So there's actually there's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:17">0:04:17-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  England and it rains there all the time and she came up with a method that would work anywhere and that is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:24">0:04:24-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  She builds the roof on the ground and then she temporarily props it up and then builds the building below<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:30">0:04:30-0:04:35</a>:</strong>  load bearing straw bale and then just lowers the roof onto the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:40</a>:</strong>  load bearing straw bale walls and that would work anywhere but if you live in a dry climate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:40">0:04:40-0:04:44</a>:</strong>  You wouldn't have to go to that link. You could just build your load bearings walls<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:45">0:04:45-0:04:48</a>:</strong>  compress the top beam that goes around the wall<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:48">0:04:48-0:04:55</a>:</strong>  If you're not worried about rain you can just build your wall, but if you're worried about rain<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:04:58">0:04:58-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  That's really cool I haven't heard of that method before where could listeners go to find<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  Instructions on how to build that way. Oh<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:07</a>:</strong>  That's such a good question<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:07">0:05:07-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  And I forget the name of her website off the top of my head, but she does have a book<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  I'm at my stuff right now trying to find it for you. Oh<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:20">0:05:20-0:05:27</a>:</strong>  Don't worry about it. You can tell me about this later and I can put all that in the show notes on the website<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:27">0:05:27-0:05:34</a>:</strong>  Perfect. That's awesome. Okay. Now tell me what are some of the advantages and disadvantages of a straw bale building?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:34">0:05:34-0:05:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so I would say your main advantage with straw bale is it's the least expensive way to get the most insulating wall system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:48">0:05:48-0:05:50</a>:</strong>  And<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:50">0:05:50-0:05:54</a>:</strong>  It as well is non-toxic. It's healthy for you, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:54">0:05:54-0:05:59</a>:</strong>  So you get all these side benefits, but I would say the main advantage is that you're a very low cost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:05:59">0:05:59-0:06:04</a>:</strong>  You're getting super insulated super energy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:06:07">0:06:07-0:06:14</a>:</strong>  And to me one of the most exciting advantages is that because it's something that's simple to learn you can learn within a day<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:06:14">0:06:14-0:06:18</a>:</strong>  You can feel more or less like an expert in laying straw bales<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:06:20">0:06:20-0:06:24</a>:</strong>  Resizing them, shaping them, knocking them, anything that needs to happen to build a wall<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:06:24">0:06:24-0:06:32</a>:</strong>  And what that means is there is an opportunity to participate hands-on with a straw bale building that wouldn't happen with almost any other construction technique.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:06:36">0:06:36-0:06:39</a>:</strong>  Well, that happens with natural building generally but any conventional construction technique that we use today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:49</a>:</strong>  So to me those are the sort of the biggest most exciting advantages and I see the biggest disadvantage is that you're trading off<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:06:49">0:06:49-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  Cost and ease of construction, you're trading that awkward time. It takes longer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:02</a>:</strong>  So that either means you need to make really good friends and invite them over for a work party or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:04">0:07:04-0:07:09</a>:</strong>  You know the labor piece is gonna cost more so one or the other or it's gonna take longer, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:09">0:07:09-0:07:11</a>:</strong>  So if you're doing it yourself, then it will take longer to build.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:11">0:07:11-0:07:17</a>:</strong>  So what part of the process takes longer than putting up say a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:18">0:07:18-0:07:21</a>:</strong>  stick stud frame construction? Well, so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:29</a>:</strong>  With well the bales period take a long time if you so if you have two people building a stud frame<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:29">0:07:29-0:07:34</a>:</strong>  Wall, they can put a wall up in a day. I mean less<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:34">0:07:34-0:07:40</a>:</strong>  If you have two people installing straw bales<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:51</a>:</strong>  Just because you're individually putting each bale in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:52">0:07:52-0:07:56</a>:</strong>  Sure, then the difference is you're then plaster ready, right? So but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:07:56">0:07:56-0:08:01</a>:</strong>  But it's just more time consuming. Each individual bale is just placed in the same place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:08</a>:</strong>  So you also work with a lot of earthen elements in your designs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:08">0:08:08-0:08:16</a>:</strong>  Can you explain some of the advantages of mixing these wall systems straw bale and say cob or adobe and some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:16">0:08:16-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  Specific examples where they might work really well together<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:20">0:08:20-0:08:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so it's sort of the perfect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:23">0:08:23-0:08:26</a>:</strong>  perfect combination of materials in my opinion, so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:35</a>:</strong>  Earthen materials are really really versatile, right? You can use them to make floors, you can make flat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:35">0:08:35-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  You can make adobe bricks, you can make cob walls<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  Which is basically adobe but you place it right in the middle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  At the build.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:50</a>:</strong>  You can do ramsors. So there's so many different materials that you can make with clay<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:50">0:08:50-0:08:56</a>:</strong>  And the difference is that clay is a mass material and the straw is an inflating material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:08:56">0:08:56-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  When you combine mass inside super insulation you end up with a much more efficient total building envelope<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:04">0:09:04-0:09:11</a>:</strong>  That doesn't want to change temperature inside. It's much more consistent temperature regardless of what is going on outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:11">0:09:11-0:09:19</a>:</strong>  So you end up with a more efficient wall system for one and then the second is that clay specifically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:20">0:09:20-0:09:23</a>:</strong>  acts as a humidity controller. So if the air is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:26</a>:</strong>  So be sure of bathrooms for example<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:26">0:09:26-0:09:31</a>:</strong>  If you when you take a shower and the air in the bathroom is really humid and you have clay walls<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:31">0:09:31-0:09:35</a>:</strong>  Well, it absorbs that excess excess humidity instead of the humidity condensing on the wall<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:35">0:09:35-0:09:41</a>:</strong>  So when you get out of a shower, when I get out of my shower and I don't have clay in my bathroom<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:41">0:09:41-0:09:43</a>:</strong>  The mirror is all foggy, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:43">0:09:43-0:09:49</a>:</strong>  But if you have clay in there the mirror is not foggy because the clay has absorbed the excess humidity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:49">0:09:49-0:09:55</a>:</strong>  And then it releases it when the air has less humidity than the wall. And it never is wet. It's not that the wall is getting wet<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:55">0:09:55-0:09:59</a>:</strong>  It's just absorbing the excess that's in the air and then releasing it at the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:09:59">0:09:59-0:10:05</a>:</strong>  So it's sort of a humidity regulator as well. So where I live where we have quite humid summers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:06">0:10:06-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  You increase the comfort inside by having high mass and the humidity controller.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:17</a>:</strong>  So that's sort of this little passive air conditioning. It's fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:17">0:10:17-0:10:19</a>:</strong>  And it's addictive to play with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:19">0:10:19-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  Throw that out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's not something to overlook either.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:23">0:10:23-0:10:25</a>:</strong>  These materials are super fun to work with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:25">0:10:25-0:10:29</a>:</strong>  And that's remarkable. I've never heard that about the mirror not fogging up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:29">0:10:29-0:10:36</a>:</strong>  A lot of the natural material bathrooms that I've used in the past have been plastered with lime.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:36">0:10:36-0:10:40</a>:</strong>  And they're slightly absorbed but not nearly as much as clay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:40">0:10:40-0:10:44</a>:</strong>  So I'm still yet to see that but that's really interesting to hear.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:44">0:10:44-0:10:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's my favorite little magic trick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:48">0:10:48-0:10:56</a>:</strong>  Alright, so let's get really in depth into the issue that I know that you talk a lot about on the Facebook forums<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:56">0:10:56-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  and the other places where you interact with the natural building community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:06</a>:</strong>  This is the infamous topic, what is the difference between thermal mass and insulation?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:06">0:11:06-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  And how can you explain some of the advantages of where each of these different types of wall systems apply most advantageously?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, this is my pet topic. And I feel like it's the most misunderstood piece of natural building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:28">0:11:28-0:11:33</a>:</strong>  That's what happens very frequently when there's photos of these beautiful natural buildings<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:33">0:11:33-0:11:38</a>:</strong>  and people fall in love with the specific style or look or specific building even and they say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:38">0:11:38-0:11:40</a>:</strong>  okay, I'm just going to repeat that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:40">0:11:40-0:11:44</a>:</strong>  But they don't think about, okay, what is the climate where I'm living?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:11:47</a>:</strong>  Does that material actually make sense?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:47">0:11:47-0:11:54</a>:</strong>  So it's really, to me, imperative to understand the difference between insulation and thermal mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:11:54">0:11:54-0:12:00</a>:</strong>  And the difference is that an insulation material takes energy from point A, one side of the wall,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:00">0:12:00-0:12:10</a>:</strong>  one side of the roof, from inside or outside, to point B and it flows down the flow of the energy from one side to the other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:10">0:12:10-0:12:14</a>:</strong>  So it's like a resistor to that thermal flow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:14">0:12:14-0:12:18</a>:</strong>  So if you picture heat always travels from the hot side to the cold side.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:18">0:12:18-0:12:25</a>:</strong>  And if you're trying to heat your house and you have high insulation, then the heat is going to stay inside more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:25">0:12:25-0:12:28</a>:</strong>  and it's not going to flow through the wall to the outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:28">0:12:28-0:12:36</a>:</strong>  And the thing with almost every insulation material that is actually insulating are little tiny air pockets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:36">0:12:36-0:12:45</a>:</strong>  So if you picture these little air pockets that are all next to each other, the temperature has to change in one air pocket<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:45">0:12:45-0:12:50</a>:</strong>  and then transfer to the next air pocket and transfer to the next and that's a really slow process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:50">0:12:50-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  So if you picture the straw bill, for example, that it's a straw and inside that straw is air.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:13:00</a>:</strong>  And even when the straw is compressed, there's still little air pockets in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:00">0:13:00-0:13:08</a>:</strong>  And it's that air that is actually resisting the thermal flow from one side of the wall to the other side of the wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:08">0:13:08-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  So it's the heat's a hot side hot and the cool side cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:15</a>:</strong>  Thermal mass is more like a...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:15">0:13:15-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  The molecules in gas are really far apart.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:27</a>:</strong>  Isn't that the reason why temperature has a difficult time changing in between those spaces, just because they're so removed from one another?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:27">0:13:27-0:13:32</a>:</strong>  So it's literally a little bubble of air.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:32">0:13:32-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  Picture bubble wrap shrunken down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:37</a>:</strong>  It's not even the molecule of the air.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:37">0:13:37-0:13:40</a>:</strong>  It's because you need a heat transfer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:40">0:13:40-0:13:47</a>:</strong>  So you're transferring the heat from one bubble in the bubble wrap to the next bubble in the bubble wrap to the next bubble in the bubble wrap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:49</a>:</strong>  And there's a space in between.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:49">0:13:49-0:13:52</a>:</strong>  So in order to transfer that heat, it's a very slow process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:52">0:13:52-0:13:54</a>:</strong>  Sure, that's a great way to visualize it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:54">0:13:54-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:00</a>:</strong>  And bubble wrap would be a great influencer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:00">0:14:00-0:14:02</a>:</strong>  There's air pockets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:02">0:14:02-0:14:04</a>:</strong>  It's a ship that doesn't come out of the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:04">0:14:04-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  And the...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  I know, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:09</a>:</strong>  Well, it's a plastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:09">0:14:09-0:14:13</a>:</strong>  So the thermal mass, it's not an insulator.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:13">0:14:13-0:14:19</a>:</strong>  It's not slowing the flow of temperature from the hot side to the cold side.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:19">0:14:19-0:14:25</a>:</strong>  What it's doing is it's acting like a battery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:25">0:14:25-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  And so if you picture a rechargeable battery, that absorbs and releases heat energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:46</a>:</strong>  So when there is an excess of heat energy, whether it's because it's hot outside and the air is hot, whether it's the sun hitting something, whether it's you put this thermal mass next to a fireplace so the air doesn't come out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:46">0:14:46-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  You absorb the heat from the fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:14:59</a>:</strong>  Any time there's an excess of heat, the battery, the thermal mass, will absorb the excess heat and store it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:14:59">0:14:59-0:15:07</a>:</strong>  And whenever the ambient temperature around is cooler than the mass, it releases that heat back into the air.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:15:07">0:15:07-0:15:18</a>:</strong>  So effectively what it does is it tries to come to equilibrium all the time between the air temperature on either side of the wall and the battery of the thermal mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:15:18">0:15:18-0:15:30</a>:</strong>  So what happens when you have a thermal mass material in a cold climate is you're trying to be warm inside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:15:30">0:15:30-0:15:32</a>:</strong>  It's cold outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:15:32">0:15:32-0:15:43</a>:</strong>  And you have, instead of an insulation, instead of something that's just keeping the heat in, you have a battery that's trying to come to equilibrium between your inside temperature and your outside temperature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:15:43">0:15:43-0:15:48</a>:</strong>  So the outside is constantly trying to take the heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:15:48">0:15:48-0:15:51</a>:</strong>  So the mass itself is trying to take the heat from the inside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:15:51">0:15:51-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  And it's trying to extend it to warm up the outside all the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:07</a>:</strong>  And the worst bit is that you have generally, if you're in a climate with winter, you have a more humid environment inside than you have outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:16:07">0:16:07-0:16:20</a>:</strong>  And what that means is that that mass, which is trying to come to equilibrium between, let's say, 20 degrees outside and you're trying to have it 65 degrees outside, that's a 45 degree temperature change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:16:20">0:16:20-0:16:31</a>:</strong>  And somewhere in that wall system, it is freezing. There's a freezing point, right? It hits 32 degrees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:16:31">0:16:31-0:16:37</a>:</strong>  And the humidity inside your space is trying to travel through that clay thermal mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:16:37">0:16:37-0:16:40</a>:</strong>  It hits that cold point and it extends through the wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:16:40">0:16:40-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  And now you have liquid in the same spot in your wall and it can build up over time and that can cause mold blooms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  So you can end up with a mold bloom inside your wall that can produce long materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:17:02</a>:</strong>  And so when people, I think the confusion is that people think, oh well, a cob wall or an adobe wall, it takes a long time to heat up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:02">0:17:02-0:17:07</a>:</strong>  So it must be an insulator. That is not the point. An insulator doesn't heat up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:07">0:17:07-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  An insulator is containing the heat on one side and not allowing it to travel to the other side.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:28</a>:</strong>  And so if you live, so my rule of thumb is that if you live somewhere where you will use energy to heat or cool your space, ever,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:28">0:17:28-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  you should have an insulator between you and the outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:38</a>:</strong>  Now does that count places where people use energy to cool or heat their space unnecessarily?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:45</a>:</strong>  Because there's a lot of warm climates where people run their air conditioning and there are much better ways to cool that space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:45">0:17:45-0:17:49</a>:</strong>  Right. So that would be the caveat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:49">0:17:49-0:17:58</a>:</strong>  So to me, as a designer, what I would try to do first is design it so that it stays passively comfortable in that climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:17:58">0:17:58-0:18:07</a>:</strong>  What are the strategies? And if you live, you know, there are passive solar homes in Colorado that use zero heat energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:18:07">0:18:07-0:18:16</a>:</strong>  It's sunny every single day there. Right? I think they have 30 cloudy days a year or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:18:16">0:18:16-0:18:26</a>:</strong>  So if you live in a climate that's sunny enough, even if it's cold, you could have a passive way to heat your space,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:18:26">0:18:26-0:18:30</a>:</strong>  stay comfortable inside, not need heat energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:18:30">0:18:30-0:18:36</a>:</strong>  But the only way to keep that solar energy inside is to be insulated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:18:36">0:18:36-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  If you built with cob in Colorado and you used the sun to heat the space,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  and the cob was between you and the outside, not just of a wall, but between you and the outside,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:58</a>:</strong>  then you're still overnight going to lose all that heat to the cob in the outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:18:58">0:18:58-0:19:05</a>:</strong>  But if you super inflate and you gather the sun energy directly,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:19:05">0:19:05-0:19:11</a>:</strong>  then you're going to keep that energy inside. Does that make sense?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:19:11">0:19:11-0:19:17</a>:</strong>  Yes, absolutely. And I think that's going to make sense to a lot of people who have had some misconceptions about how that works as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:19:17">0:19:17-0:19:30</a>:</strong>  That was really well illustrated. So are there any appropriate applications for thermal mass materials in exterior walls, specifically in cold climates?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:19:30">0:19:30-0:19:38</a>:</strong>  So I would say to me the answer is no. And there's one caveat. And that caveat to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:19:38">0:19:38-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  So we're talking exterior walls, right? We're talking walls between your space and the outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:49</a>:</strong>  So the caveat would be if it's a space that's never going to be heated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:19:49">0:19:49-0:19:54</a>:</strong>  So I would build a cob shed here, no problem. I wouldn't worry about that at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:19:54">0:19:54-0:20:02</a>:</strong>  Because it's going to be the same ambient temperature on both sides. So it's not going to have a viewpoint, it's not going to have a chance of humidity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:20:02">0:20:02-0:20:07</a>:</strong>  And I'm not trying to keep the space. So that would be totally fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:20:07">0:20:07-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  And then using a combination of the two is almost always in almost every climate, a combination of the two is your best solution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  So if you take the Colorado example, where you have super sunny days and you're trying to naturally heat your home without using energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:40</a>:</strong>  If you put heavy insulation, so let's say straw bills, all around the outside to keep whatever you've warmed up inside and all of the cold outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:20:40">0:20:40-0:20:47</a>:</strong>  And then toward the south where the sun gets low in the wintertime but it's high in the summertime.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:20:47">0:20:47-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  You can put glass that will be shaded when the sun is high, but it will be in full sun view when the sun is low in the winter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:21:00</a>:</strong>  And then you could put, it's called a tromwool, t-r-o-m-b-e.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:00">0:21:00-0:21:09</a>:</strong>  And you could put a thermal mass tromwool between the glass and the south and your inside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:09">0:21:09-0:21:14</a>:</strong>  Let the sun hit that battery, that thermal mass battery, and heat up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:14">0:21:14-0:21:18</a>:</strong>  And now you've just gotten a free battery of heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:18">0:21:18-0:21:21</a>:</strong>  Every single day it recharges from the sun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:21">0:21:21-0:21:27</a>:</strong>  And that battery lets the heat go into your space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:27">0:21:27-0:21:35</a>:</strong>  If that wall were stuck on the outside with no glass, then it would be equally releasing it back to the outside as it was in the space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:35">0:21:35-0:21:44</a>:</strong>  So the glass there, it says, no, no, come on in, stay inside where it's warm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:44">0:21:44-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  So it's usually a combination of the two.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  And there's lots of ways to use that combination, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:53</a>:</strong>  So earth and floors are a way to add mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:21:53">0:21:53-0:22:01</a>:</strong>  If you use two inches of clay plaster evenly throughout an entire hall,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:01">0:22:01-0:22:08</a>:</strong>  it adds enough mass to mitigate temperature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:08">0:22:08-0:22:17</a>:</strong>  So when you have big temperatures swinging that side, and you often have two insulations,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:17">0:22:17-0:22:22</a>:</strong>  plus two inches of thermal mass, two inches of clay plaster on all the walls,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:22">0:22:22-0:22:25</a>:</strong>  would eliminate those temperatures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:25">0:22:25-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  Yes, it's remarkable how much you can accomplish on that thermal mass just with a plaster like you were talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:31">0:22:31-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  Now back to something that you said a little bit earlier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:42</a>:</strong>  One of the risks of having that humidity on the inside when there are major temperature differentials between interior and exterior,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:42">0:22:42-0:22:45</a>:</strong>  you can get mold blooms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:45">0:22:45-0:22:52</a>:</strong>  Is there any risk of having actual freezing moisture inside of your walls as well?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:52">0:22:52-0:22:55</a>:</strong>  You mean if there's straw bale walls?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:55">0:22:55-0:22:58</a>:</strong>  If there's thermal mass walls.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:22:58">0:22:58-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  Oh, if you have an interior clay wall?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  No, if you have an exterior earthen wall or thermal mass wall, you were talking about having the humidity from the interior reaching a point on the exterior that's actually at a freezing point and condensing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:20</a>:</strong>  And that's where mold can bloom.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:23:20">0:23:20-0:23:29</a>:</strong>  Is there a risk as well for those spaces to actually freeze and expand and erode the walls?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:23:29">0:23:29-0:23:31</a>:</strong>  I feel like I'm not completely understanding your question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:23:31">0:23:31-0:23:41</a>:</strong>  So if you had a mass material as an exterior wall between you and the outside, then you will have that condensation point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:23:41">0:23:41-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  And because it's a given point every single time that you have the same temperature differential from inside to outside, you're going to have the same condensation point every time, which means it's, I'm going to back up a little.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:24:10</a>:</strong>  If humidity can travel freely, so humidity is airborne moisture, if that airborne moisture, that part of it, can flow, is never allowed to condense into liquid water and is allowed to flow freely through wall systems, you will not ever have a problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:24:10">0:24:10-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  In our climate, there are some extreme tropical climates where you would, but nowhere in the U.S. would you have that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:35</a>:</strong>  If you have an artificial condensation point, which would be either something that is thermally cold, like metal, or because you can guarantee a freezing point inside the wall system,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:24:35">0:24:35-0:24:45</a>:</strong>  for example, if it's a cob wall and you generally have a 45 degree differential in the wall, then the condensation point is going to be the same place every time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:24:45">0:24:45-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  Then what happens is you have this humidity, it's in the air, it's fine, it's causing no problems whatsoever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  It hits that point where it condense, it turns into liquid water, and it slowly migrates down the wall over and over and over and over and over and over.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:09</a>:</strong>  Once it gets to 18% humidity, then the mold goes woo hoo and it blooms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:25:09">0:25:09-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  That's also when, if you have a biodegradable material, that's also when biodegradation begins.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:19</a>:</strong>  But you don't have a biodegradable material if you have a mass material generally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:25:19">0:25:19-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  If you have a cob wall between heat is there and cold, you will have that problem with the period.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:48</a>:</strong>  If you bring that cob wall inside, or adobe or whatever the mass is, you bring it to the inside of your face, and then have an envelope, have another wall system, whether it's glass or insulation or whatever, between you and the outside, then you prevent that from happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  That's what I understand really well. The only part of my question that I didn't understand was, is there a risk of the freezing water inside of the walls actually expanding and eroding the material?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:26:02">0:26:02-0:26:31</a>:</strong>  Oh, well yeah, excellent question. Yes, so water is the only thing that's larger than the solid than the liquid. So if you have a situation where massive amounts of water can get inside, it probably wouldn't happen just from humidity, but if you had massive amounts of water that got inside of a clay wall system, and then that wall system froze,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:26:31">0:26:31-0:26:54</a>:</strong>  then the liquid expands and it sort of explodes the clay apart from the inside, and it breaks all of the little suction cups. The clay is sticky with these little suction cup platelets, and that water freezing and expanding tops apart those little suction cups, and it becomes weaker and weaker over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:26:54">0:26:54-0:27:07</a>:</strong>  And sometimes that can happen from one freeze event. If you had something like a clay oven and you didn't protect it in winter and it got popping wet and then froze, it could be rebuilding in the next spring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:27:07">0:27:07-0:27:09</a>:</strong>  There you go, that answers my question perfectly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:27:09">0:27:09-0:27:14</a>:</strong>  The whole wall system would take longer. Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:27:14">0:27:14-0:27:25</a>:</strong>  Now, what insulative materials do you recommend to people who can't get straw bales, or if they're too expensive, wherever they might live?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:27:25">0:27:25-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so I'm a big proponent of first figure out what your climate is and figure out, okay, would I do that with an insulation material, a mass material, or both?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  Right, so a pure shaded mass material would be great for a hot climate, so when you were talking about being passively comfortable. If you lived in a hot climate and you had clay walls of some kind, or stone, or adobe, or whatever mass material is available to,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:28:02</a>:</strong>  and you shaded those walls so that the sun didn't hit them, then you're constantly cooling your space. It's like a wall system that's an air conditioner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:28:02">0:28:02-0:28:08</a>:</strong>  But whether you're trying to heat or cool, so whether you're trying to do insulation or a thermal mass, depends on the climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:28:08">0:28:08-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  So know your climate first and then figure out what kind of material do I need for which application.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:22</a>:</strong>  And then figure out, okay, so I need insulating or acid stones because I live somewhere where I'm definitely going to have to eat in winter time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:28:22">0:28:22-0:28:38</a>:</strong>  What do I have available to me? So insulators would include, sort of in the natural building world, the top ones are either some kind of agricultural fiber, so draw from any kind of grain harvesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:28:38">0:28:38-0:28:47</a>:</strong>  You could use hay, although hay also has to do with animal food, so if you have something else available, there's probably a higher need for that hay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:28:47">0:28:47-0:28:58</a>:</strong>  But hay works fine. Wood is a reasonable insulator. You could use less straw, so if straw was really expensive, but you could get some.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:28:58">0:28:58-0:29:10</a>:</strong>  You could coat the straw with just a little bit of clay and make a thinner wall. So you would use less straw-less wood if you did straw-billed, and that's called light clay straw or light straw.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:29:10">0:29:10-0:29:29</a>:</strong>  Light clay. And then there are things, so hemp would be another agricultural product that is a great insulator that was often added with lime to make something called coxley, which is a great insulator.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:29:29">0:29:29-0:29:50</a>:</strong>  And then wood has a moderate insulation value, especially if you are sideways into the grain. So there's a method for building called cordwood, so if you have wood really readily available and you have clay, you could use clay to make a mortar, and you could build cordwood walls and those would be insulating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:29:50">0:29:50-0:30:02</a>:</strong>  And then there's things like wool, which you don't think of, but you know, we wear wool sweaters in the winter carvings because it's a really good insulator because it tracks little air pockets and it does it whether it's wet or dry, so it's a pretty good one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:30:02">0:30:02-0:30:10</a>:</strong>  And then there are purchasable products, but those tend to be more expensive, things like recycled cotton, you know, things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:30:10">0:30:10-0:30:32</a>:</strong>  Can you explain to me with all these different types of insulative materials, especially in the case of cordwood, when you're fitting these things together, either with mortar or with some other kind of binder, is there a risk of having a thermal bridge that would compromise the insulative properties of the other material you're using?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:30:32">0:30:32-0:30:50</a>:</strong>  Ah, that's such a good question. So the mortar, with cordwood, the mortar doesn't go all the way through the wall system. You have mortar on the inside, mortar on the outside, and then some other insulator material, usually it's sawdust, so there's no thermal bridge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:30:50">0:30:50-0:31:06</a>:</strong>  And if you keep the mortar to the inside and the outside, yeah, yeah, and that way you don't, the mortar would bridge it, the mortar would be a mass material that conducted temperature much more quickly, right in between each piece of wood and then every point would.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:31:06">0:31:06-0:31:26</a>:</strong>  But if you put that insulation in between the sides. Okay, now for a much more minimal form of mortar, I know that some people are in favor of dipping straw bales in clay slip before they assemble their walls. Is there any risk of having a thermal bridge with an application of clay that small?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:31:26">0:31:26-0:31:42</a>:</strong>  So there's two ways that people use this slip. So one is to dip the face of the bale in clay slip so that when you go to plaster you already have a coating of clay on the face of the bale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:31:42">0:31:42-0:31:48</a>:</strong>  And the other is when you dip it where the two bales are going to meet, and I would never do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:31:48">0:31:48-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  So two things, one is you're introducing quite a bit of moisture right into the middle of your wall, and that is the most difficult place for the wall to dry out, for a straw bale wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:03</a>:</strong>  Straw bale walls are either 18 inches thick or 20 inches thick. They're really, really deep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:32:03">0:32:03-0:32:13</a>:</strong>  And so the water that, if you come in four inches from either perimeter, the inside of the bale wall has a very hard time drying out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:32:13">0:32:13-0:32:22</a>:</strong>  The outside can dry out, but the inside can't. And so to add something wet right into the center to me is a little better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:32:22">0:32:22-0:32:28</a>:</strong>  Because, you know, if it gets up to 18% moisture, you're rotting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:32:28">0:32:28-0:32:38</a>:</strong>  So to me, why would you introduce that? And if the math matures. So it's a teeny tiny thermal bridge, but it is still a thermal bridge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:32:38">0:32:38-0:32:44</a>:</strong>  So I would not, I wouldn't do it. There's not really a reason to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:32:44">0:32:44-0:32:52</a>:</strong>  Thank you, that answers a completely separate question that I had from earlier, but thank you for sorting that out too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:32:58</a>:</strong>  Now that acts as a good way for me to kind of switch gears here. Let's talk a little bit about finishes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:32:58">0:32:58-0:33:05</a>:</strong>  What are some of your favorite additives to plaster to sort of enhance their properties?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:33:05">0:33:05-0:33:10</a>:</strong>  Well, so first of all, my favorite favorite plaster is clay plaster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:33:10">0:33:10-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  So I use two kinds of plaster generally. I use clay plaster and I use lime plaster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:21</a>:</strong>  And the reason to use lime over clay is because you need the durability.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:27</a>:</strong>  So you need the weather resistance and you need erosion control.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:33:27">0:33:27-0:33:42</a>:</strong>  You have, we have a really wet climate and you could do clay outside, but you would probably be either looking at really deep root programing so that the rain doesn't regularly hit the walls.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:33:42">0:33:42-0:33:47</a>:</strong>  Or you're going to be re-plastering periodically. Most people don't want that to be needed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:33:47">0:33:47-0:33:58</a>:</strong>  So my first clarification would be that I do use lime plaster where you need something harder. Lime plaster turns into literally limestone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:33:58">0:33:58-0:34:02</a>:</strong>  So you're plastering onto your walls and it's pretty durable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:34:02">0:34:02-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  But then there's ways to create clay plasters which I use whenever possible because you can cut them and play with them with your hands and get totally muddy and it's super fun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:22</a>:</strong>  And kids can do it and any age person and it doesn't matter your skill level, you can be productive with clay plasters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:34:22">0:34:22-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  So I find them to be just super forgiving, super versatile. You can get different colors, you can get different textures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  I mean, there's just there's really no and I've been doing it for 20 years and I still learn all the time with clay plasters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  So my favorite attitude that I use here is cow dung.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  And the reason is that because of the digestive system of the cow, they release an enzyme into their poop that makes, it increases plasticity of the plaster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:02">0:35:02-0:35:11</a>:</strong>  Plasticity is when you take a trowel and you run the trowel over the plaster and you're spreading it onto the wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:11">0:35:11-0:35:18</a>:</strong>  It spreads more like whipped cream cheese as opposed to cold butter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:18">0:35:18-0:35:31</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it really does. I know it sounds gross to use that, but if you've ever tried the difference between just a pure clay plaster and one with additive dung, sometimes horse dung too, it's awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:31">0:35:31-0:35:38</a>:</strong>  I agree. Yeah. So the difference with horse dung is horse dung is adding fiber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:38">0:35:38-0:35:42</a>:</strong>  So remember when you asked, OK, what would you use if you couldn't have straw bales?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:42">0:35:42-0:35:48</a>:</strong>  Like let's say you needed fiber in your clay plaster, but you had no fiber, no plant material available to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:48">0:35:48-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  You could use horse dung because they basically pooped the grass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's exactly what we used when I worked in Africa and there was very little vegetation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:35:57">0:35:57-0:36:07</a>:</strong>  It was mostly a desert climate. And the one thing that we had was a bountiful amount of horse dung and it really saved us the blasters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:36:07">0:36:07-0:36:13</a>:</strong>  That's awesome. Yeah. So the cow poop though has an enzyme.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  And what that enzyme does besides the plasticity is it makes the plaster when it hardens, it's harder as a plaster, like compressive strength, and it's more resistant to water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:46</a>:</strong>  So if you had a situation where you needed to be able to scrub the wall on a regular basis, like a commercial kitchen or something like that, I'll probably get fired from my job if I say cow dung in a commercial kitchen class.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:36:46">0:36:46-0:37:01</a>:</strong>  If you know, you know what I mean, like if you need to be able to scrub that wall. Yeah. If you need to be able to scrub that, boy, cow dung makes it really, really durable and scrubable and hard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:37:01">0:37:01-0:37:07</a>:</strong>  It also polishes the immensions when you add cow dung. I mean it's like a magical ingredient.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:37:07">0:37:07-0:37:14</a>:</strong>  And if you get it wet right out of the cow, I mean, you know we were going to talk about poop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:37:14">0:37:14-0:37:19</a>:</strong>  Oh I knew we were going to talk about poop. I knew what I was talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:37:19">0:37:19-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  If you can get it fresh, it has the most amount of active enzyme in it right out of the gate. But if you have dried, if you have only access to dried poop, what you can do is ferment it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:43</a>:</strong>  So you just put it in there and mix it, rehydrate it with water, and then let it sit for a week. And it will basically be the enzyme probe. Right? Like an active culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:37:43">0:37:43-0:37:56</a>:</strong>  And it's not for the faint of heart, like as well as the worst. If you're just getting started with plasters, fermenting cow dung is really jumping in the deep end. It really does work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:37:56">0:37:56-0:38:03</a>:</strong>  But it's unsavory for a lot of people that I've worked with on workshops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:03">0:38:03-0:38:18</a>:</strong>  So every time I've used it though, there's sort of that resistance at first. So if you use a plaster that doesn't have the cow dung first, and then do a bath where you mix in the cow dung, and there's always like giggles and haha and I can't believe we're doing this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:18">0:38:18-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  And then people plaster with it. And to a person, they're like, oh my god this is so much nicer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:24</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:24">0:38:24-0:38:34</a>:</strong>  To a person. Yeah. Yeah. So it's really mental. It's not, it doesn't stink. It's not, you know, you don't feel any clean at the end. Well, muddy regardless.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:34">0:38:34-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  You do want to wash your hands at the end.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:41</a>:</strong>  You do want to wash before lunch. Yeah, yeah. That's definitely true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:41">0:38:41-0:38:49</a>:</strong>  One of the main things you know for the people who are squeamish about it is, give it a couple of days and once it dries, you will never smell that stuff again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:49">0:38:49-0:38:53</a>:</strong>  No. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:38:53">0:38:53-0:39:00</a>:</strong>  So it's almost stinky for a couple of days, but if you can get past that point, it's totally worth the hassle. Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:39:00">0:39:00-0:39:05</a>:</strong>  Definitely worth the hassle. Yeah, that's my favorite additive by far.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:39:05">0:39:05-0:39:18</a>:</strong>  And for floors as well. So the original African earthen floors were made with their soil, which is plain, and cow dung or oxen dung or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:39:18">0:39:18-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  And they would flood the floors and then use when they dry, this is going to really go down to deep end now, they would use cow urine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:37</a>:</strong>  I don't know how they collected it, but they did. To seal the floor. And they're like polished concrete, but beautiful. Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:39:37">0:39:37-0:39:43</a>:</strong>  I think they're really hard. They're really durable and gorgeous. Gorgeous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:39:43">0:39:43-0:39:50</a>:</strong>  And there are some that are polished with ox blood as well. The proteins in the blood are really hard. Oh yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  Because the proteins, yeah exactly. Yeah. Yeah, they were way ahead on that. But I don't bleed the cow urine. I can't do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:40:03</a>:</strong>  Well the thing is, you can collect urine for a long time, but you can bleed the cow only once.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:40:03">0:40:03-0:40:15</a>:</strong>  Oh yes, this is true. Which is one thing to consider if you only have one cow. That's a big consideration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:40:15">0:40:15-0:40:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah, since we're all about sustainability. Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:40:20">0:40:20-0:40:27</a>:</strong>  Okay, for the five people who are still listening here, I do have one more question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:40:27">0:40:27-0:40:34</a>:</strong>  You said we didn't lose it to talk about cow food. Yeah, there's a couple of hardcore people who are still with us here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:40:34">0:40:34-0:40:44</a>:</strong>  Okay, so a little bit more on plasters. How do you reduce the chance of finishers splitting or pulling away from points where they meet wood or other non-earthen materials?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:40:44">0:40:44-0:40:50</a>:</strong>  Now this is one of the things that I see, even with people who are really experienced plasters, who really have their mixes down,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:40:50">0:40:50-0:41:00</a>:</strong>  this is often one of the weak points or one of the few things that I see in earthen structures that seems to be common just about everywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:41:00">0:41:00-0:41:09</a>:</strong>  Do you have a trick for stopping these plasters from splitting away from these points?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:41:09">0:41:09-0:41:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so it starts with your subtrees. It starts with what are you plastering onto. And if what you're plastering onto is still shrinking or moving or compressing in any way,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:41:25">0:41:25-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  then by nature your plastering is going to move with it. So for example, if you built a straw bale wall and the bales aren't super tight,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:43</a>:</strong>  and you put this really heavy plaster on, right? Plaster weighs, for every inch of thickness, it weighs 17 pounds per foot. It's really heavy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:41:43">0:41:43-0:41:50</a>:</strong>  But you're basically loading up that straw bale wall with a lot of weight and it will pull the wall down if you didn't pack it tight.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:41:50">0:41:50-0:42:03</a>:</strong>  And if it pulls down, you're going to get gaffed, right? So the first thing to know is what is the substrate, how tight is it, and was it well prepared ahead of time?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:42:03">0:42:03-0:42:17</a>:</strong>  And then the second thing would be to apply your plaster in layers. So for example, if you didn't pack your straw bale tight and you put your plaster on and it all pulled away because the wall shrank a little bit,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:42:17">0:42:17-0:42:30</a>:</strong>  okay, fill that gap in before you continue. Because if you have a crack, whether it's on the perimeter or whether it's in the field of your wall,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:42:30">0:42:30-0:42:37</a>:</strong>  it is highly probable that that crack is going to be every single layer of plaster that you put over it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:42:37">0:42:37-0:42:42</a>:</strong>  It's going to just be great. So address all of the cracks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:42:42">0:42:42-0:42:50</a>:</strong>  Then the second thing I would look at is reinforcing the plaster. So what I mean by that is just extra fiber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:42:50">0:42:50-0:43:09</a>:</strong>  So if anywhere that you have a place on the wall where you think might be crack prone, and that would be joints between two dissimilar materials, for example, every single edge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:43:09">0:43:09-0:43:26</a>:</strong>  It would be around windows because the windows tend to have to stay rigid through glass and if the wall moves at all from wind or just general movement of the buildings, you may get crack lines that go on a 45 degree angle off of each corner of a window frame.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:43:26">0:43:26-0:43:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's often where I see them as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:43:28">0:43:28-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  So if you, yeah, exactly. So if you preemptively know, hey, I'm probably going to get a crack there, then put more fiber there. So what I mean is, if it's a plaster, add as much straw into your plaster as you possibly can to bridge those areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:59</a>:</strong>  Or, and or use mesh. And that mesh can be either something that you purchase like a plastic or fiberglass mesh, or it can be burlap, which works great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:43:59">0:43:59-0:44:16</a>:</strong>  And you would apply that right into the wet plaster. So you plaster on, and then you put your burlap almost like drywall tape, right, where you put the tape in between the seams of the drywall because you know if there's a movement in the house there will be a crack at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:44:16">0:44:16-0:44:30</a>:</strong>  And you put a little bit of drywall tape between the joints of the drywall and you don't want to see that. So they put tape there. It's the same idea. So at the top of the wall, where you have, where your wall meets the ceiling, I put drywall tape there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:44:30">0:44:30-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  Or mesh at some time so that it bridges the ceiling to the wall so that you don't get a crack along the top.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:44:39">0:44:39-0:44:48</a>:</strong>  Along all of those corners, I will put a strip of burlap or strip of some kind of mesh to protect that and extra straw in all of the plasters for those areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:44:48">0:44:48-0:44:54</a>:</strong>  And then the third most critical thing that is the easiest to forget is impressions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:44:54">0:44:54-0:45:17</a>:</strong>  So, and I do this with cob as well. If you have a cob wall that's meeting a wood column, for example. But same with plaster. You compress your clay into the material that it's meeting, into the wood post or whatever it is. Compress it right at that corner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:45:17">0:45:17-0:45:28</a>:</strong>  Not just when you're plastering, but as it gets leather hard, compress it again. And you may do it even a third time or a fourth time. So I would just check it every day. Compress, compress, compress, compress into that spot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:45:28">0:45:28-0:45:40</a>:</strong>  Because what can happen is if you have a clay rich plaster, it is shrinking as it dries because the clay is larger when it's wet than when it's dry. Like literally larger volume.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:45:40">0:45:40-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  Because it's absorbed all that water into the platelet. And so as it releases the water, it shrinks. And if you don't have enough other ingredients, hands, straw, you know, or a fiber or whatever the fiber is in general, then the clay shrinks enough to actually pull away from the edges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:46:13</a>:</strong>  So you're trying to mitigate that. So adding fiber, using tape, and by that I mean sort of tape as a global thing. So that could be burlap, which is probably my favorite go-to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:46:13">0:46:13-0:46:24</a>:</strong>  And compression would be the top three things to do. And I try to keep the before you finish plaster, make sure you don't have cracks in the wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:46:24">0:46:24-0:46:32</a>:</strong>  And fix every crack in the wall before you finish the plaster. Make sure it's no longer shrinking or moving away from the edges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:46:32">0:46:32-0:46:49</a>:</strong>  And there's another, there's a tool you can use for this. And it's called a margin trowel. So if you do all of your edges using a margin trowel, and it's basically, it looks like, the US version is sort of like a rectangle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:46:49">0:46:49-0:47:01</a>:</strong>  It's an inch wide, maybe three or four inches long. And the handle goes up off of the flat part so that you can push flat against the wall, right against all the edges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:01">0:47:01-0:47:10</a>:</strong>  And then there's this really sporty Japanese version of that that's sort of a little more pointed. So it lets you get into really neat areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:10">0:47:10-0:47:17</a>:</strong>  And the book that Landerland tells us, Landerland.com, that's the term she tells the Japanese. They're spectacular.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:17">0:47:17-0:47:26</a>:</strong>  And I gotta put that on my wish list. I've mostly worked with trowels and stuff that I've made myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:26">0:47:26-0:47:31</a>:</strong>  I feel like I'll get some kind of little touch-based tools.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:31">0:47:31-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's a whole addiction right there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:43</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah. Anybody who's into construction or building anything, tools are, you know, that's like kid in a candy shop type stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:43">0:47:43-0:47:51</a>:</strong>  If I go into a hardware store, if I go through somebody's tool library, yeah, that's the best.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:51">0:47:51-0:47:53</a>:</strong>  So I got a new one for my list now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:53">0:47:53-0:47:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah, but good for you for making them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:56">0:47:56-0:47:58</a>:</strong>  You got a new one what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:47:58">0:47:58-0:48:02</a>:</strong>  I've got a new wish list now, a new item for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:02">0:48:02-0:48:04</a>:</strong>  Excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:04">0:48:04-0:48:13</a>:</strong>  I'll put a link and maybe some pictures on the show notes as well so that people can find or at least understand what type of trowel that you're looking forward to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:13">0:48:13-0:48:16</a>:</strong>  Oh, that would be awesome. Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:16">0:48:16-0:48:25</a>:</strong>  Now, you're talking about filling these cracks mostly along the edges, especially with earthen walls, depending on how good of a job you do trimming them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:25">0:48:25-0:48:28</a>:</strong>  I know it can vary, especially in workshops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:28">0:48:28-0:48:36</a>:</strong>  Your walls are kind of undulating and a lot of people want to try and fill in those gaps and make their walls smoother.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:36">0:48:36-0:48:47</a>:</strong>  What kind of, I guess, scratch coat plaster would you recommend to fill in those gaps so that by the time you're putting in your finished coat, you have so much less work to do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:47">0:48:47-0:48:55</a>:</strong>  Oh, that's a great question. And that actually comes up with straw bale walls too, because no matter how beautifully you trim them, they're never perfect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:55">0:48:55-0:48:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah, sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:56">0:48:56-0:48:58</a>:</strong>  They're not filling gaps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:48:58">0:48:58-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so I think of it as a, on straw bale it's a three-part system and on cob wall it's a two-part system, because the cob is your part one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:22</a>:</strong>  So with straw, the first coat is that you're trying to get a really good bond between clay and the straw and it can be really thin and it can be fairly clay-risked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:49:22">0:49:22-0:49:26</a>:</strong>  And you're working it into the straw to get a really good bond.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:49:26">0:49:26-0:49:35</a>:</strong>  So the 100% goal of the first coat on straw bale specifically is to attach to the straw really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:49:35">0:49:35-0:49:46</a>:</strong>  And so a straw bale wall with a first coat to me would be the equivalent of that cob wall that you just asked about where you have some undulation in the clay that you want to fill in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:49:46">0:49:46-0:50:11</a>:</strong>  So in either case, then the second piece is a clay plaster that has some sand in it, because the sand increases compression strength and it decreases shrinkage, because sand, when we talked about clay being larger in volume when it's wet and smaller in volume when it's dry,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:50:11">0:50:11-0:50:22</a>:</strong>  sand is the same volume when it's wet or dry. So the sand is not shrinking and the more sand you have, the more shrinkage you have in the plaster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:50:22">0:50:22-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  And then you're making up the difference with a lot of copper.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:32</a>:</strong>  So we are in straw ubiquitous and inexpensive, so it tends to be straw.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:50:32">0:50:32-0:50:43</a>:</strong>  And I run it through like a leaf mulcher. One time for that coat and two times if I need a really fine, you know if I need shorter fibers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:50:43">0:50:43-0:51:01</a>:</strong>  You run it through a leaf mulcher, you end up with pieces that are that vary from maybe half an inch to two or three inches long, so kind of in that range, and add like as much straw as your plaster can handle and still be sticky to go on the wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  And the reasoning, the fiber, when we were just talking about controlling crack, I mean and all that, the fiber that you put is sort of like internal armature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:21</a>:</strong>  It will bridge cracks and it will allow you to put the wall in one path.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:51:21">0:51:21-0:51:32</a>:</strong>  So I've done up to, see I did a wall last week where I put five inches on the part of the wall, which would be kind of weird.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:51:32">0:51:32-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  Because it had so much straw in it, it draws almost like an internal control that makes all of the clay act as one whole mass instead of sheets of mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:52:11</a>:</strong>  And so it tends to stay on the wall. And that lets you build up all kinds of uneven thicknesses without shrinking, without cracking, and really level out your wall and make sure that the wall is exactly the shape you want it to be before you do your finished plaster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:52:11">0:52:11-0:52:23</a>:</strong>  Because finished plasters use the same thickness all the way across. So you're going to get uneven drying, and when you're drying you're going to get cracks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:52:23">0:52:23-0:52:36</a>:</strong>  Man I really could use that information when I was first starting out. I made so many mistakes trying to apply finished plaster in ways to try and get rid of some undulations when I was first starting out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:52:36">0:52:36-0:52:41</a>:</strong>  Man I hope that helps other people to avoid my earlier mistakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:52:41">0:52:41-0:52:54</a>:</strong>  Well and fair enough, but you know what I think is actually beautiful is to give yourself permission to make those mistakes because that's exactly how you learn. And I've made them and you've made them and everybody else who's ever been in a natural building has made them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:52:54">0:52:54-0:52:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah in a natural building they can be really fun too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:52:58">0:52:58-0:52:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:52:59">0:52:59-0:53:02</a>:</strong>  I've made some very common mistakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:02">0:53:02-0:53:06</a>:</strong>  Yes right, then you can use them to your advantage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:06">0:53:06-0:53:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:08">0:53:08-0:53:12</a>:</strong>  And if not at least for the laughs of others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:12">0:53:12-0:53:13</a>:</strong>  Right, right exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:13">0:53:13-0:53:15</a>:</strong>  They make for good stories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:15">0:53:15-0:53:16</a>:</strong>  Hey so before I let you go here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:16">0:53:16-0:53:18</a>:</strong>  They do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:18">0:53:18-0:53:20</a>:</strong>  No go ahead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:20">0:53:20-0:53:22</a>:</strong>  No that's, go ahead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:22">0:53:22-0:53:33</a>:</strong>  Before I let you go. How can people get in touch with you in order to learn more about you and to see more of your work?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:33">0:53:33-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  Probably the best place would be my website which is buildnaturally.com and if anyone's on Facebook I do have a Facebook page where I post stuff every day and I try to answer every question that Facebook lets me meet. And that is the Facebook page is buildnaturally.com.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:54:01</a>:</strong>  And do you have any workshops or classes coming up?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:54:01">0:54:01-0:54:04</a>:</strong>  Oh yes I do and thanks for asking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:54:04">0:54:04-0:54:14</a>:</strong>  I have, let's see, five clay building workshops coming up in Maryland in March and April.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:54:14">0:54:14-0:54:20</a>:</strong>  And then I have an outdoor kitchen where we're going to build a clay oven and a little rocket grill.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:54:20">0:54:20-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  Build a stone wall with clay mortar and a bunch of other fun stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:36</a>:</strong>  And then the Cadillac workshop and the polish line plasters that we polish with polyglots.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:54:36">0:54:36-0:54:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah that sounds wonderful. I'm going to have to ask you more about that on a future episode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-episode-007-sigi-koko/#t=0:54:40">0:54:40-0:54:42</a>:</strong>  Title act is really interesting stuff.<br />
