<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=0:59:59">0:59:59-1:00:01</a>:</strong>  And it may be just six shrubs.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:06">1:01:06-1:01:07</a>:</strong>  tree and fruiting shrubs.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/11-inspiring-examples-to-give-you-hope-that-the-worlds-forests-can-be-regenerated/#t=1:01:41">1:01:41-1:01:47</a>:</strong>  in two years, the plants that really are happy and I like to say happy because a plant that's<br />
