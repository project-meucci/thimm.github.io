<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:36">0:02:36-0:02:40</a>:</strong>  As I continue to explore the topics of natural building and ecological design in this ongoing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:40">0:02:40-0:02:44</a>:</strong>  series, I had the pleasure of speaking again with Mark Lakeman.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:44">0:02:44-0:02:48</a>:</strong>  Now, Mark has been a big inspiration to me through the architectural work that he's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:48">0:02:48-0:02:52</a>:</strong>  done at the community level and in exploring what it takes to design neighborhoods and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:52">0:02:52-0:02:57</a>:</strong>  gathering places that help humans to reconnect to their sense of place and overcome the colonial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:02:57">0:02:57-0:03:02</a>:</strong>  infrastructure that continues to separate us from each other and from lifestyles that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:02">0:03:02-0:03:05</a>:</strong>  include all the facets of healthy living.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:05">0:03:05-0:03:09</a>:</strong>  Since I've mostly studied design at the building level, learning about ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:09">0:03:09-0:03:14</a>:</strong>  and life enhancing ways of designing the infrastructure around us has been very eye opening to me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:14">0:03:14-0:03:19</a>:</strong>  as I start to consider the larger impact that our built environment has on the way that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:19">0:03:19-0:03:22</a>:</strong>  we live and how our cultures are shaped.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:22">0:03:22-0:03:27</a>:</strong>  Now in this episode, we take more of a philosophical approach to design than in previous interviews<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:27">0:03:27-0:03:30</a>:</strong>  where I focus mostly on techniques and methodologies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:30">0:03:30-0:03:36</a>:</strong>  Here Mark speaks in detail about how, especially in North America and other colonized regions,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:36">0:03:36-0:03:41</a>:</strong>  we operate in communities that were designed for efficiency and expansion rather than the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:41">0:03:41-0:03:43</a>:</strong>  health of the inhabitants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:43">0:03:43-0:03:48</a>:</strong>  As a result, even the basic grid of our streets and the zoning separation between commercial,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:48">0:03:48-0:03:54</a>:</strong>  residential and industrial areas creates the lifestyles where all functions are separated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:54">0:03:54-0:03:55</a>:</strong>  and impersonal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:55">0:03:55-0:03:59</a>:</strong>  One of my favorite enduring quotes of Mark's from a TED talk that he gave a while back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:03:59">0:03:59-0:04:00</a>:</strong>  is,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:00">0:04:00-0:04:03</a>:</strong>  What good is our right to assembly without any place to assemble?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:03">0:04:03-0:04:07</a>:</strong>  And in turn we talk about some of the many projects that he and his teams have worked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  on to bring places of gathering and assembly back into disconnected neighborhoods and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:12">0:04:12-0:04:16</a>:</strong>  uphill battle they face in navigating the bureaucracies and regulatory bodies that make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:16">0:04:16-0:04:20</a>:</strong>  it difficult for people to contribute to public spaces.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:20">0:04:20-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  We also explore ideas on how to renovate and rejuvenate our community infrastructure to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:24">0:04:24-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  reclaim our space and in turn become people of place once more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:32</a>:</strong>  This is a thoughtful interview that links in with other conversations that I've published<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:32">0:04:32-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  in the past, so I've put links to the other interviews that we reference in the show notes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:41</a>:</strong>  for this episode, including the original conversation that I had with Mark and his colleague Riddi<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:41">0:04:41-0:04:44</a>:</strong>  D'Cruz from a previous season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:44">0:04:44-0:04:48</a>:</strong>  If you'd like to go back and hear more about Mark's background and how he started in community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:48">0:04:48-0:04:54</a>:</strong>  architecture, but rather than giving everything away, I'll turn things over now to Mark.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:54">0:04:54-0:04:57</a>:</strong>  Hey, Mark, thanks so much for taking the time to be with me here today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:57">0:04:57-0:04:58</a>:</strong>  How are you doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:04:58">0:04:58-0:05:00</a>:</strong>  I'm doing great, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:00">0:05:00-0:05:03</a>:</strong>  Thanks for getting together like this to share some stories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's such a pleasure to be able to catch up with you again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:11</a>:</strong>  Now it was almost say about two years ago since I spoke with you and your colleague<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:11">0:05:11-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  Riddi D'Cruz.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:18</a>:</strong>  So if anybody's interested in hearing more about your background or hearing some perspectives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:18">0:05:18-0:05:22</a>:</strong>  from Riddi from your team with City Repair Project, they can go back to that original<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:22">0:05:22-0:05:27</a>:</strong>  interview and I'll put links to that in the show notes for this podcast episode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:27">0:05:27-0:05:34</a>:</strong>  So let's jump past the background information and talk a little bit about the impact that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:34">0:05:34-0:05:40</a>:</strong>  civic planning and architecture can have on our lives and how it can affect the way that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  we interact or disconnect with our communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:45</a>:</strong>  That's exciting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:45">0:05:45-0:05:47</a>:</strong>  I live for this conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:47">0:05:47-0:05:51</a>:</strong>  Okay, well, would you like me to just kind of just start generally then?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:51">0:05:51-0:05:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah, go ahead and just kind of give me an idea of how you see those topics because I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:05:55">0:05:55-0:06:00</a>:</strong>  know that this is the world in which you work with kind of on a full time basis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:00">0:06:00-0:06:01</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:01">0:06:01-0:06:09</a>:</strong>  Well, I think I'm I think I'm always finding myself navigating kind of different paradigms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:09">0:06:09-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  of seeing, I think, like a lot of constructive activists, they have this reference in what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:24</a>:</strong>  they think or what they feel is an essential human way of being or essential human condition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:24">0:06:24-0:06:30</a>:</strong>  And I think that might for a lot of people that probably boils down into a kind of a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:30">0:06:30-0:06:37</a>:</strong>  democratic or anarchistic sense like that you should be able to participate and have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:37">0:06:37-0:06:44</a>:</strong>  a voice should be able to affect your environment pretty directly and not be too encumbered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:44">0:06:44-0:06:49</a>:</strong>  by bureaucracy or needing to be part of a culture that has to ask permission.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:49">0:06:49-0:06:57</a>:</strong>  For me, as an architect and planner, my reference is to kind of have a historical perspective<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:06:57">0:06:57-0:07:05</a>:</strong>  and look at kind of over the sweep of time at sort of village cultures that have emerged<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:05">0:07:05-0:07:11</a>:</strong>  around the planet over time and understand that as place based communities, they were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:11">0:07:11-0:07:18</a>:</strong>  able to really directly affect their environment in fact to transform or alchemize their environment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:18">0:07:18-0:07:23</a>:</strong>  into a, you know, urban forms and agricultural systems without having without even being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:23">0:07:23-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  able to, or maybe even wanting to import a lot from outside of their bioregions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:36</a>:</strong>  So my reference point is that the majority of human history, people have been working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:36">0:07:36-0:07:44</a>:</strong>  within bioregional frameworks to create the systems and the structures that they inhabit,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:44">0:07:44-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  the social systems, the architecture, the village forms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:54</a>:</strong>  And as opposed to that, which would, you know, let me just say more about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:07:54">0:07:54-0:08:00</a>:</strong>  I mean, in that context, you would presume that people are able to express themselves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:00">0:08:00-0:08:04</a>:</strong>  and as they're meeting their needs, they're solving problems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:08</a>:</strong>  And as they're doing that, they're building their community because they're solving problems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:08">0:08:08-0:08:09</a>:</strong>  together and meeting their needs together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:09">0:08:09-0:08:16</a>:</strong>  So they, you know, develop stronger linkages and relationships with each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:16">0:08:16-0:08:20</a>:</strong>  I think a lot of people in their sense of how the world should be, it's kind of based<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:20">0:08:20-0:08:26</a>:</strong>  on a sense that that's been our history, but also that we're biologically wired to feel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:26">0:08:26-0:08:30</a>:</strong>  that that is righteous and that is the way that we should live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:30">0:08:30-0:08:32</a>:</strong>  I feel that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:32">0:08:32-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  So I bring that into my work within the modern city, in the modern world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:45</a>:</strong>  And you know, I'm constantly interfacing with systems that are really set up to serve development<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:45">0:08:45-0:08:53</a>:</strong>  interests, you know, that someone can engage the land and other human beings more from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:08:53">0:08:53-0:09:01</a>:</strong>  a profit motive point of view, and then create landscapes that serve their desire for a return<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:01">0:09:01-0:09:07</a>:</strong>  as opposed to the people living there, you know, creating something that helps them meet<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:07">0:09:07-0:09:08</a>:</strong>  their needs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:08">0:09:08-0:09:14</a>:</strong>  Instead, a lot of this, in my opinion, ends up being a kind of an artifice that looks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:14">0:09:14-0:09:20</a>:</strong>  and works a lot like how we would like to create landscapes, except in the end, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:20">0:09:20-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  result isn't to build community, but more, you know, maybe to build someone's bank account.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:33</a>:</strong>  So I live in that spectrum, that disparity spectrum between how I think I would like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:33">0:09:33-0:09:38</a>:</strong>  to live in the world, and then the world that we're living in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:38">0:09:38-0:09:47</a>:</strong>  And I navigate between those poles, trying to figure out ways to elicit and re-express,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:47">0:09:47-0:09:55</a>:</strong>  re-emerge, help to re-emerge ways for people to participate and create and connect with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:55">0:09:55-0:09:56</a>:</strong>  each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:09:56">0:09:56-0:10:02</a>:</strong>  And I try to sort of, you know, work with human beings within the system who also feel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:02">0:10:02-0:10:09</a>:</strong>  this way, even if they're bureaucrats, to humanize and temper the bureaucratic and profit-oriented<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:09">0:10:09-0:10:16</a>:</strong>  structures that we find ourselves in, in order to help create more just relationships and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:16">0:10:16-0:10:19</a>:</strong>  designs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:19">0:10:19-0:10:22</a>:</strong>  So I think that's an overarching partial answer there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:22">0:10:22-0:10:25</a>:</strong>  No, that's a really good way of putting it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:25">0:10:25-0:10:29</a>:</strong>  But it always leads me to this question when people have kind of a vision for what they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:29">0:10:29-0:10:31</a>:</strong>  want to achieve.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:31">0:10:31-0:10:37</a>:</strong>  I'm interested in knowing what you use as reference for healthy infrastructure and civic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:37">0:10:37-0:10:43</a>:</strong>  planning or community infrastructure that facilitates connectivity and that ability<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  to kind of influence in a healthy way, the way that you interact with the people in your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:10:50</a>:</strong>  daily life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:50">0:10:50-0:10:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I've got a really practical answer to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:10:54">0:10:54-0:11:05</a>:</strong>  Well, yeah, so here we are living in the USA, and about 20 years ago or 25 years ago in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:05">0:11:05-0:11:12</a>:</strong>  my career, I came back from a series of kind of cultural immersions where I was basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:12">0:11:12-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  out asking different communities and cultures around the world what they could see about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:24</a>:</strong>  the USA and what they could also see about me and what they would advise me and us to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:24">0:11:24-0:11:30</a>:</strong>  do about our condition because obviously there's massive challenges that we have here like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:30">0:11:30-0:11:37</a>:</strong>  you know, across the spectrum of so-called prime, we sometimes have these statistics<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:37">0:11:37-0:11:42</a>:</strong>  that are 10 times more distressing than other cultures that are related to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:42">0:11:42-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  The answer that I got back was basically to notice, when I got home, to notice that we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:55</a>:</strong>  all live in this colonial infrastructure that is an expression of participation at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:12:00</a>:</strong>  It's really designed as a development mechanism, and the practical simple answer to your question<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:00">0:12:00-0:12:06</a>:</strong>  is to look around and notice that there's almost no public squares in any neighborhood<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:06">0:12:06-0:12:09</a>:</strong>  across the entire country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:09">0:12:09-0:12:14</a>:</strong>  And to understand, you know, the advice I got was to understand that there's this really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:14">0:12:14-0:12:21</a>:</strong>  terrible, terrible, like horrific absence in our midst, that we actually have to travel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:21">0:12:21-0:12:28</a>:</strong>  across the ocean to visit villages where, you know, living and working is in close proximity,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:28">0:12:28-0:12:34</a>:</strong>  not zoned like American cities are where you have to transit the landscape to go and earn<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:34">0:12:34-0:12:39</a>:</strong>  money, leave the home zone to go to the work zone to earn the money to pay for the home<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:39">0:12:39-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  zone where you barely get to live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:47</a>:</strong>  So the practical response to your question, the simple one, is we focus on restoring community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:47">0:12:47-0:12:54</a>:</strong>  gathering places to the American grid, really the North American grid for the most part,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:54">0:12:54-0:12:59</a>:</strong>  as a way of helping people not just to see that there's been a gathering place missing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:12:59">0:12:59-0:13:05</a>:</strong>  the whole time and then restore it, but also to restore the interactive vitality that is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:05">0:13:05-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  also missing and latent at the same time in every community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:15</a>:</strong>  So we're saying, hey, everyone wake up, look, you live in the colonial grid, you're zoned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:15">0:13:15-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  so that you just are kind of this mono-cultural condition where everyone just lives in these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:26</a>:</strong>  tracks, where almost nobody speaks because there's no place for people to gather, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:26">0:13:26-0:13:33</a>:</strong>  also by omitting gathering places, you're also omitting the stewardship culture dynamism<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:33">0:13:33-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  that would be engaging in that space and stewarding it over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:43</a>:</strong>  And then you're also omitting the cultural rituals and celebrations that would be happening<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:43">0:13:43-0:13:47</a>:</strong>  otherwise cyclically and spontaneously in that space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:52</a>:</strong>  And then you're also therefore missing the automatic connection of living and working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:52">0:13:52-0:13:54</a>:</strong>  that would also happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:13:54">0:13:54-0:14:00</a>:</strong>  So we're politically disempowered by the absence of gathering places and then there's all of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:00">0:14:00-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  these other related really horrific outcomes that play out in the form of some of the worst<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  public health statistics in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:19</a>:</strong>  So our design projects, dozens of them going on at the same time, all have to do with reengaging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:19">0:14:19-0:14:25</a>:</strong>  people to not just dialogue, but to physically create gathering places in their midst once<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:25">0:14:25-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  again, some of the forms that this takes are political, like we have new ordinances that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  we've been helping to establish across the USA and Canada for people to be able to literally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:44</a>:</strong>  recreate street intersections and turn them into public squares.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:44">0:14:44-0:14:51</a>:</strong>  And that's based on the observation that in ancient free automobile urban fabric where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:51">0:14:51-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  crime statistics are super low and public health indicators are really high, the gathering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:15:01</a>:</strong>  place literally happens where people's pathways converge, you know, so-called crossroads of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:01">0:15:01-0:15:02</a>:</strong>  the village.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:02">0:15:02-0:15:07</a>:</strong>  We're basically restoring crossroads of the village to the colonial grid of the USA and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:07">0:15:07-0:15:13</a>:</strong>  Canada with remarkable public health outcomes and then impacts even on crime.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:13">0:15:13-0:15:18</a>:</strong>  So that's our main like leverage point over and over and over again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:18">0:15:18-0:15:26</a>:</strong>  And it seems the overall kind of project seems to be taking limitless varieties of forms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:26">0:15:26-0:15:29</a>:</strong>  in every project that we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:29">0:15:29-0:15:33</a>:</strong>  Now you and I were speaking just a little bit before we started recording this episode<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:33">0:15:33-0:15:37</a>:</strong>  about how we've both done a good bit of traveling and my reference to some of the things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:37">0:15:37-0:15:41</a>:</strong>  you were mentioning, like having a common town square and places of assembly kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:41">0:15:41-0:15:47</a>:</strong>  built into the infrastructure have often been in places where colonialization has really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:47">0:15:47-0:15:49</a>:</strong>  left a mark.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:49">0:15:49-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  Actually the last time that you and I spoke, I was living in Guatemala actually up until<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  recently and even in very small towns there, the central church and the government building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  usually surround a public park.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:09</a>:</strong>  And even in small towns, you'll find this configuration as a leftover of Spanish colonial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:09">0:16:09-0:16:10</a>:</strong>  culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:10">0:16:10-0:16:16</a>:</strong>  And now that I'm actually in Spain, seeing where this, you know, civic design kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:16">0:16:16-0:16:22</a>:</strong>  originated or at least before it was exported over to those areas, I definitely notice a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:22">0:16:22-0:16:26</a>:</strong>  difference in the way that people assemble and the way that towns get together and practice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:28</a>:</strong>  ceremonies and rituals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:28">0:16:28-0:16:34</a>:</strong>  You know, even though it's very different from the original colonizing culture that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:34">0:16:34-0:16:36</a>:</strong>  brought it over to that area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:36">0:16:36-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  But that being said, there are still a lot of disconnects that come even from that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  What have you noticed about the way that other types of colonial infrastructure have either<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:52</a>:</strong>  hurt or facilitated these healthier community infrastructures?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:52">0:16:52-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  Wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:16:55</a>:</strong>  Great, great, huge question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:55">0:16:55-0:16:58</a>:</strong>  I got a couple of things just to start with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:16:58">0:16:58-0:17:05</a>:</strong>  First of all, you've just touched down on a really important kind of parallel to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:05">0:17:05-0:17:07</a>:</strong>  North American grid.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:07">0:17:07-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  So north of the border that we share with Mexico, we have the national land ordinance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  in the USA and then in Canada, it's the Dominion Land Survey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:27</a>:</strong>  And in both cases, it's a proscription or, yeah, really it proscribes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:27">0:17:27-0:17:33</a>:</strong>  Both of those systems, just like south of the border where you have the law of the Indies<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:33">0:17:33-0:17:39</a>:</strong>  that the Spanish enacted to create plazas and zocalos in all of the cities and towns,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:39">0:17:39-0:17:44</a>:</strong>  even in Guatemala where you were, you have basically two different kinds of ordinances.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:44">0:17:44-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  The ones in the USA and Canada are essentially the same.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:55</a>:</strong>  They're very similar and profoundly importantly different from the law of the Indies that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:55">0:17:55-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  affected places like Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  The similarity is that they are all designed to eliminate and wipe out pre-existing cultural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:10</a>:</strong>  patterns, literally to wipe out pathways, wipe out mentalities too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:10">0:18:10-0:18:17</a>:</strong>  Like if the native population had some kind of sensibility about how they saw themselves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:23</a>:</strong>  in relation to the land that was expressed in their urban form, that had to be eliminated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  And so with the national land ordinance of the USA or the law of the Indies of Spain,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  you were basically saying, first of all, fundamentally, the land is now a commodity and we're going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  to cut it up according to this giant grid infrastructure with certain key reference<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  points for surveying, which is kind of how it begins to be laid out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:51</a>:</strong>  But fundamentally, the land is seen as a commodity and then within that space, time and even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:51">0:18:51-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  life force, including human beings, seen as labor force, is also part of what is enacted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:18:59</a>:</strong>  within the plan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:18:59">0:18:59-0:19:03</a>:</strong>  So that's the ways that they're similar to see that the world is now for sale in this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:03">0:19:03-0:19:11</a>:</strong>  colonial infrastructure that we will use as an extraction design that will enable us to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:11">0:19:11-0:19:15</a>:</strong>  take the proceeds and reap them and bring them back to the motherland.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:15">0:19:15-0:19:21</a>:</strong>  And in the case of law of the Indies, Spain intended to hold all these colonies and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:21">0:19:21-0:19:26</a>:</strong>  just reap whatever benefit they could from the people and the place and bring it back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:26">0:19:26-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  to Spain as we know they did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:34</a>:</strong>  The difference though is that Spain mandated that there be a plaza and zocalo in every<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:34">0:19:34-0:19:35</a>:</strong>  city and town.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:35">0:19:35-0:19:42</a>:</strong>  In fact, per population, there would be multiple plazas and zocalos.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:42">0:19:42-0:19:49</a>:</strong>  And you can see some of the intent or the malintent in the way that plazas and zocalos<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:49">0:19:49-0:19:57</a>:</strong>  tend to be bookended by government institutions that are able to oversee the space and can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:57">0:19:57-0:19:59</a>:</strong>  kind of control it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:19:59">0:19:59-0:20:06</a>:</strong>  You can also see it in the way that plazas and zocalos, in a beautiful way, they integrate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:06">0:20:06-0:20:13</a>:</strong>  planting, but they also really limit the scale of gathering open spaces within plazas and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:13">0:20:13-0:20:14</a>:</strong>  zocalos.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:14">0:20:14-0:20:20</a>:</strong>  In fact, dividing up the space oftentimes with statues and pavilions to make it so that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:20">0:20:20-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  the crowds can't be quite too big, except for in Mexico City where the Plaza Mayor is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  gigantic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:29">0:20:29-0:20:32</a>:</strong>  Anyway, that's the ways that they're different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:32">0:20:32-0:20:36</a>:</strong>  Let's see, maybe I should just stop there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:36">0:20:36-0:20:38</a>:</strong>  I don't think I've come quite back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:38">0:20:38-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  No, I hear what you're saying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:46</a>:</strong>  Now, given those two references as colonial cultures, which you've been working actively<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:46">0:20:46-0:20:52</a>:</strong>  to try and overcome the shortcomings and the violence inherent in those infrastructure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:52">0:20:52-0:20:57</a>:</strong>  plans, what are some of the most effective ways that you've seen or that you've been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:20:57">0:20:57-0:21:06</a>:</strong>  able to implement for people to get together on a human scale and reassemble by transforming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:06">0:21:06-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  either places of gathering or creating ones where there weren't before?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:11</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:11">0:21:11-0:21:15</a>:</strong>  Well, this is a really essential answer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:15">0:21:15-0:21:22</a>:</strong>  The most effective thing is for people, God, however they get there, to seize their own<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:22">0:21:22-0:21:25</a>:</strong>  power and start to act directly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:25">0:21:25-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  Now, we have created ordinances that have seriously liberalized the relationship of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:37</a>:</strong>  local communities to their own public space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:37">0:21:37-0:21:42</a>:</strong>  In cities across the continent, people are told they have no power in their own neighborhood,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:42">0:21:42-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  like to put in a speed bump or to put in a bench or a little free library or something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  out in the space between the sidewalk and the street.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:55</a>:</strong>  Certainly they can't do anything out in the street.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:55">0:21:55-0:21:59</a>:</strong>  In our case, we now have legal structures that have been negotiated with the city council<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:21:59">0:21:59-0:22:05</a>:</strong>  and the department of transportation that oversees something like 22,000 intersections<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:05">0:22:05-0:22:11</a>:</strong>  in our city and something like 6,000 residential right-of-way miles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:11">0:22:11-0:22:17</a>:</strong>  We now have ordinances that let people literally walk right outside and build shit without<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:17">0:22:17-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  getting a permit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  They're automatically permitted and insured simply by creating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:29</a>:</strong>  So what we have there is the system actually saying, we're going to be a real democratic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:29">0:22:29-0:22:32</a>:</strong>  mechanism and support your initiative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:32">0:22:32-0:22:38</a>:</strong>  You the resident are now so powerful, you can do anything you want and we will support<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:38">0:22:38-0:22:45</a>:</strong>  you with the might of our joint collaborative economy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:45">0:22:45-0:22:47</a>:</strong>  That's an incredible change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:47">0:22:47-0:22:53</a>:</strong>  But the answer to your question is basically to realize we were only able to accomplish<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:22:53">0:22:53-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  all of that by forcing the bureaucracy and the political leadership to come to the table.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  Because when we tried to appeal to them and say, look, we have all these statistics that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:10</a>:</strong>  in all these goals and plans, we have all these benchmarks we've tried to establish<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:10">0:23:10-0:23:19</a>:</strong>  for accomplishing sustainability and urban livability that require us to act locally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:19">0:23:19-0:23:23</a>:</strong>  in our own neighborhoods as place-based people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:23">0:23:23-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  And the city would say, well, you know, that's never been done before, so we can't do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:33</a>:</strong>  So they're not responsive usually when you appeal to them collaboratively.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:33">0:23:33-0:23:37</a>:</strong>  So the answer to your question is people have to do it anyway, whether it is legal yet or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:37">0:23:37-0:23:40</a>:</strong>  not, people just have to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:40">0:23:40-0:23:44</a>:</strong>  And believe it or not, Oliver, that's how you make it legal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:44">0:23:44-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  Every single time, we've broken many laws in this city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:23:52</a>:</strong>  And not because we enjoy breaking laws, it's like, oh, God dang it, here we are again,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:52">0:23:52-0:23:57</a>:</strong>  where they're not being responsive and they're forcing us to break the rules in order to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:57">0:23:57-0:23:58</a>:</strong>  change the rules.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:23:58">0:23:58-0:24:00</a>:</strong>  So then we'll do it again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:00">0:24:00-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  And whether we're changing an energy code or a way that we're able to use public space<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:09</a>:</strong>  or we're changing the way that, you know, park regulations work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:09">0:24:09-0:24:13</a>:</strong>  There's lots of different ways that you have to end up challenging the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:13">0:24:13-0:24:17</a>:</strong>  We've ended up being forced to do it on our own authority and having to stand there and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:17">0:24:17-0:24:22</a>:</strong>  have people get mad at us simply because they weren't able to be flexible enough or to care<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:22">0:24:22-0:24:23</a>:</strong>  enough to say yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:23">0:24:23-0:24:28</a>:</strong>  I mean, honestly, when bureaucracy is remote and disinterested, and it almost always is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:28">0:24:28-0:24:34</a>:</strong>  because it is not place-based, and the system comes up against the needs of place-based<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:34">0:24:34-0:24:37</a>:</strong>  people, you're going to always have that contradiction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:37">0:24:37-0:24:39</a>:</strong>  Here's the difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:39">0:24:39-0:24:40</a>:</strong>  Place-based people care about each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:40">0:24:40-0:24:42</a>:</strong>  They see each other in the eyes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:42">0:24:42-0:24:48</a>:</strong>  They come and go every day, even though, you know, you might come out of your house and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:48">0:24:48-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  say hi to your neighbor and not really get to know them because living and working have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:54</a>:</strong>  been disintegrated and you don't really get to work together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:54">0:24:54-0:24:56</a>:</strong>  Still, you see each other enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:24:56">0:24:56-0:25:01</a>:</strong>  Your children might play together enough that at a certain point, you talk and you care<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:01">0:25:01-0:25:06</a>:</strong>  enough about your condition that you want to slow traffic to, you know, to make the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:06">0:25:06-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  streets safer for your children to be near because they're out there on their bikes or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  something or you talk to each other and you're concerned about the state of the world and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:19</a>:</strong>  it's not good enough to just be getting it pre-digested from the papers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:19">0:25:19-0:25:24</a>:</strong>  Like you want to put in composting systems or you want to put in district energy systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:24">0:25:24-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  At a certain point, you have some professionals maybe living next to each other or a carpenter<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:31</a>:</strong>  lives next together, next to a caregiver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:31">0:25:31-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  They start to get ideas that make them feel like they could accomplish it with their skills<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:37</a>:</strong>  and talents.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:37">0:25:37-0:25:42</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, you start to like think that, hey, maybe my capability could be applied<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:42">0:25:42-0:25:43</a>:</strong>  here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:43">0:25:43-0:25:47</a>:</strong>  And of course, the bureaucracy is unresponsive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:47">0:25:47-0:25:49</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of reasons for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:49">0:25:49-0:25:54</a>:</strong>  People have all kinds of ways of understanding the bureaucracy, but they're not fundamentally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:54">0:25:54-0:25:55</a>:</strong>  place-based.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:55">0:25:55-0:25:58</a>:</strong>  They're not connected to the real issues.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:58">0:25:58-0:25:59</a>:</strong>  They're connected to their own neighborhood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:25:59">0:25:59-0:26:04</a>:</strong>  So if you remind them, you know, like one time I had to say to a bureaucrat, you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:04">0:26:04-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  what we're doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:08</a>:</strong>  We're trying to help you too because your neighborhood doesn't have a freaking public<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:08">0:26:08-0:26:09</a>:</strong>  square either.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:09">0:26:09-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  And they're like, well, okay, that's true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:17</a>:</strong>  You know, and then we actually got them to start to relate to why we needed to create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:17">0:26:17-0:26:18</a>:</strong>  a public square ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:18">0:26:18-0:26:22</a>:</strong>  And then they began to help us to legalize it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:22">0:26:22-0:26:28</a>:</strong>  So we're always navigating this disparity between the fact that communities are place-based<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:28">0:26:28-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  and bureaucracy and political systems aren't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:36</a>:</strong>  They all come from kind of everywhere else to come together to do job descriptions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:36">0:26:36-0:26:40</a>:</strong>  And they don't really get to jail as a, in a sense of community themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:40">0:26:40-0:26:44</a>:</strong>  So every time a place-based community sort of stands up and has to challenge the regulations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:44">0:26:44-0:26:51</a>:</strong>  and force the rules to change, it even benefits the bureaucrats and politicians that are opposing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:51">0:26:51-0:26:52</a>:</strong>  them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:26:52">0:26:52-0:27:00</a>:</strong>  I'm actually getting rather tired of always having to navigate this ridiculous set of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:00">0:27:00-0:27:01</a>:</strong>  contradictions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:01">0:27:01-0:27:04</a>:</strong>  But now we know how to do it and we're successful every time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:04">0:27:04-0:27:08</a>:</strong>  But it always has to start, this is the answer to your question, over in Oregon, people have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:08">0:27:08-0:27:14</a>:</strong>  to reclaim their power, face the paradoxes that they already are inhabiting and just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:14">0:27:14-0:27:17</a>:</strong>  say to themselves, no one else can freaking have my power.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:17">0:27:17-0:27:21</a>:</strong>  I refuse to ask permission anymore for things that are simply common sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:21">0:27:21-0:27:27</a>:</strong>  You know, speaking of Guatemala, one of my favorite examples of this is in Guatemala<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:33</a>:</strong>  where you might have some teenager driving through the neighborhood too quickly, very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:33">0:27:33-0:27:34</a>:</strong>  frequently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:34">0:27:34-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  And then somebody says, all right, let's get out the two by four with nails in it again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:42</a>:</strong>  And they drag it across the street in order to force cars to slow down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:42">0:27:42-0:27:46</a>:</strong>  And you can only get the two by four pulled out from in front of your car if you donate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:46">0:27:46-0:27:49</a>:</strong>  some money into a can for the local school fund.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:49">0:27:49-0:27:56</a>:</strong>  Like neighborhoods in Guatemala literally affects serious traffic calming by themselves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:27:56">0:27:56-0:28:00</a>:</strong>  under their own authority without having to ask permission.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:00">0:28:00-0:28:04</a>:</strong>  And a two by four with some nails in it is enough to slow down all the cars.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:04">0:28:04-0:28:11</a>:</strong>  And you wouldn't dream of doing that in the U.S. today because we're so cowed by the authorities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:11">0:28:11-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  But in Guatemala, not that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:16</a>:</strong>  It was amazing to witness that kind of self authorization.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:16">0:28:16-0:28:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I have to say I witnessed a lot of those types of self-government acts in the various<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:22">0:28:22-0:28:25</a>:</strong>  communities that I had a chance to interact with while I lived there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:25">0:28:25-0:28:30</a>:</strong>  And a lot of it comes from the fact that, you know, larger governmental bodies are quite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:30">0:28:30-0:28:34</a>:</strong>  ineffectual the further you get away from the capital city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:34">0:28:34-0:28:40</a>:</strong>  And given that we were about five hours drive most of the time that I was living in Guatemala,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:40">0:28:40-0:28:44</a>:</strong>  you start to feel the effects of government much, much less, especially as you get into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:44">0:28:44-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  the rural areas and seeing how local Alcalde's and other kind of community leaders found<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:28:53">0:28:53-0:29:02</a>:</strong>  ways, creative ways to, yeah, exactly sort of enforce laws, but also create a sense that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:02">0:29:02-0:29:08</a>:</strong>  you know, we're in this together and punishment isn't so much as getting rid of the problem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:08">0:29:08-0:29:11</a>:</strong>  as finding a way of sort of with it in house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:11">0:29:11-0:29:16</a>:</strong>  And I've been fortunate enough to see pretty inspiring examples of that all over the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:16">0:29:16-0:29:21</a>:</strong>  But to go back to something that you were kind of touching on and somewhat dancing around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:21">0:29:21-0:29:24</a>:</strong>  is this idea of becoming people of place again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:24">0:29:24-0:29:30</a>:</strong>  And I've heard it sort of explained in a number of different ways, perhaps reindigenizing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:30">0:29:30-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  oneself as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:39</a>:</strong>  Give me an idea of how one can start to cultivate a mindset of getting back into their own power<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:39">0:29:39-0:29:45</a>:</strong>  and understanding what it is that we should consider our rights as citizens and as members<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:45">0:29:45-0:29:50</a>:</strong>  of communities so that we can actually think outside of the infrastructure that we were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:50">0:29:50-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  born into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:29:56</a>:</strong>  And many of us, much like a fish does not realize that it's swimming in water, we don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:29:56">0:29:56-0:30:02</a>:</strong>  realize that there are many other ways to live given just how prolific this type of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:02">0:30:02-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  infrastructure is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  Boy, that's such a great question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:07</a>:</strong>  Thanks for asking that question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:07">0:30:07-0:30:10</a>:</strong>  Let me ask you to talk about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:10">0:30:10-0:30:17</a>:</strong>  Well, I have a lot of lived experience that can help with this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:17">0:30:17-0:30:23</a>:</strong>  I guess the first thing I want to say is that for a lot of us, we feel like we have to kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:23">0:30:23-0:30:29</a>:</strong>  of understand everything before we can act or before we can know what to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:29">0:30:29-0:30:34</a>:</strong>  And I just want to advise people listening to this that I think the best that you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:34">0:30:34-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  do is come to a point of action because you'll never figure it all out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:30:50</a>:</strong>  You have to kind of, and I totally understand that kind of desperate desire to have a framework.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:50">0:30:50-0:30:57</a>:</strong>  I think what helps me to just really, God, I got to this place where I absolutely committed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:30:57">0:30:57-0:31:00</a>:</strong>  to the ground that I was standing on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:00">0:31:00-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  And I almost had to laugh because if you were to ask me in the abstract, Mark, where would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:07</a>:</strong>  you like to live the rest of your life?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:07">0:31:07-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  Where would you stand your ground for your village culture?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:11">0:31:11-0:31:16</a>:</strong>  I would have either said, the ground, the land of my Celtic ancestors, I shall return<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:16">0:31:16-0:31:22</a>:</strong>  to that place in Lakeland of England.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:22">0:31:22-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  I might've said that, or I might've said, I'm going to go to an island in Thailand because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:30</a>:</strong>  it's the most beautiful place I can imagine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:30">0:31:30-0:31:37</a>:</strong>  But where it was, was actually one of the most mundane choices I possibly could have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:37">0:31:37-0:31:39</a>:</strong>  made in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:39">0:31:39-0:31:44</a>:</strong>  A typical colonial grid neighborhood where I myself had grown up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:44">0:31:44-0:31:49</a>:</strong>  That was where I was the moment that I realized that the ultimate revolution and the finding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:49">0:31:49-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  of my power would be to stand my ground permanently in a place and just hammer on that location<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:05</a>:</strong>  with all my power and create a continuity of relationship over time to the people and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:05">0:32:05-0:32:11</a>:</strong>  to the environment and just keep affecting change and affecting change from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:11">0:32:11-0:32:16</a>:</strong>  But it was in the last place I would have thought I would have made that commitment,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:16">0:32:16-0:32:21</a>:</strong>  the very place where I grew up, that I was wanting to escape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:21">0:32:21-0:32:25</a>:</strong>  And it has really worked out perfectly in a lot of ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:25">0:32:25-0:32:33</a>:</strong>  Its very mundanity makes it, and repetition and its sameness is a perfect context for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:33">0:32:33-0:32:38</a>:</strong>  generating prototypes that can help people in all of these other conditions that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:38">0:32:38-0:32:44</a>:</strong>  really very much the same, to inspire them to make change themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:44">0:32:44-0:32:50</a>:</strong>  So I guess what I'm saying is for anybody listening here, I would recommend that to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:50">0:32:50-0:32:56</a>:</strong>  just get to the point where you decide to commit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:32:56">0:32:56-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  And you won't know all the same things I know, you'll just know what you know, you'll know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:02</a>:</strong>  what you know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:02">0:33:02-0:33:06</a>:</strong>  But you can know this, like you can ask yourself this question and come up with your own answer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:06">0:33:06-0:33:12</a>:</strong>  like when in the freaking world am I finally going to be home?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:12">0:33:12-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  Am I always going to keep dreaming of a better place?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:20</a>:</strong>  Like you know once I have enough money I'll sell this place or I'll stop renting this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:20">0:33:20-0:33:26</a>:</strong>  place and I'll go live in a co-housing community or ecovillage outside of town or I'll move<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:26">0:33:26-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  to another country to escape this crass capitalism or whatever your dream might be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:33:38</a>:</strong>  For myself it was just this moment where I was like aha I see committing to place, calling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:38">0:33:38-0:33:40</a>:</strong>  myself a villager.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:40">0:33:40-0:33:48</a>:</strong>  Like what I did was I just was like I shot my cat down into the planet in that moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:48">0:33:48-0:33:54</a>:</strong>  I was like oh my god I just need to commit to somewhere and set in my roots and hold<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:54">0:33:54-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:33:55">0:33:55-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  At that time I would have these dreams like of a storm, that I was a tree and I kept trying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:08</a>:</strong>  to hold soil and the storm was blowing the soil away from my roots.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:08">0:34:08-0:34:17</a>:</strong>  And I kept trying to grab particles of ground to aggregate it back and the storm was relentless<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:17">0:34:17-0:34:22</a>:</strong>  and it was hopeless and then another plant would somehow come along and its roots would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:22">0:34:22-0:34:25</a>:</strong>  join with mine and we would start to be able to hold some soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:25">0:34:25-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  And it was literally a metaphor for what was going on in my neighborhood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:34</a>:</strong>  Like just as soon as we were building community and all these people within four square blocks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:34">0:34:34-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  knew each other with our first intersection guerrilla project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:43</a>:</strong>  As soon as we knew each other then we saw that people were moving and then we were like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:43">0:34:43-0:34:48</a>:</strong>  oh my god this is happening all the time and we don't even know it because we don't even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:48">0:34:48-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  know each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:34:54</a>:</strong>  That everyone's always moving like Americans move every four to seven years and we could<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:54">0:34:54-0:34:56</a>:</strong>  see it happening right in our own experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:34:56">0:34:56-0:35:00</a>:</strong>  That was empowering, it was demoralizing but it was also empowering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:00">0:35:00-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  Like we've got to stop moving.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:02">0:35:02-0:35:10</a>:</strong>  We've got to hold our ground together and so the consequences of holding our ground<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:10">0:35:10-0:35:16</a>:</strong>  have been things like new civic ordinances like I was saying that make it so that everyone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:16">0:35:16-0:35:23</a>:</strong>  across the city can revolutionize their own relationship to the right-of-way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:23">0:35:23-0:35:26</a>:</strong>  Opening up pathways within the blocks to connect everyone internally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:26">0:35:26-0:35:32</a>:</strong>  So you've been really decompartmentalizing the grid of isolation and turning it into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:32">0:35:32-0:35:34</a>:</strong>  a landscape of connection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:34">0:35:34-0:35:37</a>:</strong>  Lots and lots of food is being grown all over the place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:37">0:35:37-0:35:39</a>:</strong>  Places for children to play.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:39">0:35:39-0:35:43</a>:</strong>  We've stabilized the community so almost no one moves anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:43">0:35:43-0:35:48</a>:</strong>  People have studied us and published reports in health journals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:48">0:35:48-0:35:55</a>:</strong>  Basically crime has plummeted and people are mentally and physically healthier but the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:55">0:35:55-0:35:59</a>:</strong>  main thing is the project then has replicated across the continent in like more than a hundred<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:35:59">0:35:59-0:36:03</a>:</strong>  cities and we don't even know anymore how many cities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:03">0:36:03-0:36:07</a>:</strong>  So by standing our ground and I'm like I'm standing my ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:07">0:36:07-0:36:09</a>:</strong>  I'm inviting other people to stand their ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:09">0:36:09-0:36:14</a>:</strong>  By standing your ground and claiming your place you also claim your power.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:14">0:36:14-0:36:19</a>:</strong>  If you say that you have a relationship to place and you start to act from a place of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:19">0:36:19-0:36:25</a>:</strong>  connection, it leads you to do things that are positively revolutionary and sometimes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:25">0:36:25-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  outside of or within the rules and there is no more powerful place to be coming from if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:37</a>:</strong>  you want to change your city and offer prototypes and stories to inspire other people than that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:37">0:36:37-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  Mark, I think it's remarkable that it seems that as I get better at doing these interviews<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:50</a>:</strong>  I end up talking with people at just the right time to give me some confidence in difficult<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:36:56</a>:</strong>  decisions that I've made and if anybody who's listening now has sort of followed the genesis<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:36:56">0:36:56-0:37:01</a>:</strong>  of this podcast they've heard me go through everything from like kind of being a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:01">0:37:01-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  bit uprooted and being an apprentice at a friend of mine's in Guatemala to like co-investing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:08">0:37:08-0:37:14</a>:</strong>  on a farm and really feeling like I finally had found my home and then also the displacement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:14">0:37:14-0:37:19</a>:</strong>  that I felt as that arrangement became I mean it wasn't we weren't all going in the same<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:19">0:37:19-0:37:25</a>:</strong>  direction and I decided to move again but I represent exactly that generation that you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:25">0:37:25-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:26">0:37:26-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  I've moved, man I can't even count how many times I've basically been traveling independently<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:38</a>:</strong>  for almost 14 years now and we're literally having this conversation about four days into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:38">0:37:38-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  me settling into the spot that I've decided is going to be my home and where I'm going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  to stand my ground and so many of the things that you've just said resonate with this journey<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:57</a>:</strong>  that I've gone on and realizing that there's no place that you can decide on going that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:37:57">0:37:57-0:38:02</a>:</strong>  going to be perfect certainly not in how damaged and disconnected our world has become at this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:02">0:38:02-0:38:07</a>:</strong>  point and if you're looking for the perfect place you won't find it you will constantly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:07">0:38:07-0:38:15</a>:</strong>  keep moving but if you decide that you're going to be sort of the change or the conduit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:15">0:38:15-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  for the good things that you find missing in the place that you decide to go home or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:25</a>:</strong>  that you decide to stand your ground on then you actually have a chance at creating where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:25">0:38:25-0:38:31</a>:</strong>  and how you want to live and sort of with that said I would love to hear about some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:31">0:38:31-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  of the projects that you and your team have worked on that have started to create that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:41</a>:</strong>  meaningful change within the neighborhoods that you've been able to interact with and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:41">0:38:41-0:38:42</a>:</strong>  work in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:42">0:38:42-0:38:44</a>:</strong>  Can you say that last sentence again?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:44">0:38:44-0:38:49</a>:</strong>  That was a beautiful beautiful response there to all that I had said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:49">0:38:49-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  Say that last sentence again, question?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah well let's explore some of the projects that you and your team have worked on within<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:38:57">0:38:57-0:39:00</a>:</strong>  the communities that you've had the chance to interact with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:00">0:39:00-0:39:06</a>:</strong>  I know you've done designs for co-housing developments within I think it was in Portland.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:06">0:39:06-0:39:11</a>:</strong>  You've worked with city repair at sort of rejuvenating those intersections like you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:11">0:39:11-0:39:13</a>:</strong>  had mentioned earlier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:13">0:39:13-0:39:18</a>:</strong>  What are some of the projects that you feel have taught you the most about sort of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:18">0:39:18-0:39:22</a>:</strong>  steps that can start to reconnect these disconnected infrastructures?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:22">0:39:22-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  Okay I'll kind of talk about small things and giant larger things and giant things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  By all means.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:41</a>:</strong>  Let's see well smaller things smaller things that kind of are doable at a community scale<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:41">0:39:41-0:39:50</a>:</strong>  can happen at you know places like in your neighborhoods or schools or people's businesses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:39:58</a>:</strong>  I'm thinking right now of this installation that I've been helping people to do some maintenance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:39:58">0:39:58-0:40:00</a>:</strong>  on recently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:00">0:40:00-0:40:03</a>:</strong>  It seems like such a small thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:03">0:40:03-0:40:06</a>:</strong>  It's in someone's front yard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:06">0:40:06-0:40:08</a>:</strong>  It's an earth and masonry project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:08">0:40:08-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  It's very very sculptural and it's inspired by this epiphany that a man had.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:17</a>:</strong>  He was reading an article.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:17">0:40:17-0:40:24</a>:</strong>  His name was Fatah and he was reading an article about how the majority of what we see in our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:24">0:40:24-0:40:34</a>:</strong>  society is kind of historically it's been created by enacted or decided upon or created<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:34">0:40:34-0:40:45</a>:</strong>  or literally physically built by white men between 35 and 75 or something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:45">0:40:45-0:40:51</a>:</strong>  And after this this after Fatah got done reading this article he was really upset.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:51">0:40:51-0:40:58</a>:</strong>  He was like my God the spectrum of possibility is really in my own experience has been limited<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:40:58">0:40:58-0:41:06</a>:</strong>  by men who are traditionally emotionally stunted and their capacity to express and to emote<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:06">0:41:06-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  is limited.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:11</a>:</strong>  We're actually living within the mental framework of what they think is possible or appropriate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:11">0:41:11-0:41:14</a>:</strong>  in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:14">0:41:14-0:41:20</a>:</strong>  And part of the article that he read was suggesting that perhaps a more sustainable reality would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:20">0:41:20-0:41:28</a>:</strong>  be more inclusive and expressive of a broader spectrum of human possibility.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  So it happened that Fatah was connected to this family, a mother and a couple of little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  girls across the street.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:42</a>:</strong>  He just marched across the street and he asked the little girl who was about six what she<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:42">0:41:42-0:41:45</a>:</strong>  thought needed to happen in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:45">0:41:45-0:41:49</a>:</strong>  He said with all the changes that are happening in our city what do you think needs to happen?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:49">0:41:49-0:41:52</a>:</strong>  What would you what would make the world a better place?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:52">0:41:52-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  So that's this installation that he ended up building in his front yard is the vision<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:00</a>:</strong>  of the little girl who was his friend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:00">0:42:00-0:42:02</a>:</strong>  He facilitated the creation of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:02">0:42:02-0:42:07</a>:</strong>  He brought this fantastic builder from Canada, Pat Heneberry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:07">0:42:07-0:42:09</a>:</strong>  It's kind of a legend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:09">0:42:09-0:42:12</a>:</strong>  That's one of my heroes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:12">0:42:12-0:42:14</a>:</strong>  I use one of my first guests on this podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:14">0:42:14-0:42:16</a>:</strong>  Oh my gosh, beautiful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:16">0:42:16-0:42:17</a>:</strong>  Thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:17">0:42:17-0:42:23</a>:</strong>  I don't know if you know, but Pat, you know, he's got Parkinson's disease now and it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:23">0:42:23-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  very severe at this point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:31</a>:</strong>  I just saw him about a month ago and he's certainly not long for this world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:31">0:42:31-0:42:36</a>:</strong>  So the restoration of that project right now is front burner for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:36">0:42:36-0:42:39</a>:</strong>  It's a murder situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:39">0:42:39-0:42:44</a>:</strong>  Anyway, what was created looks like this giant wave inspired by this little girl's vision.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:44">0:42:44-0:42:49</a>:</strong>  I mean, part of the conversation that Fada had with her was that she always wished that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:49">0:42:49-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  she had a big sister who was a mermaid.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  So if you go to see this little gathering place, it's in the form of a wave with a lighthouse<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:01</a>:</strong>  and a mermaid and it's all made out of cob.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:01">0:43:01-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  It's very gaudiest and it looks, I mean, it does all the things that we want it to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:16</a>:</strong>  You know, it quests the private edge of public space and it says, instead of fortifying that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:16">0:43:16-0:43:21</a>:</strong>  edge or trying to delineate what's mine and what's yours or what's not yours and what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:21">0:43:21-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  mine, as most edges tend to do, it says, come across the edge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  Come into the embrace of this fabulous fantasy of a better world, of a more sculptural and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:35</a>:</strong>  inspiring story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:35">0:43:35-0:43:39</a>:</strong>  And of course it's modeling sustainability because it's made by human hands.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:39">0:43:39-0:43:40</a>:</strong>  You just, it's inescapable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:40">0:43:40-0:43:44</a>:</strong>  It's the most beautiful, lovingly crafted place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:44">0:43:44-0:43:51</a>:</strong>  It's in this completely fantastical form with this luminous roof floating overhead made<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:51">0:43:51-0:43:55</a>:</strong>  out of parts and pieces from the ocean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:43:55">0:43:55-0:44:00</a>:</strong>  So that's small, but it's actually gigantic because it provides an example for everyone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:00">0:44:00-0:44:05</a>:</strong>  living with that same mundane edge of private versus public.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:05">0:44:05-0:44:10</a>:</strong>  And it invites people to reconsider whether or not they'd like to invite people across<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:10">0:44:10-0:44:13</a>:</strong>  the line or whether they'd like to fortify that line.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:13">0:44:13-0:44:19</a>:</strong>  I'm happy to tell you that project has contributed to, you know, something like 700 similar projects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:19">0:44:19-0:44:21</a>:</strong>  across this city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:21">0:44:21-0:44:25</a>:</strong>  So it's just, you know, it seems small, but it's actually gigantic because it becomes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:25">0:44:25-0:44:32</a>:</strong>  a way of inspiring change everywhere where people live individually or with family.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:32">0:44:32-0:44:37</a>:</strong>  And they contribute to that, you know, to either reinforcing the idea that we're all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:37">0:44:37-0:44:41</a>:</strong>  separate or that we're all connected and everyone can make a statement along their own personal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:41">0:44:41-0:44:42</a>:</strong>  edge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:42">0:44:42-0:44:44</a>:</strong>  And frankly, I think that's how the world is going to change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:44">0:44:44-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  It's two small acts that aggregate into a larger change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:44:53</a>:</strong>  But it isn't just that project inspiring things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:53">0:44:53-0:44:57</a>:</strong>  It's, I mean, it's inspired politicians to make policy changes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:44:57">0:44:57-0:45:03</a>:</strong>  It's inspired bureaucrats to become sympathetic and redirect transportation routes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:03">0:45:03-0:45:08</a>:</strong>  Like the bike, the bike route system comes close to that project in order to, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:08">0:45:08-0:45:10</a>:</strong>  let people come visit that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:10">0:45:10-0:45:13</a>:</strong>  So that's a small project, but it's gigantic in its impact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:13">0:45:13-0:45:17</a>:</strong>  And it's actually a huge project because it was never about the thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:17">0:45:17-0:45:20</a>:</strong>  It was always about the consciousness of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:20">0:45:20-0:45:23</a>:</strong>  So I'm talking about something small, but it's really quite gigantic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:23">0:45:23-0:45:24</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:24">0:45:24-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  Then there's actually overtly gigantic things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:34</a>:</strong>  Like lately we've been working on climate resilience projects and worked on a team to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:34">0:45:34-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  redesign the entire watershed of Islais Creek, which is the majority of San Francisco, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:38">0:45:38-0:45:43</a>:</strong>  turn the urban sewer system into a water catchment system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:43">0:45:43-0:45:49</a>:</strong>  So instead of trying to get rid of rain runoff and domestic and, you know, commercial and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:49">0:45:49-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  institutional effluent to instead install upstream intervention systems, black water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:46:04</a>:</strong>  and gray water systems everywhere, and then basically recreate all domestic and institutional<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:04">0:46:04-0:46:09</a>:</strong>  commercial landscapes and public right-of-ways so that we're catching and absorbing water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:09">0:46:09-0:46:15</a>:</strong>  and storing water by millions and millions of gallons in order to address the climate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:15">0:46:15-0:46:22</a>:</strong>  emergency, the extended drought in California, to capture all of this biomass and use it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:22">0:46:22-0:46:26</a>:</strong>  instead to regenerate landscapes and sequester carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:26">0:46:26-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  And so giant systemic change projects, in that case funded by the Rockefeller Foundation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:38</a>:</strong>  they've been inspired after the Sandy Hurricane to realize the climate change is desperately<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:38">0:46:38-0:46:46</a>:</strong>  real and we've gotten to engage as permaculturists with them being specifically interested in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:46">0:46:46-0:46:50</a>:</strong>  what a permaculture team could contribute.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:50">0:46:50-0:46:53</a>:</strong>  So I don't know, that's huge on design scales.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:53">0:46:53-0:46:56</a>:</strong>  That's supposed to be driven.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:46:56">0:46:56-0:47:02</a>:</strong>  I'm so glad to hear that those types of organizations are taking a real look and putting money down<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:02">0:47:02-0:47:07</a>:</strong>  on infrastructure projects that actually work towards regeneration and resilience rather<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:07">0:47:07-0:47:16</a>:</strong>  than sort of putting the project or the issue onto somebody else's plate or just getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:16">0:47:16-0:47:21</a>:</strong>  rid of it, starting to look at these as resources rather than destructive forces if managed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:22</a>:</strong>  properly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:22">0:47:22-0:47:24</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it was very heartening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:24">0:47:24-0:47:32</a>:</strong>  At the same time, it was beginning to see that there was this bright light shining from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:32">0:47:32-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  within the context of Rockefeller in connection to city administrations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:47:46</a>:</strong>  It was also very sobering because as we traveled around the Bay Area, we basically traveled<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:46">0:47:46-0:47:54</a>:</strong>  for, I think, six weeks around the Bay Area meeting administrators and visiting different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:47:54">0:47:54-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  communities and Rockefeller was having us do workshops with all these climate scientists<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:04</a>:</strong>  and different specialists.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:04">0:48:04-0:48:11</a>:</strong>  We kept learning things from specialists that just somehow wasn't being absorbed and integrated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:11">0:48:11-0:48:15</a>:</strong>  by political leadership or bureaucracies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:15">0:48:15-0:48:20</a>:</strong>  So for instance, we would go from a workshop in the morning with Klaus Jacobs, who's like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:20">0:48:20-0:48:26</a>:</strong>  the Einstein of climate scientists, and he's saying to us in the morning, this whole thing,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:26">0:48:26-0:48:34</a>:</strong>  this whole sea level rise danger can go as high as 200 feet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:34">0:48:34-0:48:40</a>:</strong>  And then in the afternoon, we're visiting Silicon Valley and listening to their elected<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:40">0:48:40-0:48:42</a>:</strong>  leadership saying, we're going to hold the line here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:42">0:48:42-0:48:44</a>:</strong>  We're going to build a three foot levee.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:44">0:48:44-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  We're going to stop climate change right here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:55</a>:</strong>  And I remember all of these architects and planners on all these teams.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:48:55">0:48:55-0:49:02</a>:</strong>  And they're, for the most part, really uncomfortable asking questions like reconciling the difference<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:02">0:49:02-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  between what they heard in the morning and what they're seeing in the afternoon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:05">0:49:05-0:49:10</a>:</strong>  So I'm always having to stand out like a sore thumb permaculturist asking uncomfortable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:10">0:49:10-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  So I said to the administrator, well, you know, we just heard from our advisors that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  the problem is going to go at least 200 feet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:23</a>:</strong>  And no, no, it could go as high as 200 feet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:23">0:49:23-0:49:30</a>:</strong>  And supposedly, if it goes 10 feet, it will destabilize so much about the economy and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:30">0:49:30-0:49:39</a>:</strong>  political and political culture, that the next 190 feet will just happen without any<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:39">0:49:39-0:49:41</a>:</strong>  ability to stop it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:41">0:49:41-0:49:44</a>:</strong>  So I was like, you know, you guys must be hearing some of this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:44">0:49:44-0:49:49</a>:</strong>  I mean, if you don't talk about it in the open, at least when you're having beers together<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:49">0:49:49-0:49:53</a>:</strong>  after work as friends, do you talk about this stuff?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:53">0:49:53-0:49:56</a>:</strong>  This administrator is just looking at me like I'm a space alien.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:49:56">0:49:56-0:50:00</a>:</strong>  And he's like, you know, no, we don't talk about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:00">0:50:00-0:50:07</a>:</strong>  So everywhere we went, one of the things that we were learning is that on one hand, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:07">0:50:07-0:50:12</a>:</strong>  Rockefeller Foundation representatives are saying to us, you know, the Bay Area is our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:12">0:50:12-0:50:19</a>:</strong>  greatest hope, because it has the most ability to have political consensus.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:19">0:50:19-0:50:25</a>:</strong>  And it has the most diversity of people and geographic, kind of urban circumstances and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:25">0:50:25-0:50:26</a>:</strong>  landform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:26">0:50:26-0:50:29</a>:</strong>  So we can provide prototypes for people all over the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:29">0:50:29-0:50:33</a>:</strong>  And on the other hand, then we're out in the afternoon learning that, yeah, there's some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:33">0:50:33-0:50:42</a>:</strong>  amount of political, you know, kind of inclination in the Bay, but wholly unprepared in terms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:42">0:50:42-0:50:49</a>:</strong>  of facts, and any kind of grasp on the scope of the problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:49">0:50:49-0:50:53</a>:</strong>  So it was an illuminating process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:53">0:50:53-0:50:54</a>:</strong>  I'm really glad for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:54">0:50:54-0:50:58</a>:</strong>  I'm totally tooled up to work on projects of this kind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:50:58">0:50:58-0:51:02</a>:</strong>  But at the same time, it was sobering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:02">0:51:02-0:51:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it would seem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:05">0:51:05-0:51:10</a>:</strong>  Now, one of the things that I know that you've explored with your teams and such is the problem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:10">0:51:10-0:51:16</a>:</strong>  of displaced people within this country, and many of them refer to them as homeless people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:16">0:51:16-0:51:21</a>:</strong>  You've worked with homeless communities and development of bringing dignity back to these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:21">0:51:21-0:51:28</a>:</strong>  settlements, as this becomes an increasingly big problem, especially in our urban areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:28">0:51:28-0:51:33</a>:</strong>  Can you give me some insights on what you've learned in the process of trying to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:33">0:51:33-0:51:39</a>:</strong>  how this problem continues to evolve in our country?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:39">0:51:39-0:51:44</a>:</strong>  And what are some of the solutions or at least hopes that you found in infrastructure that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:44">0:51:44-0:51:46</a>:</strong>  can include all people?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:46">0:51:46-0:51:56</a>:</strong>  Well, speaking of all people, I was in Denver, I was in Boulder a couple years ago, and working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:51:56">0:51:56-0:52:02</a>:</strong>  with homeless people there and doing some design charrettes for house-less villages,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:02">0:52:02-0:52:03</a>:</strong>  tiny home villages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:03">0:52:03-0:52:09</a>:</strong>  This is a project I've been working on since 1999, so 20 years into this, really working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:09">0:52:09-0:52:12</a>:</strong>  hard on replicating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:12">0:52:12-0:52:14</a>:</strong>  You used the word dignity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:14">0:52:14-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  Our first village was named Dignity Village, and it's still going strong and has been providing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  assistance to communities all over the country to be able to create similar prototypes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:28</a>:</strong>  So it's very exciting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:28">0:52:28-0:52:38</a>:</strong>  But when I was in Denver, I heard from a homeless person speaking at an event that Howard Einstein's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:38">0:52:38-0:52:42</a>:</strong>  granddaughter is a homeless person living in Denver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:42">0:52:42-0:52:50</a>:</strong>  And you hear something like that, and it's like, okay, how much more convincing do people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:50">0:52:50-0:52:58</a>:</strong>  need to understand that this is really an economic issue?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:58">0:52:58-0:52:59</a>:</strong>  It's very complex.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:52:59">0:52:59-0:53:00</a>:</strong>  It's very complex.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:00">0:53:00-0:53:07</a>:</strong>  But I think it's too easy for people to continue to do this same stuff about marginalizing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:07">0:53:07-0:53:12</a>:</strong>  people based on their projections, that people are too lazy or they just don't want to work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:12">0:53:12-0:53:15</a>:</strong>  or they have a mental health problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:15">0:53:15-0:53:20</a>:</strong>  In the case of Einstein's granddaughter, probably she's wandering around sitting there having<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:20">0:53:20-0:53:26</a>:</strong>  epiphanies about the relationship of light and space, and she can't be bothered to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:26">0:53:26-0:53:30</a>:</strong>  a job at 7-Eleven because she's too busy counting stars or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:30">0:53:30-0:53:37</a>:</strong>  Seriously, in my work over these last 20 years, I have met so many brilliant people who probably<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:37">0:53:37-0:53:41</a>:</strong>  would not be living in the streets if they lived in a society that would embrace them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:41">0:53:41-0:53:44</a>:</strong>  for their qualities and their talents.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:44">0:53:44-0:53:52</a>:</strong>  I've also met people who won't suffer the indignity of trading their time for money<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:52">0:53:52-0:53:53</a>:</strong>  because life is too interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:53">0:53:53-0:53:59</a>:</strong>  So I've met people who are intensely artistic and they live outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:53:59">0:53:59-0:54:02</a>:</strong>  I'm just going to give you a bunch of different thoughts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:02">0:54:02-0:54:08</a>:</strong>  I mean, Oregon Public Broadcasting, National Public Radio ran a series a couple of years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:08">0:54:08-0:54:15</a>:</strong>  ago on the surprising percentage of people who have nomadic ancestry that live out in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:15">0:54:15-0:54:17</a>:</strong>  the streets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:17">0:54:17-0:54:25</a>:</strong>  When I heard this series, I was thinking about that story in the Bible, which is basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:25">0:54:25-0:54:32</a>:</strong>  just this allegory about the conflict between the rise of the city-state and colonialism<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:32">0:54:32-0:54:36</a>:</strong>  and its hostility toward all things local, all local cultures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:36">0:54:36-0:54:43</a>:</strong>  So Cain, whose name basically means city-state, kills his brother, Abel, whose name basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:43">0:54:43-0:54:45</a>:</strong>  means nomad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:45">0:54:45-0:54:53</a>:</strong>  What we have is this hostility toward the ephemeral, toward alternative forms of culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:53">0:54:53-0:54:58</a>:</strong>  And colonialism basically needs everyone to be nailed down to ground to pay for their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:54:58">0:54:58-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  space to fund the society.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:05</a>:</strong>  And we basically outlawed an entire paradigm on a way of being.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:05">0:55:05-0:55:10</a>:</strong>  A lot of people out in the streets apparently have a proclivity for being nomadic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:10">0:55:10-0:55:14</a>:</strong>  And we're telling them that they have nowhere, there's no ground for them to sleep in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:14">0:55:14-0:55:20</a>:</strong>  world, simply because we've decided to outlaw the very phenomena of being nomadic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:20">0:55:20-0:55:25</a>:</strong>  This is so profoundly unjust, so profoundly ignorant and criminal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:25">0:55:25-0:55:31</a>:</strong>  And it's just one aspect of homelessness, just one dimension of the conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:31">0:55:31-0:55:33</a>:</strong>  Isn't that a thought in my mind?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:33">0:55:33-0:55:35</a>:</strong>  It's as complex as each individual.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:35">0:55:35-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  Truly, truly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:43</a>:</strong>  Who knows why Einstein's grand-mother and grand-daughter would be homeless?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:43">0:55:43-0:55:49</a>:</strong>  Who knows what's happening in her life to make this happen?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:49">0:55:49-0:55:52</a>:</strong>  And you know, as I've been working on this and meeting people personally, it goes from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:52">0:55:52-0:55:57</a>:</strong>  being a conceptual project where I'm doing it for different reasons, like, gosh, all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:55:57">0:55:57-0:56:02</a>:</strong>  of these houses villages are prototyped for carbon reduction, how exciting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:02">0:56:02-0:56:10</a>:</strong>  For me as a design nerd, one of the biggest motivations is I get to just relish this experience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:10">0:56:10-0:56:17</a>:</strong>  of regenerating urban form over and over again, and witnessing the playing out of settlement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:17">0:56:17-0:56:19</a>:</strong>  patterns, which is one of the most...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:19">0:56:19-0:56:23</a>:</strong>  People think that, you know, when they think about design, they think about forms and objects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:23">0:56:23-0:56:25</a>:</strong>  and products and architecture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:25">0:56:25-0:56:33</a>:</strong>  The ultimate design is to witness people collaborating together to create urban form, to create settlement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:33">0:56:33-0:56:39</a>:</strong>  patterns that, like, evidence how they move in space and how they relate to each other,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:39">0:56:39-0:56:45</a>:</strong>  how they respond to climate and light, to wind and rain, and then alchemize the material<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:45">0:56:45-0:56:49</a>:</strong>  around them into a habitat where they find shelter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:49">0:56:49-0:56:52</a>:</strong>  That's the ultimate gig for human design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:52">0:56:52-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  And, you know, that's what we mean by permaculture, of course, but we rarely think of it in terms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:57:04</a>:</strong>  of urban form because permaculturists mostly focus, you know, on domestic systems and planting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:04">0:57:04-0:57:07</a>:</strong>  guilds and things like that, but it applies to all scales.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:07">0:57:07-0:57:12</a>:</strong>  I don't know, thinking about homelessness, I'm learning constantly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:12">0:57:12-0:57:18</a>:</strong>  Like the other day, there was an article released on the internet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:18">0:57:18-0:57:25</a>:</strong>  There was a study done, I think in Portland, on that for every $100 average increase in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:25">0:57:25-0:57:31</a>:</strong>  rent across the city, homelessness increases by 15%.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:31">0:57:31-0:57:32</a>:</strong>  That is not...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:32">0:57:32-0:57:33</a>:</strong>  Oh, God.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:33">0:57:33-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  Do you...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:35</a>:</strong>  No, it isn't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:35">0:57:35-0:57:36</a>:</strong>  Like, that tells us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:36">0:57:36-0:57:39</a>:</strong>  And here's another thing related to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:39">0:57:39-0:57:46</a>:</strong>  When I was in Oakland a couple of years ago doing a workshop on colonialism and gentrification,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:46">0:57:46-0:57:53</a>:</strong>  I learned from one of the participants and economists that the more that we allow...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:53">0:57:53-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  This is like, this is something to really, really take into consideration and give a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:00</a>:</strong>  lot of thought to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:00">0:58:00-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  The more we allow the economic disparity to grow, the more that we have people amassing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  wealth whose only interest in wealth is more wealth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:17</a>:</strong>  And wealthy people tend to keep so much of it available, just so much of it available<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:17">0:58:17-0:58:20</a>:</strong>  for them to be able to use that's fluid.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:20">0:58:20-0:58:25</a>:</strong>  For the most part, they bank it in investments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:25">0:58:25-0:58:30</a>:</strong>  Investments most often take the form of some kind of real estate development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:30">0:58:30-0:58:34</a>:</strong>  So if you have all of this cash out there that needs to be invested in order to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:34">0:58:34-0:58:40</a>:</strong>  more money, it causes the acceleration of gentrification because you're basically building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:40">0:58:40-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  all of these market rate housing units in order to provide an increasing return on investment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:58:53</a>:</strong>  So the more we allow the disparity to grow, the faster gentrification accelerates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:53">0:58:53-0:58:59</a>:</strong>  And all of that, of course, contributes tremendously to homelessness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:58:59">0:58:59-0:59:02</a>:</strong>  We have a madness going on right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:02">0:59:02-0:59:08</a>:</strong>  I think one of the anecdotes is for people to realize that people in the streets, all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:08">0:59:08-0:59:14</a>:</strong>  around them, are maybe one or two degrees removed from them in terms of relationships.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:14">0:59:14-0:59:18</a>:</strong>  I have actually experienced that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:18">0:59:18-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  I've actually met people that are the children of my father's and mother's own friends, people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:25">0:59:25-0:59:30</a>:</strong>  that I went to school with, but then I meet who are out in the streets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:30">0:59:30-0:59:34</a>:</strong>  And I learned something that happened to them in the course of their lives that I was close<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:34">0:59:34-0:59:38</a>:</strong>  to myself and I didn't realize what had happened to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:38">0:59:38-0:59:44</a>:</strong>  I've seen people run into each other in a car and get mad at each other in my own neighborhood<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:44">0:59:44-0:59:50</a>:</strong>  and start to fight, only to be pulled apart by their wives saying things like, don't you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:50">0:59:50-0:59:51</a>:</strong>  realize who you are?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:51">0:59:51-0:59:55</a>:</strong>  You guys used to be friends in school.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=0:59:55">0:59:55-1:00:01</a>:</strong>  But they're so far from remembering each other because of isolation or lack of continuity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:01">1:00:01-1:00:05</a>:</strong>  in their lives that they don't even realize that they just finally had a chance to meet<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:05">1:00:05-1:00:06</a>:</strong>  their old friend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:06">1:00:06-1:00:09</a>:</strong>  Unfortunately, it took a car accident to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:09">1:00:09-1:00:15</a>:</strong>  I'm going on and on about paradox here, but I think fundamentally for us to look at other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:15">1:00:15-1:00:18</a>:</strong>  people out in the street and just call them mere homeless people and treat them as if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:18">1:00:18-1:00:25</a>:</strong>  they're invisible pariahs or something is a terrible, terrible state of mind for us<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:25">1:00:25-1:00:26</a>:</strong>  all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:27</a>:</strong>  It's not just terrible for the homeless people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:27">1:00:27-1:00:31</a>:</strong>  For us to walk around in such ignorance, being oblivious to our fundamental connection to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:31">1:00:31-1:00:36</a>:</strong>  other people around us and all that we share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:36">1:00:36-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  I swear, even if they're homeless and you got a home, you're still cultural refugees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:46</a>:</strong>  I think the fact that you're even alive in the 21st century is a testament to your resilience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:46">1:00:46-1:00:50</a>:</strong>  that you've survived through all of these convolutions of human history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:50">1:00:50-1:00:55</a>:</strong>  I would rather walk around appreciating the fact that we're still here, that projecting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:55">1:00:55-1:00:59</a>:</strong>  onto each other and saying, oh, you're of a lesser class because you have less than<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:00:59">1:00:59-1:01:00</a>:</strong>  me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:00">1:01:00-1:01:05</a>:</strong>  That's like playing life as if it's a monopoly board game or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:05">1:01:05-1:01:10</a>:</strong>  I love that you reminded me that we're only maybe one, perhaps two steps removed from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:10">1:01:10-1:01:13</a>:</strong>  people of a situation of homelessness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:13">1:01:13-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  I was reminded of this recently when there was an emergency in my family and one of my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:18">1:01:18-1:01:20</a>:</strong>  brothers had to go to the hospital.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:20">1:01:20-1:01:25</a>:</strong>  Now it wasn't terribly major and he got out of there just fine, but realizing that he<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:25">1:01:25-1:01:31</a>:</strong>  doesn't have health insurance and a simple ambulance ride could put him into enough debt<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:31">1:01:31-1:01:34</a>:</strong>  that he couldn't pay his rent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:34">1:01:34-1:01:43</a>:</strong>  So many people these days are a very slim financial fall from having their entire livelihoods<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:43">1:01:43-1:01:45</a>:</strong>  at risk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:45">1:01:45-1:01:48</a>:</strong>  Goodness knows it's like that in so many other parts of the world as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:48">1:01:48-1:01:54</a>:</strong>  As we become more and more disconnected from our communities, we also disconnect from our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:54">1:01:54-1:01:56</a>:</strong>  systems of support.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:56">1:01:56-1:01:59</a>:</strong>  And so few people know their neighbors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:01:59">1:01:59-1:02:06</a>:</strong>  I realized in that emergency that we weren't terribly far from home without a phone to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:06">1:02:06-1:02:14</a>:</strong>  make a call or, you know, like I don't have any phone numbers memorized in my head anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:14">1:02:14-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  And I couldn't tell you the phone number of the neighbors or some of the close friends<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:21</a>:</strong>  of many of the people that I visited.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:21">1:02:21-1:02:26</a>:</strong>  You know, we've removed ourselves from having that as a part of us and have outsourced it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:26">1:02:26-1:02:31</a>:</strong>  to our electronic devices, which if those go like, I mean, anybody listening to this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:31">1:02:31-1:02:35</a>:</strong>  now, how many phone numbers, how many addresses do you have memorized anymore?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:35">1:02:35-1:02:39</a>:</strong>  You know, who could you reach out to if you didn't have an electronic connection like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:39">1:02:39-1:02:40</a>:</strong>  that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:40">1:02:40-1:02:44</a>:</strong>  And I think it's very important to remember that we are not so much different from people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:44">1:02:44-1:02:46</a>:</strong>  of those situations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:46">1:02:46-1:02:50</a>:</strong>  And perhaps one or two unfortunate circumstances could put us there as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:50">1:02:50-1:02:56</a>:</strong>  And definitely for me has helped to reconnect an amount of sympathy and compassion for people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:56">1:02:56-1:02:57</a>:</strong>  in those situations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:57">1:02:57-1:02:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:02:58">1:02:58-1:03:02</a>:</strong>  Well, here's another thought related to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:02">1:03:02-1:03:10</a>:</strong>  If we don't sit there using our brains to file away phone numbers or addresses or to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:10">1:03:10-1:03:18</a>:</strong>  be able to calculate basic math problems, it becomes an atrophy function of our mind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:18">1:03:18-1:03:25</a>:</strong>  I mean, I'm not saying that, you know, like we were biologically evolved to remember phone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:25">1:03:25-1:03:33</a>:</strong>  numbers specifically, but we have evolved with this intense capacity, incredible capacity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:33">1:03:33-1:03:40</a>:</strong>  for pattern observation and for integration of lots and lots and lots and lots and lots<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:40">1:03:40-1:03:41</a>:</strong>  of detailed information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:41">1:03:41-1:03:48</a>:</strong>  And the more that we outsource that to remote systems that we interact with, with the push<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:48">1:03:48-1:03:50</a>:</strong>  of a button, I think the stupider we become.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:50">1:03:50-1:03:58</a>:</strong>  You know, frankly, we also know that if your mind is not engaged in complex exercises,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:03:58">1:03:58-1:04:03</a>:</strong>  you become susceptible early in your life to things like dementia and Alzheimer's.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:03">1:04:03-1:04:06</a>:</strong>  So there's a lot of motivations for actually doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:06">1:04:06-1:04:12</a>:</strong>  But you know, I do that kind of stuff for an aesthetic experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:12">1:04:12-1:04:14</a>:</strong>  I don't want to not know things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:14">1:04:14-1:04:15</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:15">1:04:15-1:04:17</a>:</strong>  It's kind of weird to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:17">1:04:17-1:04:26</a>:</strong>  I'll be in a meeting and someone will, there'll be some sort of need to understand something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:26">1:04:26-1:04:30</a>:</strong>  and I'll calculate it in my mind right there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:30">1:04:30-1:04:33</a>:</strong>  And I'll say, oh, well, it's this number.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:33">1:04:33-1:04:36</a>:</strong>  And what's approximately this number.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:36">1:04:36-1:04:40</a>:</strong>  Or I'll remember a phone number and someone, some younger person will just be shocked that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:40">1:04:40-1:04:41</a>:</strong>  I can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:41">1:04:41-1:04:49</a>:</strong>  I'm really glad to be old enough to remember, you know, rotary phones, times before cell<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:49">1:04:49-1:04:54</a>:</strong>  phones, times before computers, because it really gives you context.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:04:54">1:04:54-1:05:00</a>:</strong>  I feel really scared for people who haven't known life before these systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:00">1:05:00-1:05:04</a>:</strong>  Well, I found it really useful because I mean, I don't remember some of those things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:04">1:05:04-1:05:09</a>:</strong>  you've mentioned, but I remember like cassette tapes and dialing phone numbers that you had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:09">1:05:09-1:05:10</a>:</strong>  to remember in your head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:10">1:05:10-1:05:17</a>:</strong>  And for nothing else, I think it just serves to remind us that before all of the convenience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:17">1:05:17-1:05:22</a>:</strong>  of technology that most of us enjoy and rely on now, people were fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:22">1:05:22-1:05:28</a>:</strong>  Like life went on and we didn't have to be connected in the way that we are now to live<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:28">1:05:28-1:05:29</a>:</strong>  richly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:29">1:05:29-1:05:34</a>:</strong>  And so I like to, you know, from my experience, practice other ways of living occasionally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:34">1:05:34-1:05:37</a>:</strong>  to make sure that I could still do without it if I had to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:37">1:05:37-1:05:44</a>:</strong>  But I actually want to read this to a couple of subjects that kind of are coalescing here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:44">1:05:44-1:05:50</a>:</strong>  And you've talked about this idea of becoming people of place or reindigenizing ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:50">1:05:50-1:05:55</a>:</strong>  And I had a previous conversation with Bill Reed, who is one of the co-founders of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:05:55">1:05:55-1:06:01</a>:</strong>  LEAD Building Certification Systems and one of the principles at the Regenesis Network.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:01">1:06:01-1:06:03</a>:</strong>  And he talked about him.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:03">1:06:03-1:06:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah, he also talked a lot about understanding the story of a place before starting to do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:09">1:06:09-1:06:13</a>:</strong>  any kind of design or make suggestions on a project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:13">1:06:13-1:06:18</a>:</strong>  And I know through your work, this is something that you put a lot of effort into it, understanding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:18">1:06:18-1:06:23</a>:</strong>  the story of the place and the context in which you're working before you start to put<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:23">1:06:23-1:06:25</a>:</strong>  pen to paper.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:25">1:06:25-1:06:31</a>:</strong>  And so I guess the question would be, what is like, how do you first start to gather<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:31">1:06:31-1:06:32</a>:</strong>  information?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:32">1:06:32-1:06:38</a>:</strong>  What do you look to inform you as to what is the story of the place and the context<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:38">1:06:38-1:06:41</a>:</strong>  that you're working in before you start to design?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:41">1:06:41-1:06:43</a>:</strong>  Great question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:43">1:06:43-1:06:44</a>:</strong>  Jeez.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:44">1:06:44-1:06:45</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:45">1:06:45-1:06:53</a>:</strong>  Well, a lot of times, even if I'm not asked to show up and help with a design project,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:06:53">1:06:53-1:07:00</a>:</strong>  this is something I'm always doing as I move through the city or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:00">1:07:00-1:07:06</a>:</strong>  I'll just stop and stand and I will feel, I will listen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:06">1:07:06-1:07:12</a>:</strong>  And I don't try to necessarily hear words or get specific images.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:12">1:07:12-1:07:22</a>:</strong>  I just stop and let my body and my ears, my mind feel and sense and let it come into me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:22">1:07:22-1:07:24</a>:</strong>  And then I know it will integrate itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:24">1:07:24-1:07:30</a>:</strong>  The information will integrate in me and then come out as an expression.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:30">1:07:30-1:07:36</a>:</strong>  So, you know, I would say that that's a permaculture behavior.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:36">1:07:36-1:07:41</a>:</strong>  It's not specifically outlined in any manual, except to say that you, you know, you, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:41">1:07:41-1:07:47</a>:</strong>  practice thoughtful and protect protracted observations, but the observation, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:47">1:07:47-1:07:55</a>:</strong>  that I do with my eyes and my body, walking cases, noticing slope, paying attention to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:55">1:07:55-1:07:59</a>:</strong>  the direction of the wind or the orientation of the sun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:07:59">1:07:59-1:08:04</a>:</strong>  I do that, but I also just stand and I feel and I listen because I figure, even though<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:04">1:08:04-1:08:12</a>:</strong>  I don't particularly believe in anything per se, in a mystical and spiritual way, I also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:12">1:08:12-1:08:16</a>:</strong>  know that there's more going on than I can understand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:16">1:08:16-1:08:19</a>:</strong>  So I don't, I don't, I don't use belief.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:19">1:08:19-1:08:25</a>:</strong>  I don't know, it sounds paradoxical, perhaps, but I know things are going on beyond any<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:25">1:08:25-1:08:30</a>:</strong>  sort of scale and depth that I can actually decipher.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:30">1:08:30-1:08:36</a>:</strong>  And at the same time, I don't specifically ground myself in one interpretation of how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:36">1:08:36-1:08:39</a>:</strong>  it's all working.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:39">1:08:39-1:08:41</a>:</strong>  So I'll just sit there and sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:41">1:08:41-1:08:50</a>:</strong>  Sometimes I'm sensing ancestors or descendants who are, you know, I am, I'm like, wow, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:50">1:08:50-1:08:57</a>:</strong>  kind of get a sense of people being back in time, blowing kisses forward into now, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:08:57">1:08:57-1:09:03</a>:</strong>  wishing us luck or people from the past encouraging us to do our best and try as hard as we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:03">1:09:03-1:09:06</a>:</strong>  because of how things turned out in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:06">1:09:06-1:09:08</a>:</strong>  So I'm on a site doing a design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:08">1:09:08-1:09:11</a>:</strong>  I'm doing, I do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:11">1:09:11-1:09:18</a>:</strong>  I just stand in it and I listen and I just try to absorb it without interpreting it mentally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:18">1:09:18-1:09:24</a>:</strong>  And then I let it come through in the insights I have as I'm working with people to work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:24">1:09:24-1:09:25</a>:</strong>  on a design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:25">1:09:25-1:09:31</a>:</strong>  And even then I'm listening, constantly listening and I'm listening acutely to other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:31">1:09:31-1:09:36</a>:</strong>  You know, the other people that are working with me on a project, they might not be as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:36">1:09:36-1:09:37</a>:</strong>  practiced at listening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:37">1:09:37-1:09:41</a>:</strong>  So it's very important for them to know whether they're practiced or not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:41">1:09:41-1:09:43</a>:</strong>  Everyone needs to know that they're heard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:43">1:09:43-1:09:50</a>:</strong>  So I'm constantly practicing a kind of a social technology or a social architecture of being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:50">1:09:50-1:09:53</a>:</strong>  receptive and inclusive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:53">1:09:53-1:09:58</a>:</strong>  And you know, they're thinking that I'm being the leader, but what they don't maybe understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:09:58">1:09:58-1:10:04</a>:</strong>  yet is my way of leading is to summarize, you know, to let everyone talk and say all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:04">1:10:04-1:10:08</a>:</strong>  the things that I would probably say anyway, but to let them say it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:08">1:10:08-1:10:11</a>:</strong>  And then I'm listening for what doesn't get heard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:11">1:10:11-1:10:15</a>:</strong>  So as I'm standing in a group, you know, there's plenty of intelligence there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:15">1:10:15-1:10:18</a>:</strong>  So they'll be talking about the direction of the wind or they'll be talking about the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:18">1:10:18-1:10:20</a>:</strong>  slope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:20">1:10:20-1:10:22</a>:</strong>  And I'm not there to try to correct anyone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:22">1:10:22-1:10:28</a>:</strong>  But if I hear people, you know, kind of not seeing something, you know, I might, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:28">1:10:28-1:10:31</a>:</strong>  ask them a question that helps them to see it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:31">1:10:31-1:10:34</a>:</strong>  I try not to be editing other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:34">1:10:34-1:10:35</a>:</strong>  But I'm just there to listen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:35">1:10:35-1:10:38</a>:</strong>  And the more that I listen, the richer I get.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:38">1:10:38-1:10:42</a>:</strong>  The more I listen, the more I actually hear.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:42">1:10:42-1:10:45</a>:</strong>  Before I was a good listener, there was so much that I wasn't hearing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:45">1:10:45-1:10:53</a>:</strong>  So I think, you know, practicing observation of my own feelings as I'm in that interaction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:53">1:10:53-1:10:58</a>:</strong>  So I guess I'm starting a kind of a sort of a deeper way of having insight here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:10:58">1:10:58-1:11:02</a>:</strong>  But I absolutely agree with Bill.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:02">1:11:02-1:11:09</a>:</strong>  This wouldn't necessarily make sense to some clients who aren't interested in respecting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:09">1:11:09-1:11:10</a>:</strong>  what has happened there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:10">1:11:10-1:11:15</a>:</strong>  But I think it's to people's detriment to not care.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:15">1:11:15-1:11:19</a>:</strong>  I mean, for one thing, physically, you need to like maybe you're on a landscape where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:19">1:11:19-1:11:22</a>:</strong>  everything's kind of been just wiped out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:22">1:11:22-1:11:23</a>:</strong>  It seems as if it's all been wiped out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:23">1:11:23-1:11:29</a>:</strong>  They wiped out the vegetation, they removed the fauna, they've erased the cultural patterns<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:29">1:11:29-1:11:30</a>:</strong>  from before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:30">1:11:30-1:11:33</a>:</strong>  So it doesn't really matter to look at what was there before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:33">1:11:33-1:11:35</a>:</strong>  Let's just build something new.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:35">1:11:35-1:11:41</a>:</strong>  Well, that kind of approach leads to things like sinkholes coming out of nowhere because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:41">1:11:41-1:11:47</a>:</strong>  you didn't bother to realize that in the violence that happened on the land, ways that water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:47">1:11:47-1:11:50</a>:</strong>  used to move has been obscured.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:50">1:11:50-1:11:53</a>:</strong>  Like you've filled a bunch of land where water used to flow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:53">1:11:53-1:11:56</a>:</strong>  Well, it's still flowing under that land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:11:56">1:11:56-1:12:00</a>:</strong>  You might put in a parking lot or a building and then have the parking lot or building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:00">1:12:00-1:12:05</a>:</strong>  fall into a hole because you didn't bother to find out that there's actually a stream<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:05">1:12:05-1:12:06</a>:</strong>  flowing there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:06">1:12:06-1:12:11</a>:</strong>  And besides, it really matters if there had been a village there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:11">1:12:11-1:12:16</a>:</strong>  You're building on bones, you're building on sacred gathering places.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:16">1:12:16-1:12:18</a>:</strong>  You need to understand what's there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:18">1:12:18-1:12:21</a>:</strong>  It might affect you spiritually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:21">1:12:21-1:12:27</a>:</strong>  Probably would affect you spiritually, especially if you, at the fun end, if you don't care,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:27">1:12:27-1:12:32</a>:</strong>  then not being a caring person who doesn't bother to know the story of a place is going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:32">1:12:32-1:12:37</a>:</strong>  to make you have a much less rich experience and you'll be more prone to make stupid choices<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:37">1:12:37-1:12:40</a>:</strong>  in the rest of your life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:40">1:12:40-1:12:45</a>:</strong>  So for the sake of one's own richness, and I say this to developers frequently, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:45">1:12:45-1:12:47</a>:</strong>  what is your legacy?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:47">1:12:47-1:12:52</a>:</strong>  Is all that you care about like going in, tearing down forests, building something and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:52">1:12:52-1:12:54</a>:</strong>  then cashing out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:54">1:12:54-1:12:56</a>:</strong>  Because you can't take it with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:12:56">1:12:56-1:13:00</a>:</strong>  You know, you have the opportunity to build a legacy and it won't cost you anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:00">1:13:00-1:13:05</a>:</strong>  We'll have a richer experience and people will actually like you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:05">1:13:05-1:13:09</a>:</strong>  Like how do you lose in that equation?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:09">1:13:09-1:13:15</a>:</strong>  So caring about what it used to be is a fundamental way of, you know, connecting to the meaning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:15">1:13:15-1:13:22</a>:</strong>  in your own life, not even to start talking about the sustainability of a project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:22">1:13:22-1:13:24</a>:</strong>  So I think Bill's absolutely right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:24">1:13:24-1:13:28</a>:</strong>  And he's talking about all the same things I am when I say all those things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:28">1:13:28-1:13:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:29">1:13:29-1:13:33</a>:</strong>  I mean, at this point, part of my job is just to see the similarities, the connectivities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:33">1:13:33-1:13:38</a>:</strong>  in these conversations that hopefully create a pattern that someone can suss out of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:38">1:13:38-1:13:41</a>:</strong>  larger body of work that this creates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:41">1:13:41-1:13:46</a>:</strong>  And certainly of people who have more experience and have been doing this longer, I've noticed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:46">1:13:46-1:13:54</a>:</strong>  that they really shy away from giving specific advice about techniques or design methodologies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:13:54">1:13:54-1:14:00</a>:</strong>  And they really focus on all of them talking about putting in the time to listen and to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:00">1:14:00-1:14:04</a>:</strong>  observe, almost to a T, like everybody who I really look up to and who has been doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:04">1:14:04-1:14:06</a>:</strong>  this for any period of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:06">1:14:06-1:14:12</a>:</strong>  That's the most common thread that I've noticed from their advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:12">1:14:12-1:14:17</a>:</strong>  Now, before we wrap it up, this is something that I'm starting to ask more and more people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:17">1:14:17-1:14:22</a>:</strong>  And I would imagine that you're going to have a good answer with all of these challenges<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:22">1:14:22-1:14:29</a>:</strong>  and seemingly insurmountable, I guess, issues of our time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:29">1:14:29-1:14:32</a>:</strong>  What keeps you going personally?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:32">1:14:32-1:14:37</a>:</strong>  I know that when we spoke last, you had just become a father and two years on, you've got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:37">1:14:37-1:14:40</a>:</strong>  a two year old kid and that's a big part of your life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:40">1:14:40-1:14:44</a>:</strong>  Is that one of the biggest influences and what motivates you moving forward?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:44">1:14:44-1:14:49</a>:</strong>  Or is there a larger sort of, I guess, motivation behind what you do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:49">1:14:49-1:14:57</a>:</strong>  Well, having a really brilliant little two year old daughter is like a lightning bolt<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:14:57">1:14:57-1:15:07</a>:</strong>  of beauty and inspiration that kind of shocks through everything that's going on, even the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:07">1:15:07-1:15:15</a>:</strong>  sort of fascist political insurgency that we see kind of trying to rise around the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:15">1:15:15-1:15:21</a>:</strong>  For me, on a personal level, she cuts right through that in terms of making me laugh and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:21">1:15:21-1:15:22</a>:</strong>  smile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:22">1:15:22-1:15:31</a>:</strong>  But it also, you know, that pretty quickly turns to heartbreak too, because I'm struggling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:31">1:15:31-1:15:38</a>:</strong>  to try to understand how or imagine how I am going to dovetail her innocence into an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:38">1:15:38-1:15:42</a>:</strong>  awareness of the state of the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:42">1:15:42-1:15:47</a>:</strong>  She's, she heard this term strong woman, she keeps running around saying, I am a strong<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:47">1:15:47-1:15:53</a>:</strong>  woman and then declaring what she can accomplish.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:53">1:15:53-1:15:56</a>:</strong>  So yeah, I know she's here to help.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:56">1:15:56-1:15:59</a>:</strong>  I'm pretty sure that's why she's here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:15:59">1:15:59-1:16:01</a>:</strong>  So she's helping me a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:01">1:16:01-1:16:03</a>:</strong>  I've got a lot of help.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:03">1:16:03-1:16:09</a>:</strong>  I've had, I'm really lucky to have had kind of activist and artist mentors through my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:09">1:16:09-1:16:17</a>:</strong>  life that have always helped me to see that that challenges our creative opportunity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:17">1:16:17-1:16:23</a>:</strong>  We certainly have the greatest creative opportunity plethora of compounding creative opportunities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:23">1:16:23-1:16:28</a>:</strong>  more than we could have ever asked for, you know, happening in our time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:28">1:16:28-1:16:35</a>:</strong>  But that's, it's both, you know, sort of heart rending and exciting at the same time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:35">1:16:35-1:16:38</a>:</strong>  Like we've never been quite as globalized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:38">1:16:38-1:16:41</a>:</strong>  There hasn't been as much, you know, like mutual understanding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:41">1:16:41-1:16:46</a>:</strong>  For some people, it comes in the form of, you know, noticing that there's a lot of Thai<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:46">1:16:46-1:16:51</a>:</strong>  restaurants around and Mexican food where before there were only hamburger joints.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:51">1:16:51-1:16:58</a>:</strong>  And you're, you know, you're seeing that there's this kind of cross-pollinization of culture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:16:58">1:16:58-1:17:02</a>:</strong>  whether it's literally represented by immigrants or people who have traveled to other countries<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:02">1:17:02-1:17:04</a>:</strong>  and found an appreciation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:04">1:17:04-1:17:12</a>:</strong>  Sometimes it starts just by being able to taste each other's, you know, culinary traditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:12">1:17:12-1:17:15</a>:</strong>  But there's so many other different ways and expressions where people have been coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:15">1:17:15-1:17:20</a>:</strong>  into contact and the world is starting to understand more about its story and whether<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:20">1:17:20-1:17:27</a>:</strong>  that's through genetics or the beneficial aspects of archaeology and history and learning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:27">1:17:27-1:17:29</a>:</strong>  so much about what we've been going through.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:29">1:17:29-1:17:35</a>:</strong>  And so I think we're in a really portentous time, you know, and all of that, of course,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:35">1:17:35-1:17:43</a>:</strong>  is threatening to the supremacist culture that has been persisting for so long and presenting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:43">1:17:43-1:17:47</a>:</strong>  us with so many of these challenges, really challenges by design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:47">1:17:47-1:17:53</a>:</strong>  I have to say, now that I know, I know that most of the problems we have in our society<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:53">1:17:53-1:17:59</a>:</strong>  are not, like we're always saying things like, oh, I'm only human.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:17:59">1:17:59-1:18:02</a>:</strong>  I think that's missing, that's really missing the point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:02">1:18:02-1:18:07</a>:</strong>  To be a human being, yeah, we're imperfect and we're failed and I love to understand,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:07">1:18:07-1:18:13</a>:</strong>  you know, I give myself a break all the time by knowing that really as a human being, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:13">1:18:13-1:18:18</a>:</strong>  have to really see everything as an experiment and I have to be ready to make a lot of mistakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:18">1:18:18-1:18:24</a>:</strong>  But not to get down on myself about that and to understand our creative proclivities are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:24">1:18:24-1:18:33</a>:</strong>  really in some ways kind of divine-like, like to be able to express the way that we do and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:33">1:18:33-1:18:39</a>:</strong>  to be able to take challenges and turn them into cultural evolution is an incredible,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:39">1:18:39-1:18:42</a>:</strong>  incredible capacity that we have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:42">1:18:42-1:18:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah, but the thing I was going to say that I've realized is that really all of our problems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:49">1:18:49-1:18:54</a>:</strong>  are a consequence of design choices that people make.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:54">1:18:54-1:18:57</a>:</strong>  The oligarch class has created homelessness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:18:57">1:18:57-1:19:00</a>:</strong>  The oligarch class has been misogynistic from the beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:00">1:19:00-1:19:06</a>:</strong>  They create a context where domestic violence can thrive, you know, basically, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:06">1:19:06-1:19:11</a>:</strong>  based upon taking men and turning them against their own families to make them dominators<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:11">1:19:11-1:19:16</a>:</strong>  or to turn them against their own communities and make them capitalizers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:16">1:19:16-1:19:20</a>:</strong>  These systems aren't accidental and they end up making the people who think that they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:20">1:19:20-1:19:25</a>:</strong>  profiting off of it the most crazy and the most miserable of all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:25">1:19:25-1:19:29</a>:</strong>  So you know, I understand that as a designer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:29">1:19:29-1:19:35</a>:</strong>  I just hope that we figure out a way to address these design issues in time so that we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:35">1:19:35-1:19:37</a>:</strong>  continue into the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:37">1:19:37-1:19:43</a>:</strong>  And I'm excited by the challenge even as my heart is breaking because of all of the unnecessary<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:43">1:19:43-1:19:45</a>:</strong>  pain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:45">1:19:45-1:19:48</a>:</strong>  But here's like another piece of the answer to your question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:48">1:19:48-1:19:52</a>:</strong>  I've gone out and I literally have asked people what is wrong with my country and what is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:52">1:19:52-1:19:54</a>:</strong>  wrong with me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:54">1:19:54-1:19:59</a>:</strong>  And what I've got is the most beautiful, like empathetic sisterhood and brotherhood back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:19:59">1:19:59-1:20:02</a>:</strong>  in return.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:02">1:20:02-1:20:06</a>:</strong>  One time I was in a Mayan village and I was like, can you tell me what is wrong with me?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:06">1:20:06-1:20:08</a>:</strong>  Can you tell me what is wrong with my country?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:08">1:20:08-1:20:13</a>:</strong>  And they're like, first of all, you need to realize, like I'm sitting there apologizing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:13">1:20:13-1:20:19</a>:</strong>  for basically European invasion and this person's like, no, you cannot take this upon yourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:19">1:20:19-1:20:21</a>:</strong>  And I'm like, what are you talking about?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:21">1:20:21-1:20:23</a>:</strong>  Look at what Europe has done to this place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:23">1:20:23-1:20:24</a>:</strong>  Look at what we have done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:24">1:20:24-1:20:30</a>:</strong>  And he's like, no, you only did this to us because it was done to you so long ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:30">1:20:30-1:20:33</a>:</strong>  You don't even know who you are anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:33">1:20:33-1:20:35</a>:</strong>  Your people don't know who you are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:35">1:20:35-1:20:37</a>:</strong>  You don't remember the villages that were destroyed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:37">1:20:37-1:20:40</a>:</strong>  You don't know that you were attacked and subsumed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:40">1:20:40-1:20:44</a>:</strong>  You were turned into people who would go out and attack other people at the cost of your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:44">1:20:44-1:20:49</a>:</strong>  own humanity and experience of family.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:49">1:20:49-1:20:51</a>:</strong>  And I'm sitting there crying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:51">1:20:51-1:20:55</a>:</strong>  I can't even believe the kind of love that this person is giving back to me and all this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:55">1:20:55-1:20:56</a>:</strong>  understanding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:20:56">1:20:56-1:21:01</a>:</strong>  Then he explains the colonial grid and he says, go back home to where you grew up and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:01">1:21:01-1:21:04</a>:</strong>  stand in a street intersection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:04">1:21:04-1:21:09</a>:</strong>  Look at all the lines that are so flat and straight and see how this is a huge design<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:09">1:21:09-1:21:16</a>:</strong>  construct city by city, everywhere people are isolated by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:16">1:21:16-1:21:23</a>:</strong>  So yeah, I got to have an insight on the way that design can sometimes be monumental and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:23">1:21:23-1:21:34</a>:</strong>  enormous in the sweeping scale of ambition to control, to eliminate cultures and replace<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:34">1:21:34-1:21:41</a>:</strong>  them with a giant kind of development concept that just will benefit the few.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:41">1:21:41-1:21:46</a>:</strong>  So I guess you asked me what keeps me going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:46">1:21:46-1:21:47</a>:</strong>  Part of it is outrage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:47">1:21:47-1:21:53</a>:</strong>  Like I see that we're, every one of us, including rich people are swept up in something so big<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:53">1:21:53-1:21:54</a>:</strong>  we no longer understand it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:21:54">1:21:54-1:22:00</a>:</strong>  And it's so painful to us, maybe especially rich people because they ended up being impoverished<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:00">1:22:00-1:22:07</a>:</strong>  spiritually, but it's beyond comprehension and it's tragedy is beyond our ability to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:07">1:22:07-1:22:08</a>:</strong>  grasp.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:08">1:22:08-1:22:11</a>:</strong>  So there's that, I'm motivated by that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:11">1:22:11-1:22:15</a>:</strong>  And on the other hand, on the other side of the tragedy, and this is something that this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:15">1:22:15-1:22:20</a>:</strong>  same Mayan person said to me, he held up his hands like this side of my palm is everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:20">1:22:20-1:22:24</a>:</strong>  that's wrong that obscures us from seeing what's on the other side of my palm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:24">1:22:24-1:22:29</a>:</strong>  And he turns his hand around and he's like on this side is to see the luminous reality<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:29">1:22:29-1:22:33</a>:</strong>  that we are on a floating garden sphere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:33">1:22:33-1:22:38</a>:</strong>  The only life that we know of in all the cosmos is here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:38">1:22:38-1:22:39</a>:</strong>  This is home.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:39">1:22:39-1:22:40</a>:</strong>  We are home.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:40">1:22:40-1:22:42</a>:</strong>  We are all home together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:42">1:22:42-1:22:46</a>:</strong>  And if we can see that everything is here and that everything that we need is provided<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:46">1:22:46-1:22:52</a>:</strong>  for to us as a gift and an expression of love, if we can see that we are all leaves on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:52">1:22:52-1:22:57</a>:</strong>  tree of life and somehow act from a place of seeing our larger self with each other,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:22:57">1:22:57-1:23:02</a>:</strong>  then we will be okay and we will thrive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:02">1:23:02-1:23:07</a>:</strong>  And to like glimpse, you know, the possibility of actually inhabiting that awareness and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:07">1:23:07-1:23:13</a>:</strong>  taking care of each other and going to new levels of aesthetic appreciation and experience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:13">1:23:13-1:23:18</a>:</strong>  with each other like that, however, that's what's keeping me going is to see what's on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:18">1:23:18-1:23:27</a>:</strong>  the other side of all of this despair is all of this like promise, birthright.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:27">1:23:27-1:23:29</a>:</strong>  That inspires me constantly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:29">1:23:29-1:23:33</a>:</strong>  All the way till I'm dust, I'll be inspired by that because I already know that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:33">1:23:33-1:23:37</a>:</strong>  Like, oh my God, we live in the most amazing place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:37">1:23:37-1:23:38</a>:</strong>  That gets me up every morning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:38">1:23:38-1:23:39</a>:</strong>  Even the tragedy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:39">1:23:39-1:23:40</a>:</strong>  That's the thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:40">1:23:40-1:23:45</a>:</strong>  Like we go to Mars, sifting through dust, looking for one organic molecule, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:45">1:23:45-1:23:52</a>:</strong>  and then we come back here and we're like, all around us, we're surrounded by evidence<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:52">1:23:52-1:23:54</a>:</strong>  of the miraculous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:54">1:23:54-1:23:57</a>:</strong>  And I feel that pretty much every day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:57">1:23:57-1:23:58</a>:</strong>  It's it's it would be a hell of a lot better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:23:58">1:23:58-1:24:05</a>:</strong>  There's billions of us were seeing that together because that cumulative celebration would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:05">1:24:05-1:24:09</a>:</strong>  be the best thing we ever experienced.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:09">1:24:09-1:24:12</a>:</strong>  So that keeps me going to have that with each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:12">1:24:12-1:24:13</a>:</strong>  Well said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:13">1:24:13-1:24:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I, I deeply resonate with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:17">1:24:17-1:24:20</a>:</strong>  I really like the way that you put it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:20">1:24:20-1:24:26</a>:</strong>  And I think it's a marvelous transition now to have you tell our listeners on that note,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:26">1:24:26-1:24:30</a>:</strong>  how they can get in touch with you or your organizations and learn more about your work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:30">1:24:30-1:24:31</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:31">1:24:31-1:24:34</a>:</strong>  Okay, well, you know, there's different websites.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:34">1:24:34-1:24:40</a>:</strong>  I think the best thing to do is to come to Portland, invite you all to Portland at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:40">1:24:40-1:24:47</a>:</strong>  end of May in the beginning of June for our 10 day annual gigantic permaculture barn raising<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:47">1:24:47-1:24:51</a>:</strong>  called the village building convergence that happens every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:51">1:24:51-1:24:59</a>:</strong>  It'll happen next year for 10 days and come to Portland and see how sort of like 40 simultaneous<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:24:59">1:24:59-1:25:04</a>:</strong>  projects can happen over the course of 10 days and everyone's organizing it themselves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:04">1:25:04-1:25:09</a>:</strong>  and revolutionizing their, their, their, their environments as expressions of urban permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:09">1:25:09-1:25:11</a>:</strong>  So come be a part of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:11">1:25:11-1:25:13</a>:</strong>  And we actually have a school during that time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:13">1:25:13-1:25:19</a>:</strong>  So people can actually come and learn together and then go out and be part of the projects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:19">1:25:19-1:25:24</a>:</strong>  and then at night come and dance and sing and learn and express and eat together in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:24">1:25:24-1:25:27</a>:</strong>  a central village that we create.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:27">1:25:27-1:25:31</a>:</strong>  So it's really taking like the idea of festival culture, bringing it into the city to just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:31">1:25:31-1:25:36</a>:</strong>  blossom in the forms of permanent change so that you can find out more about that at village<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:36">1:25:36-1:25:43</a>:</strong>  building, convergence.com or at city repair.org.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:43">1:25:43-1:25:48</a>:</strong>  And you could also go to, um, so you could also go to planet repair.org.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:48">1:25:48-1:25:53</a>:</strong>  There's a little bit there that's where city repair began.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:53">1:25:53-1:25:58</a>:</strong>  Um, and then you can also for our design for design projects from a different organization<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:25:58">1:25:58-1:26:04</a>:</strong>  where we're doing things like villages buy in for people, um, contending with Asperger's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:04">1:26:04-1:26:08</a>:</strong>  or autistic permaculture based autistic village.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:08">1:26:08-1:26:15</a>:</strong>  Um, and lots and lots of prototypes building entire buildings made out of recycled materials,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:15">1:26:15-1:26:20</a>:</strong>  all kinds of natural building projects, all kinds of ecological, social ecological projects,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:20">1:26:20-1:26:26</a>:</strong>  go to communitecture.net and you can see lots of that's larger scale designs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:26">1:26:26-1:26:31</a>:</strong>  City repair is more like the systemic change involving massive amounts of social culture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:31">1:26:31-1:26:34</a>:</strong>  doing projects that are prototypical.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:34">1:26:34-1:26:41</a>:</strong>  Communitecture's funded projects larger at physical scales, not as much social fusion,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:41">1:26:41-1:26:44</a>:</strong>  but still lots of participatory culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:44">1:26:44-1:26:46</a>:</strong>  So those two are sisters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:46">1:26:46-1:26:49</a>:</strong>  They inhabit the same building where I am right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:49">1:26:49-1:26:54</a>:</strong>  Um, and they're part of a network of people that are all working on change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:54">1:26:54-1:26:56</a>:</strong>  Excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:26:56">1:26:56-1:27:01</a>:</strong>  And yeah, for those of you who are interested in that, um, village building convergence,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:01">1:27:01-1:27:05</a>:</strong>  so many of the natural builders that I've focused on and then interviewed here on this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:05">1:27:05-1:27:11</a>:</strong>  podcast have done small workshops or, you know, little tutorials during that building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:11">1:27:11-1:27:13</a>:</strong>  convergence.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:13">1:27:13-1:27:15</a>:</strong>  And a lot of you can participate in those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:15">1:27:15-1:27:19</a>:</strong>  I think, you know, through that website that you mentioned, you can sign up to some of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:19">1:27:19-1:27:25</a>:</strong>  them early on, and it's a great way to get a little crash course in practical projects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:25">1:27:25-1:27:29</a>:</strong>  that can get your hands dirty on a lot of different types of natural building materials<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:29">1:27:29-1:27:30</a>:</strong>  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:30">1:27:30-1:27:31</a>:</strong>  Beautiful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:31">1:27:31-1:27:32</a>:</strong>  Excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:32">1:27:32-1:27:34</a>:</strong>  Mark, again, thank you so much for taking the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:34">1:27:34-1:27:36</a>:</strong>  It's always a pleasure to catch up with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:36">1:27:36-1:27:41</a>:</strong>  And I've loved the content and the projects that you've been publishing and putting out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:41">1:27:41-1:27:43</a>:</strong>  online for the last couple of years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:43">1:27:43-1:27:48</a>:</strong>  It's been a big inspiration for me and the general dialogue that you helped to create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:48">1:27:48-1:27:54</a>:</strong>  around compassionate understanding of place and identity that can overcome this violent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:54">1:27:54-1:27:59</a>:</strong>  infrastructure that many of us operate in is a real inspiration to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-mark-lakeman/#t=1:27:59">1:27:59-1:28:02</a>:</strong>  So I just wanted to thank you for that and for giving us your time today.<br />
