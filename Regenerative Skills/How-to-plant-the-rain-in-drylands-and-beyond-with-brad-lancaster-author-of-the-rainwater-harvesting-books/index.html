<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:47">0:01:47-0:01:53</a>:</strong>  Alright, so in the last handful of episodes, we've explored permaculture earthworks for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:53">0:01:53-0:01:57</a>:</strong>  water harvesting landscapes and keyline design on large scales.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:01:57">0:01:57-0:02:02</a>:</strong>  As a complement to those topics, I got in touch with Brad Lancaster, the author of Rainwater<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:02">0:02:02-0:02:07</a>:</strong>  Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond, both volumes 1 and 2, which have recently been re-released<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:07">0:02:07-0:02:10</a>:</strong>  and expanded in new editions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:10">0:02:10-0:02:13</a>:</strong>  Brad is an expert in the field of rainwater harvesting and water management, and whose<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:13">0:02:13-0:02:16</a>:</strong>  work I've been following for a long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:16">0:02:16-0:02:20</a>:</strong>  He's also a permaculture teacher, designer, consultant, and co-founder of the nonprofit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:20">0:02:20-0:02:25</a>:</strong>  Desert Harvesters, which teaches the public how to identify, harvest, and process many<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:25">0:02:25-0:02:28</a>:</strong>  of the native food plants endemic to the arid southwestern US.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:28">0:02:28-0:02:33</a>:</strong>  He's also been instrumental in helping to change water management policy and government<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:33">0:02:33-0:02:38</a>:</strong>  incentives in the city of Tucson to help others implement waterwise catchment and reuse features<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:38">0:02:38-0:02:40</a>:</strong>  on their properties.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:40">0:02:40-0:02:45</a>:</strong>  In this interview, we cover a wide range of topics, from the difference between active<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:45">0:02:45-0:02:49</a>:</strong>  and passive water harvesting technology, and reading the landscape to determine how to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:49">0:02:49-0:02:53</a>:</strong>  work with the natural surroundings, to the increasing importance for water stewardship<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:53">0:02:53-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  in non-arid climates, and why it's so important to connect and invest in the place you already<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:04</a>:</strong>  live rather than thinking that moving to another place will solve your environmental worries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:04">0:03:04-0:03:09</a>:</strong>  Brad also gives great advice on home-scale water harvesting and storage, which are all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:09">0:03:09-0:03:13</a>:</strong>  topics that are covered extensively in his books, and he's done an incredible job with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:13">0:03:13-0:03:17</a>:</strong>  the help of many experts and collaborators to compile tons of resources that are available<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:23">0:03:23-0:03:25</a>:</strong>  So from here, I'll hand the discussion over to Brad.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:36">0:03:36-0:03:41</a>:</strong>  to go into your background, it's super well-documented in so many other places, so I'll open with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:41">0:03:41-0:03:46</a>:</strong>  a question that you've talked about in the past and has really kind of sunk in for me,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:46">0:03:46-0:03:51</a>:</strong>  and that's the importance of committing to where you are and investing in your home's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:51">0:03:51-0:03:54</a>:</strong>  health and regeneration for the long term.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:03:54">0:03:54-0:04:00</a>:</strong>  I know that's a realization that you made pretty early on, and before had been thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:00">0:04:00-0:04:04</a>:</strong>  about leaving the Tucson area and maybe looking for greener pastures, so to speak.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:10</a>:</strong>  Can you talk a little about why you decided to stay and invest in your local area?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:10">0:04:10-0:04:18</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, the person that I guess really solidified that decision for me was this African<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:18">0:04:18-0:04:23</a>:</strong>  water farmer, Mr. Zephaniah Pirimiseko, who was a huge mentor for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:23">0:04:23-0:04:32</a>:</strong>  Even though I spent very little time in the scope of life with him, just a matter of days,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:32">0:04:32-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  he was very instrumental in my direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:44</a>:</strong>  So I was blown away by what he had done by committing to make change where change was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:44">0:04:44-0:04:52</a>:</strong>  most possible in his own life and on he and his family's own site.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:04:52">0:04:52-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  And they turned what had been just an eroding piece of land that was not productive into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:02">0:05:02-0:05:11</a>:</strong>  a relative oasis simply by planting the rain, stewarding more life in a way that gave back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:11">0:05:11-0:05:18</a>:</strong>  far more than it took from the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:18">0:05:18-0:05:26</a>:</strong>  It was extremely inspirational because he had very little resources and yet did incredible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:26">0:05:26-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  work, far better work than I've seen many people with a lot of resources do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:31">0:05:31-0:05:41</a>:</strong>  And so after spending a day with him, I started venting some of my frustrations of how bad<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:41">0:05:41-0:05:46</a>:</strong>  I saw things going in my hometown of Tucson, Arizona and how we had been depleting our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:46">0:05:46-0:05:50</a>:</strong>  water resources, our soil fertility and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:50">0:05:50-0:05:54</a>:</strong>  And I told him I didn't want to be part of that problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:05:54">0:05:54-0:06:00</a>:</strong>  And so I was thinking of leaving and asked him for some advice of where I might consider<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:00">0:06:00-0:06:01</a>:</strong>  going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:01">0:06:01-0:06:02</a>:</strong>  And he was very clear.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:02">0:06:02-0:06:09</a>:</strong>  He said, no, you have to go home and you have to set your roots deeper than you ever thought<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:09">0:06:09-0:06:13</a>:</strong>  possible because if you run from your problems, you're just going to plant problems everywhere<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:13">0:06:13-0:06:14</a>:</strong>  you go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:14">0:06:14-0:06:20</a>:</strong>  So you've got to instead try and figure out how can you turn these problems into solutions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:20">0:06:20-0:06:27</a>:</strong>  And if you're able to do that, then you can go anywhere because you'll have that ability<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:27">0:06:27-0:06:30</a>:</strong>  to shift problems into solutions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:30">0:06:30-0:06:39</a>:</strong>  So for whatever reason, I was very ready for that at that time and went home to make that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:39">0:06:39-0:06:46</a>:</strong>  commitment and not knowing exactly how I was going to turn things around, but I did have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:46">0:06:46-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  the inspiration of the work of Mr. Piri and his family.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:55</a>:</strong>  And I came home to figure out, well, how can I tweak that to the unique conditions of my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:55">0:06:55-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  site?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:03</a>:</strong>  And I've just found over time that it's been very rewarding and definitely challenging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:03">0:07:03-0:07:05</a>:</strong>  at times too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:05">0:07:05-0:07:13</a>:</strong>  But no matter how bad something goes out in the world, in a meeting, in an interaction,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:13">0:07:13-0:07:21</a>:</strong>  what have you, I can come home and I can see things going in the right direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:21">0:07:21-0:07:28</a>:</strong>  Even if it's small, even if it's only the growth of a few leaves out of a budding tree,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:28">0:07:28-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  that's still going in the right direction and is very uplifting for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:40</a>:</strong>  And I'm able to learn on a daily basis with what is right outside my door.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:40">0:07:40-0:07:43</a>:</strong>  So it's very direct, very immediate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:43">0:07:43-0:07:50</a>:</strong>  And I've found it's been powerful and inspiring others because they see, oh, you're doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:50">0:07:50-0:07:58</a>:</strong>  this on your home scale, your neighborhood scale, which then links and informs the community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:07:58">0:07:58-0:08:02</a>:</strong>  scale and they see I can do that too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:02">0:08:02-0:08:04</a>:</strong>  So yeah, it's empowering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  I love that story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:08</a>:</strong>  And it's been one of the reasons why I've connected with your work a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:08">0:08:08-0:08:10</a>:</strong>  I mean, I've been traveling my whole life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:10">0:08:10-0:08:12</a>:</strong>  I was born in Japan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:12">0:08:12-0:08:16</a>:</strong>  I grew up mostly in Minnesota and I live in Spain now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:16">0:08:16-0:08:22</a>:</strong>  Before I came here, I was doing projects in Guatemala and in Senegal and in the Philippines.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:22">0:08:22-0:08:27</a>:</strong>  As much as I love everything that I've learned and gained from the traveling experience,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:27">0:08:27-0:08:32</a>:</strong>  I've also noticed that everywhere I go, I sort of bring my own baggage and my own problems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:32">0:08:32-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  with me where they find a way of manifesting in whatever new situation that I find myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:43</a>:</strong>  Life gives you lessons that you need to learn and you can't run away from them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:43">0:08:43-0:08:49</a>:</strong>  And sort of putting in roots, like you said, digging those roots down ever deeper is the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:49">0:08:49-0:08:54</a>:</strong>  way that I have found to not just gain insight that you never would have from an outside<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:08:54">0:08:54-0:09:01</a>:</strong>  perspective coming into a project and giving advice on it and just applying the cold science<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:01">0:09:01-0:09:07</a>:</strong>  of restoration, but understanding the people and learning the story of place and becoming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:07">0:09:07-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  a part of the community that you are trying to influence plays so much of a part in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:20</a>:</strong>  process that I would almost say that it's a much bigger part than the actual techniques<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:20">0:09:20-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  or the work done on the ground because of all of the emergent properties of those connections<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:29</a>:</strong>  that don't necessarily start to come out in the beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:29">0:09:29-0:09:33</a>:</strong>  It's something that takes a little while to establish and it's just one of the parts of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:33">0:09:33-0:09:37</a>:</strong>  your message that has always resonated with me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:37">0:09:37-0:09:43</a>:</strong>  But with that said, let's go into talking about the two forms of water harvesting, both<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:43">0:09:43-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  active and passive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:45">0:09:45-0:09:48</a>:</strong>  And if you could give me a little overview of the differences between those and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:48">0:09:48-0:09:50</a>:</strong>  we'll explore them deeper.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:50">0:09:50-0:09:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:51">0:09:51-0:09:58</a>:</strong>  So active is where people most often go when they first hear about water harvesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:09:58">0:09:58-0:10:06</a>:</strong>  And that would be a system with a tank and a valve on it because somebody has to actively<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:06">0:10:06-0:10:10</a>:</strong>  turn on or off that valve for the system to work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:10">0:10:10-0:10:15</a>:</strong>  So water can be released from the tank.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:15">0:10:15-0:10:17</a>:</strong>  And it doesn't have to be a person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:17">0:10:17-0:10:25</a>:</strong>  It could be a mechanical timer, but still that mechanical timer is dependent on a person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:25">0:10:25-0:10:34</a>:</strong>  And so active systems tend to be more expensive and they're reliant on manufactured or built<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:34">0:10:34-0:10:38</a>:</strong>  elements.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:38">0:10:38-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  Whereas a passive system, that tends to be a living system where your tank is now, say<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:10:54</a>:</strong>  the soil and the vegetation as opposed to a manufactured tank.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:54">0:10:54-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  So what that would look like, a passive system would be like a rain garden where you've got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:06</a>:</strong>  this basin in the landscape that's lower than the surrounding area or hardscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:06">0:11:06-0:11:11</a>:</strong>  And the runoff from the surrounding area is directed to that basin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:11">0:11:11-0:11:16</a>:</strong>  So you might direct roof runoff to it, maybe street runoff, maybe just runoff from the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  adjoining landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:22</a>:</strong>  So there's a greater concentration of water there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:30</a>:</strong>  And then you are collaborating with soil life to create a much more absorbent living sponge<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:30">0:11:30-0:11:36</a>:</strong>  of fertile high organic matter soil so that you're not storing the water on the soil,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:36">0:11:36-0:11:38</a>:</strong>  on top of the soil like a pond.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:38">0:11:38-0:11:43</a>:</strong>  Instead, you're rapidly infiltrating it so it's subsurface storage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:43">0:11:43-0:11:47</a>:</strong>  That way you don't lose water to evaporation as you would with a pond.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:47">0:11:47-0:11:51</a>:</strong>  You don't have an issue of breeding mosquitoes because there's no standing water in which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:51">0:11:51-0:11:55</a>:</strong>  mosquitoes can breed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:12:00</a>:</strong>  And then how do you access that water that's now stored subsurface?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:00">0:12:00-0:12:03</a>:</strong>  You plant pumps in the form of vegetation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:03">0:12:03-0:12:10</a>:</strong>  So you can utilize and access that water in the form of fruit, food production, livestock<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:10">0:12:10-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  fodder, wildlife habitat, shelter, shade, and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:15">0:12:15-0:12:24</a>:</strong>  And that passive strategy also helps recharge our groundwater, which recharges our springs,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:24">0:12:24-0:12:26</a>:</strong>  our creeks, and our rivers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:26">0:12:26-0:12:31</a>:</strong>  So it helps recharge surface waters as well in that sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:31">0:12:31-0:12:39</a>:</strong>  And I find that passive strategies tend to have a much higher capacity than active strategies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:39">0:12:39-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  Because once your manufactured tank is full, until you empty it, you can't add any more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:47</a>:</strong>  water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:47">0:12:47-0:12:56</a>:</strong>  Whereas a rain garden, an earthwork, it is infiltrating water constantly and making more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:56">0:12:56-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  capacity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:13:02</a>:</strong>  And the more vegetation and the more life you have, the more it cycles and pumps that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:02">0:13:02-0:13:04</a>:</strong>  water more quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:04">0:13:04-0:13:13</a>:</strong>  So I find, like let's say if we get a two inch rainstorm one day, all my tanks are full.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:13">0:13:13-0:13:16</a>:</strong>  And all my rain gardens, they fill up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:16">0:13:16-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  But in a matter of a couple hours, all the water is infiltrated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:23</a>:</strong>  And they're ready for another two inch storm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:23">0:13:23-0:13:27</a>:</strong>  Just a couple hours after that initial two inch storm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:27">0:13:27-0:13:33</a>:</strong>  Whereas those tanks won't be ready for another two inch storm until I've emptied them, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:33">0:13:33-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  is going to be weeks later.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:43</a>:</strong>  So I find the passive strategies tend to be far more effective at flood control as well<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:43">0:13:43-0:13:47</a>:</strong>  as water resiliency and getting you through dry times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:54</a>:</strong>  And I find the passive systems tend to be far more multifunctional.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:54">0:13:54-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  Because they're growing so much more life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:00</a>:</strong>  They're growing resources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:00">0:14:00-0:14:05</a>:</strong>  Tanks themselves aren't growing so many resources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:05">0:14:05-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  The water released from them can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:10</a>:</strong>  But again, it's not as high a capacity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:10">0:14:10-0:14:13</a>:</strong>  It's not as high a volume as the passive systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:13">0:14:13-0:14:15</a>:</strong>  So I use the two together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:15">0:14:15-0:14:20</a>:</strong>  So if you're going to put in a tank system, make sure at a minimum you always overflow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:20">0:14:20-0:14:24</a>:</strong>  its water to a passive system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:24">0:14:24-0:14:26</a>:</strong>  Earthworks, rain gardens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:26">0:14:26-0:14:31</a>:</strong>  So you're making the most of the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:31">0:14:31-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  And I just wanted to jump really quick to what we were discussing before about committing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:43</a>:</strong>  to place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:43">0:14:43-0:14:50</a>:</strong>  I love to try and find both historical active and passive systems in my area to see what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:50">0:14:50-0:14:54</a>:</strong>  worked for the people in this local climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:54">0:14:54-0:14:57</a>:</strong>  So that's a great thing to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:14:57">0:14:57-0:15:01</a>:</strong>  But that process also further connects me to place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:01">0:15:01-0:15:04</a>:</strong>  Because I start learning more about the place's history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:04">0:15:04-0:15:07</a>:</strong>  The cultural and traditional lineages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:07">0:15:07-0:15:09</a>:</strong>  The ecological lineages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:09">0:15:09-0:15:18</a>:</strong>  So I have found historic wetlands, Cienega's, and whatnot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:18">0:15:18-0:15:29</a>:</strong>  And I get to learn from how these wetter microclimates in my area, what enabled them to get established?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:29">0:15:29-0:15:33</a>:</strong>  What enabled them to grow?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:33">0:15:33-0:15:37</a>:</strong>  What damaged them at some point in their history and minimized their size?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:37">0:15:37-0:15:45</a>:</strong>  All that is other great learning that can inform how I design and steward my strategies<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:45">0:15:45-0:15:47</a>:</strong>  back home and in my neighborhood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:47">0:15:47-0:15:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's a very good point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:49">0:15:49-0:15:53</a>:</strong>  And that's one of the things I've enjoyed most about the design process that I've done<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:53">0:15:53-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  for my own projects and that I've helped other clients through as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:02</a>:</strong>  Is that simply by doing it, you're actually expanding your participation in these other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:02">0:16:02-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  aspects that maybe you didn't set out to get involved in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:11</a>:</strong>  But are inevitably going to make it a richer experience and a more resilient design by<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:11">0:16:11-0:16:17</a>:</strong>  having investigated and put yourself into the process itself?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:17">0:16:17-0:16:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:21">0:16:21-0:16:23</a>:</strong>  Just to share one little story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:23">0:16:23-0:16:32</a>:</strong>  So I had a client that was all set on active tank systems when he called me for a consultation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:32">0:16:32-0:16:39</a>:</strong>  And I went out to his site and saw that his roof surface was pretty low quality, not that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:39">0:16:39-0:16:40</a>:</strong>  big.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:40">0:16:40-0:16:46</a>:</strong>  And he wanted the water for irrigation, not for domestic use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:46">0:16:46-0:16:49</a>:</strong>  So it didn't really seem a priority to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:49">0:16:49-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  Whereas I saw he had a little dry waterway, ephemeral waterway or ROYO as we call it on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:16:57</a>:</strong>  his property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:16:57">0:16:57-0:17:01</a>:</strong>  And he had a lot of exposed bedrock from years of erosion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:01">0:17:01-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  So I realized, wow, this guy's site is ripe for passive earthworks like one rock dams<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:12</a>:</strong>  and so on that we could build on top of that bedrock.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:12">0:17:12-0:17:17</a>:</strong>  And we can create these amazing sponges and even potentially create ephemeral springs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:17">0:17:17-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  on his property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:27</a>:</strong>  And saw a little example, a very small scale of where this had actually happened, where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:27">0:17:27-0:17:36</a>:</strong>  some rocks had just accumulated and locked themselves in the drainage, creating a small<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:36">0:17:36-0:17:40</a>:</strong>  one rock dam, if you will, behind which a lot of organic matter accumulated, creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:40">0:17:40-0:17:44</a>:</strong>  this sponge that held on to the water much longer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:44">0:17:44-0:17:50</a>:</strong>  And sure enough, he relayed to me that after good rain, water would seep out of that area<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:50">0:17:50-0:17:52</a>:</strong>  for a number of days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:52">0:17:52-0:17:55</a>:</strong>  So it's like, great, there's the example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:17:55">0:17:55-0:18:01</a>:</strong>  Now we can just build on this and improve it so you can have ephemeral springs that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  last for weeks as opposed to days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:07</a>:</strong>  And that's the direction we took and that was the result.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:07">0:18:07-0:18:08</a>:</strong>  That's amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:08">0:18:08-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's so inspiring to see when you kind of have that understanding of what is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:20</a>:</strong>  possible and put in the necessary features or make the amendments or yeah, the little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:20">0:18:20-0:18:23</a>:</strong>  changes that are required and then nature takes over from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and each year we go back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:27">0:18:27-0:18:28</a>:</strong>  It's better and better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:28">0:18:28-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  Whereas every year you go back to see a tank, it doesn't get any better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  No, it's on a road towards not centripetal entropy, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:42</a>:</strong>  All of your built environment stuff, your mechanical solutions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:42">0:18:42-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  And most of them are just trying to imitate much more efficient and effective elements<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  in nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:18:52</a>:</strong>  Like you mentioned the pump system bringing water up from the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:52">0:18:52-0:18:56</a>:</strong>  Well, in the best case scenario, maybe you've got a high quality, high efficiency pump that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:18:56">0:18:56-0:19:03</a>:</strong>  runs on solar power or you could put in a plant which is already solar powered and requires<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:03">0:19:03-0:19:07</a>:</strong>  no maintenance except for that it has a life cycle that you need to attend to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:07">0:19:07-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:15</a>:</strong>  And two colleagues, Van Clothier and Bill Ziedike, colleagues and mentors outside Silver<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:15">0:19:15-0:19:17</a>:</strong>  City, New Mexico on a ranch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:17">0:19:17-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  They took a degraded rangeland in Cienega that had eroded away and with just very simple,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:34</a>:</strong>  on rock high structures, about 60 of them and working with the landowner to shift some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:34">0:19:34-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  of their land management.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  They have brought back a thriving wetlands.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:46</a>:</strong>  They've brought back perennial water and these wetlands are now growing themselves uphill,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:46">0:19:46-0:19:54</a>:</strong>  up the banks of the waterway following water that is rising with capillary action.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:19:54">0:19:54-0:20:00</a>:</strong>  And they've now gained and held so much water in this amazing living system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:00">0:20:00-0:20:04</a>:</strong>  Those rock structures they initially built, they're still there but they're all invisible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:04">0:20:04-0:20:09</a>:</strong>  now because they're all covered with accumulated soil, organic matter and vegetation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:09">0:20:09-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  So now the vegetation and that living soil is the structures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:22</a>:</strong>  They've completely taken over and that's the goal is how do we collaborate with natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:22">0:20:22-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  systems in a way that we just nudge them to take over and do far better than we could<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:29">0:20:29-0:20:30</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:30">0:20:30-0:20:36</a>:</strong>  Well, so on that note, let's focus on passive rain harvesting systems and elaborate on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:36">0:20:36-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  term that you used earlier which is to plant the rain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:43</a>:</strong>  Can you give me an idea of what it means to plant the rain and some ways that you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:43">0:20:43-0:20:44</a>:</strong>  do it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:44">0:20:44-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:47</a>:</strong>  Well, think about how you plant a seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:47">0:20:47-0:20:51</a>:</strong>  You make a little hole in the ground, put the seed in there, cover it up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:51">0:20:51-0:20:53</a>:</strong>  So we're doing the same thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:53">0:20:53-0:20:56</a>:</strong>  We're just not covering it up per se.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:20:56">0:20:56-0:21:04</a>:</strong>  So it's easiest to plant the rain in existing low spots where water is already accumulating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:04">0:21:04-0:21:09</a>:</strong>  And if you've just got bare soil there, you're lacking a sponge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:09">0:21:09-0:21:13</a>:</strong>  So you would want to add organic matter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:13">0:21:13-0:21:14</a>:</strong>  You'd want to add seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:14">0:21:14-0:21:24</a>:</strong>  You'd want to add that life of those living pumps and do so in a way that its capacity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:24">0:21:24-0:21:25</a>:</strong>  is going to grow over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:25">0:21:25-0:21:30</a>:</strong>  You're going to get more organic matter that holds on to that moisture longer into the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:30">0:21:30-0:21:36</a>:</strong>  dry seasons and it has fertility and whatnot that's going to encourage more life, more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:36">0:21:36-0:21:43</a>:</strong>  living pumps, a wider network of roots and beneficial fungi, mycelium that link into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:43">0:21:43-0:21:50</a>:</strong>  those roots and distribute that water wider and further afield.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:21:50">0:21:50-0:22:01</a>:</strong>  There's been some great studies that have shown that if you plant the rain in a basin<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:01">0:22:01-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  and are directing adjoining runoff to it, that's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:13</a>:</strong>  But you'll never reach the full capacity of the system, the full potential of the system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:13">0:22:13-0:22:16</a>:</strong>  if you don't encourage more of that life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:16">0:22:16-0:22:24</a>:</strong>  So it's key to create the habitat, not just for the vegetation, but also that beneficial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:24">0:22:24-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  fungi.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:35</a>:</strong>  Because the web-like roots of the fungi, the mycelium, can infuse with the roots of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:35">0:22:35-0:22:44</a>:</strong>  vegetation and expand the root area of that vegetation by hundreds of times, thereby dramatically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:44">0:22:44-0:22:54</a>:</strong>  increasing that life's ability to uptake and redistribute and cycle that water you've captured<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:54">0:22:54-0:22:58</a>:</strong>  in that low spot in that basin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:22:58">0:22:58-0:23:11</a>:</strong>  So the other key thing I find with this planting of the rain is it makes it much easier for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:11">0:23:11-0:23:20</a>:</strong>  life to get a foothold and to take off without my intervention once I've created that basin,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:20">0:23:20-0:23:22</a>:</strong>  that planting of the rain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:22">0:23:22-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  There's plenty of advantages if I stay connected and I help maintain the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:34</a>:</strong>  But if I design it well, it can largely maintain itself without me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:34">0:23:34-0:23:43</a>:</strong>  So in our neighborhood, we have created a lot of street side and in-street basins.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:43">0:23:43-0:23:48</a>:</strong>  When they're in the street, they're incorporated into water harvesting traffic calming features<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:48">0:23:48-0:23:53</a>:</strong>  like roundabouts and intersections that are lower than the street and we direct the street<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:53">0:23:53-0:23:56</a>:</strong>  runoff into the basin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:23:56">0:23:56-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  On the street side, we come out into the street, constricting the street with itself to slow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:08</a>:</strong>  down traffic with what we call chicanes or pullouts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:08">0:24:08-0:24:13</a>:</strong>  And they too, within the curb, are lower than the street.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:13">0:24:13-0:24:15</a>:</strong>  We direct street runoff to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:15">0:24:15-0:24:24</a>:</strong>  So in these systems, we got a grant through the city and the county to create these, get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:24">0:24:24-0:24:27</a>:</strong>  them permitted and approved through the city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:31</a>:</strong>  But there wasn't that much money for landscaping.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:31">0:24:31-0:24:35</a>:</strong>  So we planted what there's budget for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:35">0:24:35-0:24:43</a>:</strong>  But then a number of volunteers from our neighborhood forestry effort, we came in with the seed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:43">0:24:43-0:24:49</a>:</strong>  of native plants that we felt would thrive in the various microclimates of these water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:49">0:24:49-0:24:53</a>:</strong>  harvesting traffic calming structures throughout our neighborhood streets.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:24:53">0:24:53-0:25:01</a>:</strong>  And we would do this just before the rainy season started or just as the rainy season<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:01">0:25:01-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  was starting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:05</a>:</strong>  We have two rainy seasons in our area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:05">0:25:05-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  And it was great because we never had to water that seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  The passively harvested water in these earthworks, that would provide enough water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:18</a>:</strong>  And if the rains were late, no problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:18">0:25:18-0:25:21</a>:</strong>  Nothing germinates until the rains come.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:21">0:25:21-0:25:27</a>:</strong>  And then the plants came up and we never had to supplementarily irrigate because they grew<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:27">0:25:27-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  from seed to begin with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:38</a>:</strong>  So their growth rate wasn't abnormal as it would be in a pampered plant nursery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:38">0:25:38-0:25:45</a>:</strong>  So it's been a very inexpensive way to revegetate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:45">0:25:45-0:25:47</a>:</strong>  And not everything makes it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:47">0:25:47-0:25:53</a>:</strong>  So we also learn, okay, well, what species are good, what aren't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:53">0:25:53-0:25:57</a>:</strong>  And the awesome thing too is we're getting things like the coyote gourd, which grows.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:25:57">0:25:57-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  It's got a large tuberous root and spreading vine-like growth atop the ground and over<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:06</a>:</strong>  other plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:06">0:26:06-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  And it has these wonderful gourds, which we use as seed grenades.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:15</a>:</strong>  So when the gourds mature and dry out, we make a little hole in it, fill seeds of other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:15">0:26:15-0:26:16</a>:</strong>  plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:16">0:26:16-0:26:21</a>:</strong>  And then we can germinate and then we can huck them into other water harvesting traffic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:21">0:26:21-0:26:27</a>:</strong>  calming earthworks or rain gardens and stuff errupts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:27">0:26:27-0:26:31</a>:</strong>  So yeah, living grenades.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:31">0:26:31-0:26:32</a>:</strong>  Beneficial grenades.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:32">0:26:32-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:40</a>:</strong>  It's important to make that distinction, not just lobbing grenades into abandoned lots.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:40">0:26:40-0:26:45</a>:</strong>  So tell me about some of the ways that you've learned to read the landscape anywhere that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:45">0:26:45-0:26:50</a>:</strong>  you are in order to help make informed decisions about how to intervene in a positive way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:50">0:26:50-0:26:56</a>:</strong>  You talked about sort of making those basins that hold water and give it sort of the kickstart<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:26:56">0:26:56-0:27:00</a>:</strong>  that life needs to start to expand and nature to take over.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:00">0:27:00-0:27:02</a>:</strong>  But knowing where to put those is important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:02">0:27:02-0:27:09</a>:</strong>  Like you mentioned, you had identified an arroyo in that client's land that indicated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:09">0:27:09-0:27:13</a>:</strong>  that there was going to be a stream of water in the right time of year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:13">0:27:13-0:27:18</a>:</strong>  What other things do you look for to kind of give you clues as to what sort of interventions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:18">0:27:18-0:27:19</a>:</strong>  are going to be effective?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:19">0:27:19-0:27:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:20">0:27:20-0:27:25</a>:</strong>  So I'm definitely looking for the type of vegetation that's growing and where and its<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:25">0:27:25-0:27:27</a>:</strong>  health.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  So there are many species that will clue you into areas that are better watered or more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:38</a>:</strong>  drained.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:38">0:27:38-0:27:46</a>:</strong>  And so I seek those out, but both the rich spots and the poor spots.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:46">0:27:46-0:27:51</a>:</strong>  And then I just start to ask, well, why are they this way?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:27:51">0:27:51-0:28:01</a>:</strong>  And I then try and look for anomalies like where in the heavily drained areas, the drier,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:01">0:28:01-0:28:07</a>:</strong>  more dehydrated areas with poorer soils, where is there an exception?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:07">0:28:07-0:28:13</a>:</strong>  Where is there more life, greater diversity, more soil and fertility?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:13">0:28:13-0:28:16</a>:</strong>  And what enabled that change?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:16">0:28:16-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  And oftentimes it's a speed hump in the flow, a contour speed hump that's slowing the draining<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:30</a>:</strong>  pulled by gravity of water, soil, and seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:30">0:28:30-0:28:39</a>:</strong>  And it's allowing, it's instead created a net that has slowed that downward migration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:39">0:28:39-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  and enabled things to set and spread.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:56</a>:</strong>  And in best conditions, that net isn't just stable, it grows.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:28:56">0:28:56-0:29:01</a>:</strong>  And so then I try and look, well, how is it growing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:01">0:29:01-0:29:06</a>:</strong>  Is it vegetation that's growing within and on its periphery that's growing that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:06">0:29:06-0:29:14</a>:</strong>  Is it more detritus being caught and what's enabling the capture of that detritus and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:14">0:29:14-0:29:15</a>:</strong>  so on?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:15">0:29:15-0:29:23</a>:</strong>  And in the wetter areas, the more productive areas, I'm looking for anomalies there too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:23">0:29:23-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  Like, well, where is it even more rich or where is it even starting to degrade and why?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:45</a>:</strong>  And then I try and build on what I see as reasons for positive evolutions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:45">0:29:45-0:29:54</a>:</strong>  And I'm also always looking for, well, what were those acts of disturbance that started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:29:54">0:29:54-0:30:02</a>:</strong>  a downward spiral and how have those been naturally checked out in nature?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:02">0:30:02-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  And how could I mimic or be informed by those stabilizations?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:17</a>:</strong>  And it's not just me going out and looking for this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:17">0:30:17-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  I'm also always actively looking for mentors that have well-trained eyes who can help train<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:28</a>:</strong>  mine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:28">0:30:28-0:30:32</a>:</strong>  So Bill Ziedike has been phenomenal that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:32">0:30:32-0:30:34</a>:</strong>  He's definitely a water whisperer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:34">0:30:34-0:30:42</a>:</strong>  And he's got lots of free publications that you can download, a great many of those available<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:42">0:30:42-0:30:47</a>:</strong>  at the kiviracollition.org website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:47">0:30:47-0:30:54</a>:</strong>  And to be able to walk the land with him has been incredible for my learning, as it was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:30:54">0:30:54-0:31:00</a>:</strong>  with Mr. Zephaniah Piri in Zimbabwe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:00">0:31:00-0:31:09</a>:</strong>  And it's great to also create, to tap into a community of other practitioners.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:09">0:31:09-0:31:13</a>:</strong>  So yeah, there's lots of great people doing this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:13">0:31:13-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  And we're all learning and trying to further evolve our understanding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:23</a>:</strong>  And when we get out on the land together, it's great that we can say, hey, look, I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:24</a>:</strong>  seeing this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:24">0:31:24-0:31:26</a>:</strong>  What are you seeing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:26">0:31:26-0:31:30</a>:</strong>  And to bounce ideas off each other, to challenge each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:30">0:31:30-0:31:37</a>:</strong>  And even better when we have the time to even do some simple interventions of build some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:37">0:31:37-0:31:43</a>:</strong>  simple structures and design them together and strategize, well, why we're putting this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:43">0:31:43-0:31:46</a>:</strong>  rock here as opposed to there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:31:53</a>:</strong>  And what flow of water and sediment are we trying to work with in this way?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:31:53">0:31:53-0:32:00</a>:</strong>  And how might we nudge it to be an even better collaboration with those observed patterns<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:00">0:32:00-0:32:02</a>:</strong>  of water and sediment flow?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:07</a>:</strong>  Man, I'd love to be a fly on the wall when coalitions like that get together and kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:07">0:32:07-0:32:12</a>:</strong>  of expand upon everyone else's observations and knowledge and ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:12">0:32:12-0:32:16</a>:</strong>  Those are really fun to be a part of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:16">0:32:16-0:32:21</a>:</strong>  Give me an idea of the increasing importance of water stewardship in areas that are not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:21">0:32:21-0:32:22</a>:</strong>  water deficient.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:22">0:32:22-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  I know we've been using up until now mostly the case of where you are in Tucson, Arizona,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:29</a>:</strong>  which is literally a desert.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:29">0:32:29-0:32:35</a>:</strong>  And it's in a very extreme that most people don't live in, but is a fantastic laboratory<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:35">0:32:35-0:32:39</a>:</strong>  as to with these extreme conditions, figuring out what works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:46</a>:</strong>  But water scarcity is becoming an issue even in areas that get plenty of rainfall and not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:46">0:32:46-0:32:52</a>:</strong>  working with these passive solutions like you talked about is becoming more and more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:32:53</a>:</strong>  of a problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:53">0:32:53-0:32:59</a>:</strong>  Can you give me some ideas of where water wise stewardship is important for those areas?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:32:59">0:32:59-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I've had a number of readers of my books write to me and tell me what a great thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:11">0:33:11-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  the knowledge in my books were for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:22</a>:</strong>  Because while they're surrounded by water in Louisiana, in the United States, a very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:22">0:33:22-0:33:34</a>:</strong>  wet, humid climate, because of our mistreatment of the watershed and great deals of pollution,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:34">0:33:34-0:33:41</a>:</strong>  the vast majority of that water that surrounds them is not safe to use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:41">0:33:41-0:33:49</a>:</strong>  So they've been implementing a lot of these strategies, both active and passive, to capture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:33:49">0:33:49-0:34:00</a>:</strong>  cleaner roof runoff and with an active tank system, and then use living passive systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:00">0:34:00-0:34:09</a>:</strong>  to help bio-remediate and filter the contaminated water on the ground surface.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:09">0:34:09-0:34:16</a>:</strong>  And both strategies are also helping reduce downstream flooding risk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:16">0:34:16-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  So this is very common, this potential.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  And I had the chance to interact with and learn from colleagues in South Korea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:35</a>:</strong>  And Seoul, South Korea is a very wet city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:35">0:34:35-0:34:42</a>:</strong>  And innovators there are pushing for this whole idea that every building that is built<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:42">0:34:42-0:34:50</a>:</strong>  must have three water harvesting tanks within the building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:50">0:34:50-0:34:53</a>:</strong>  One for me, one for you, and one for everybody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:34:53">0:34:53-0:35:01</a>:</strong>  The idea being the one for me, well that's water I'm collecting to use however I want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:01">0:35:01-0:35:04</a>:</strong>  and or need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:04">0:35:04-0:35:11</a>:</strong>  The one for you, well that's the water I'm collecting in a tank that is meant to be flood<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:11">0:35:11-0:35:15</a>:</strong>  control so I don't flood you downstream.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:15">0:35:15-0:35:21</a>:</strong>  And the one for everybody, that third tank is to be reserved for in times of need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:21">0:35:21-0:35:32</a>:</strong>  Should there be some kind of catastrophe, be it power goes out or there's extreme drought,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:32">0:35:32-0:35:38</a>:</strong>  there's fires, what have you, there is an on-site water reserve ready for whatever is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:38">0:35:38-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  needed and it's high quality water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:51</a>:</strong>  So the thing we have to keep in mind is we are on a planet where life exists because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:51">0:35:51-0:35:53</a>:</strong>  of water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:35:53">0:35:53-0:36:01</a>:</strong>  Water is the lubrication of exchange, enabling nutrients, information, fertility, whatnot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:01">0:36:01-0:36:08</a>:</strong>  to be transferred from one life or element to another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:08">0:36:08-0:36:14</a>:</strong>  And we have a very limited amount of water on this planet, especially fresh water that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:14">0:36:14-0:36:17</a>:</strong>  not salty or whatnot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:17">0:36:17-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  Less than 3% of the water on the planet is fresh water and really only 1% of the water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  on the planet is accessible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:35</a>:</strong>  But yet this planet does not run out of water because it's got all these incredible living<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:35">0:36:35-0:36:45</a>:</strong>  systems that have evolved to further cycle, filter that water, myriad times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:45">0:36:45-0:36:52</a>:</strong>  So that life does not degrade the quality of that water, it maintains or improves it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:36:52">0:36:52-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  And we can make a limited supply of water seem far less limited the more we cycle it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:06</a>:</strong>  by mimicking or collaborating with the natural systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:06">0:37:06-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  And in wetter climates, you tend to just have far more cycling than you do in dry climates<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:19</a>:</strong>  because there's a greater abundance of that water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:19">0:37:19-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  So your vegetation in a wet climate is going to be larger and consume water at a much more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:26">0:37:26-0:37:27</a>:</strong>  rapid rate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:27">0:37:27-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  When I say consume, I should really say cycle because it's going to pump that water up through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  it and then re-release that water, transpire that water back into the atmosphere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:48</a>:</strong>  So in wet climates, you use the same strategies we do in conceptually as we do in dry climates,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:48">0:37:48-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  but you're using a wholly different plant palette.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:37:51">0:37:51-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  You're using one that is much more water, needy or adapted to your rainfall regime.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:11</a>:</strong>  And just to try and illustrate that, so when I create these rain gardens, these basins,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:11">0:38:11-0:38:17</a>:</strong>  within them I have three distinct microclimates or planting zones, rain garden planting zones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:17">0:38:17-0:38:21</a>:</strong>  And you can check out my books on my website, illustrations of this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  But on the bottom of the basin, you have what are the bottom zone plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:26">0:38:26-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  These are your most water needy, water tolerant plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:34</a>:</strong>  And then, and also your most cold tolerant because cold air will drain into this basin<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:34">0:38:34-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  and pool in the bottom of the basin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:44</a>:</strong>  Then on the terraces, the banks of your basin, midway between the bottom and the top, that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:44">0:38:44-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  where I have a little bit less water adaptive and needed plantings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:58</a>:</strong>  And then on the top, I have the most arid adapted, the least water needy, the least<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:38:58">0:38:58-0:39:01</a>:</strong>  water tolerant plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:01">0:39:01-0:39:03</a>:</strong>  So the base of the plant stays high and dry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:03">0:39:03-0:39:09</a>:</strong>  You don't have crown rot, but the roots can still access the water down in the lower zones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:09">0:39:09-0:39:17</a>:</strong>  So I created this just by seeing how different plant types grow in my area and then just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:17">0:39:17-0:39:18</a>:</strong>  mimicking that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:18">0:39:18-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  And I've created plant lists for people that haven't yet fully observed that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  So they can just go to the list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  And these are all on my website and my books on what plant goes where.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:35</a>:</strong>  And I've worked with others in other bioregions to create plant lists for those regions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:35">0:39:35-0:39:38</a>:</strong>  And that's all on the plant section of my website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:38">0:39:38-0:39:43</a>:</strong>  But when I was in Florida, it gets five times the rain that we do annually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:43">0:39:43-0:39:46</a>:</strong>  And I'm in the swamps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:46">0:39:46-0:39:55</a>:</strong>  It was amazing to see that they naturally in that ecosystem, you have those three distinct<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:55">0:39:55-0:39:56</a>:</strong>  planting zones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:39:56">0:39:56-0:40:02</a>:</strong>  So you've got the hardwood, the bulk of the hardwood trees growing at the top.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:02">0:40:02-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  And in the bottom, you've got another hardwood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:07</a>:</strong>  You've got the swamp cypress.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:07">0:40:07-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  But all these other species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:16</a>:</strong>  And then there's also a very rich terrace zone of plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:16">0:40:16-0:40:18</a>:</strong>  And I just loved it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:18">0:40:18-0:40:23</a>:</strong>  It's like, man, I can go to any climate and I can find this pattern.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:23">0:40:23-0:40:29</a>:</strong>  And I just need to tap into what plants and what life likes to live where.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:29">0:40:29-0:40:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's getting to know those patterns that really unlocks the things that you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:33">0:40:33-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  rely upon even when you're in a place that you're not terribly familiar with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  Along those lines, what are you most excited about on the forefront of water harvesting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  and management practices that perhaps is not yet widely known or practiced in what you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:53</a>:</strong>  found around in your studies?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:53">0:40:53-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  I'd say Bill Ziedike's work is some of what excites me the most right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:40:59">0:40:59-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  And outside of the real water freaks, I don't think it's that well known.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:11</a>:</strong>  And that might in part be because it is so subtle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:11">0:41:11-0:41:17</a>:</strong>  So when it's done well, you don't even see it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:17">0:41:17-0:41:24</a>:</strong>  Because the idea is not to celebrate the structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:24">0:41:24-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  The idea is to celebrate and encourage the response.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:38</a>:</strong>  And I think too often in our current societies, we're obsessed with the human built environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:38">0:41:38-0:41:43</a>:</strong>  What you can purchase, what you can obtain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:43">0:41:43-0:41:49</a>:</strong>  And in fact, in an older edition of my second book, Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:49">0:41:49-0:41:58</a>:</strong>  Beyond Volume 2, coming out of the permaculture world, I had been exposed to and was pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:41:58">0:41:58-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  enamored with what I would call more heroic but less effective systems such as gabions,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  which are these wire wrapped rock walls perpendicular to the flow of water in a drainage that create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  a wall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  And they can be effective if built and maintained properly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:34</a>:</strong>  But they create a waterfall, a sudden drop in elevation in the drainage that did not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:34">0:42:34-0:42:36</a>:</strong>  exist before they were built.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:36">0:42:36-0:42:44</a>:</strong>  And on the downstream side of that structure, you have the potential for erosion, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:44">0:42:44-0:42:47</a>:</strong>  can even undermine the entire structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:47">0:42:47-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  Because as the water pours over the wall on the downstream side, water picks up speed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:42:57</a>:</strong>  as it's falling and creates a scour hole on the downstream side, which can eat under the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:42:57">0:42:57-0:43:03</a>:</strong>  structure itself and unravel the whole structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:03">0:43:03-0:43:11</a>:</strong>  So Bill Ziedike, he tends to use much more subtle interventions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:11">0:43:11-0:43:20</a>:</strong>  So in that same place, instead of doing a high wall, he put in only one rock high structure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:20">0:43:20-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  that's many rocks wide.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  And instead of being wall shaped, it's very gradually speed hump shaped.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:39</a>:</strong>  So the structure itself is far less likely to increase the speed and the erosive capacity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:39">0:43:39-0:43:40</a>:</strong>  of the water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:40">0:43:40-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  Instead, the structure is striving to further slow and spread the flow of water at all points,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:51</a>:</strong>  not just the upstream side, but the downstream side too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:51">0:43:51-0:43:53</a>:</strong>  And you never build one of these alone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:53">0:43:53-0:43:57</a>:</strong>  You always build them in a series.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:43:57">0:43:57-0:44:06</a>:</strong>  So you're having to keep in mind the nested holes in which you're placing this structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:06">0:44:06-0:44:15</a>:</strong>  And with these one rock dams, you seed before you place the rock.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:15">0:44:15-0:44:22</a>:</strong>  Because the whole intention is to grow vegetation through the structure that will further stabilize<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:22">0:44:22-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  it and lock it in place, but will also take the place of the structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:32</a>:</strong>  Because as both the structure and the vegetation growing through it slows and spreads the flow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:32">0:44:32-0:44:36</a>:</strong>  of water, more sediment's going to drop out of the flow and accumulate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:36">0:44:36-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  It's going to hold on to moisture longer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:39">0:44:39-0:44:40</a>:</strong>  More seeds going to germinate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:40">0:44:40-0:44:42</a>:</strong>  More vegetation is going to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:42">0:44:42-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  And you're going to grow a structure, much like the wetlands I talked about earlier in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:44:54</a>:</strong>  our conversation outside Silver City, New Mexico, where Bill and Van had worked.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:44:54">0:44:54-0:45:01</a>:</strong>  And so you come back years later, and the structures are completely buried.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:01">0:45:01-0:45:03</a>:</strong>  No problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:03">0:45:03-0:45:10</a>:</strong>  What's important is they help set up the conditions where vegetation could grow, not only on top<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:10">0:45:10-0:45:16</a>:</strong>  and just in adjoining the structure, but it could continue to grow between the structures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:16">0:45:16-0:45:22</a>:</strong>  So you have continuous life that's doing a far better job of slowing, spreading, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:32</a>:</strong>  sinking the flow of water, creating this living sponge, this soil carbon sponge, this sink,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:32">0:45:32-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  this net of fertility and cycling that just keeps building on itself over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:45</a>:</strong>  So that's what really excites me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:45">0:45:45-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  And it also really fuels my awareness of and passion for the need to not just preserve,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:46:08</a>:</strong>  but learn from and help steward the sponges we already have in place, where we have springs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:08">0:46:08-0:46:14</a>:</strong>  and cienegas, wetlands, and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:14">0:46:14-0:46:21</a>:</strong>  We can't keep mining from these, extracting from them, because we need them as our living<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:21">0:46:21-0:46:28</a>:</strong>  encyclopedias, our living schools and teachers, where we can see what works and what does<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:28">0:46:28-0:46:36</a>:</strong>  not work with or without us, so that they can inform better integrated systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:36">0:46:36-0:46:41</a>:</strong>  And what I'm getting from what you're talking about, too, is that some of these new or innovative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:41">0:46:41-0:46:45</a>:</strong>  systems are actually a lot more approachable for the average person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:45">0:46:45-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  It's going to take a big team and possibly a fairly large budget to go in and put in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:46:58</a>:</strong>  a big dam structure, or whether it's a pond or other water retention feature on a large<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:58">0:46:58-0:46:59</a>:</strong>  scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:46:59">0:46:59-0:47:04</a>:</strong>  But one of these single rock dams is something that maybe two or three people could do, or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:04">0:47:04-0:47:09</a>:</strong>  one person with a little bit of patience and a bit of understanding about how that ecosystem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:09">0:47:09-0:47:12</a>:</strong>  works and how water moves through that system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:12">0:47:12-0:47:15</a>:</strong>  Oh, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:15">0:47:15-0:47:19</a>:</strong>  They're much, much easier in terms of the build-out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:19">0:47:19-0:47:29</a>:</strong>  But what is, to really be successful, you do need to spend more time observing and thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:29">0:47:29-0:47:32</a>:</strong>  about what's the right place for this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:32">0:47:32-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  Because if you're just randomly putting it in, it can actually do more harm than good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:47:45</a>:</strong>  So you need to spend more time learning the patterns that you're trying to work with,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:45">0:47:45-0:47:47</a>:</strong>  which is all very doable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:47">0:47:47-0:47:53</a>:</strong>  But sometimes people just don't have the attention span or the will to learn that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:53">0:47:53-0:47:56</a>:</strong>  And that's essential with these strategies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:47:56">0:47:56-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  I would say, though, that is just as essential with the more resource-intensive strategies,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:05">0:48:05-0:48:09</a>:</strong>  but just as much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:09">0:48:09-0:48:15</a>:</strong>  And I'd also say that with these simple one rock dams and so on, which can very easily<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:15">0:48:15-0:48:24</a>:</strong>  be built by a single person, these, at that scale of easy build, are most appropriate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:24">0:48:24-0:48:35</a>:</strong>  in the smaller waterways, the tributaries, and where you've got a much heavier flow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:35">0:48:35-0:48:40</a>:</strong>  And let's say you've got some severe erosion of a really big head cut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:40">0:48:40-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  That may require coming in with a backhoe with a bucket and thumb to move much larger<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  rock.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:48:52</a>:</strong>  You'd be using the same patterns and everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:52">0:48:52-0:48:55</a>:</strong>  It's just the scale would be moving up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:55">0:48:55-0:48:58</a>:</strong>  That's the only difference, really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:48:58">0:48:58-0:49:03</a>:</strong>  So in that case, more equipment, more resources would be needed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:03">0:49:03-0:49:10</a>:</strong>  But it's all informed by the simpler, easier work you've done in the lower flow tributaries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:10">0:49:10-0:49:19</a>:</strong>  And I find the best equipment operators are those that learned doing the handwork.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:19">0:49:19-0:49:25</a>:</strong>  Now they're just using the equipment as an extension of their hands and arms that tends<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:25">0:49:25-0:49:28</a>:</strong>  to have bigger hydraulic biceps than their own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:28">0:49:28-0:49:31</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I seem to see that pattern reflected in a lot of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:31">0:49:31-0:49:35</a>:</strong>  By doing it the simple old-fashioned or manual or analog way, whatever that is, is going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:35">0:49:35-0:49:41</a>:</strong>  to make you that much more effective and nuanced in your approach when you have larger resources<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:41">0:49:41-0:49:42</a>:</strong>  and bigger equipment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:46</a>:</strong>  Just like someone who has done every step of the process makes a better manager because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:46">0:49:46-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  they understand every step below them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:50</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:49:50">0:49:50-0:50:00</a>:</strong>  And just to reiterate, too, these same simple strategies, approaches within waterways work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:00">0:50:00-0:50:01</a>:</strong>  great on roads.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:01">0:50:01-0:50:07</a>:</strong>  So in the rural setting or even in the urban setting with dirt driveways, when you've got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:07">0:50:07-0:50:14</a>:</strong>  a dirt road or dirt driveway, these tend to be the most erosive parts of the landscape<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:14">0:50:14-0:50:18</a>:</strong>  because there's no anchoring vegetation where you've got vehicles driving.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:18">0:50:18-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  So there's a number of really simple strategies that I've got in my books that redirect that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:30</a>:</strong>  work off the road into adjoining planting areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:30">0:50:30-0:50:41</a>:</strong>  And I've got some great stories of how a local ranch here really upped the capacity and yeah,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:41">0:50:41-0:50:48</a>:</strong>  the growth in the pastures and the feed for their livestock and wildlife by literally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:48">0:50:48-0:50:57</a>:</strong>  harvesting the rainwater off the dirt roads and spreading it out in adjoining pasture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:50:57">0:50:57-0:51:01</a>:</strong>  Which sounds like a no-brainer and it should be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:06</a>:</strong>  But what's key is to strategize where you release the water into the pasture so you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:06">0:51:06-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  choosing the least steep area where the natural landform is most likely to spread the water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:14</a>:</strong>  out for you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:14">0:51:14-0:51:19</a>:</strong>  Bill Ziedyke says there's a couple of simple principles he uses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:19">0:51:19-0:51:23</a>:</strong>  You want to drain a road your first chance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:23">0:51:23-0:51:26</a>:</strong>  So immediately start draining water off the road because water doesn't do any good on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:26">0:51:26-0:51:28</a>:</strong>  a road.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:28">0:51:28-0:51:33</a>:</strong>  The next principle is you want to use your best chance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:33">0:51:33-0:51:35</a>:</strong>  So that's stepping up the game.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:35">0:51:35-0:51:40</a>:</strong>  Instead of just draining the road, you're trying to drain the road to where the drained<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:40">0:51:40-0:51:42</a>:</strong>  water is going to serve the most good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:42">0:51:42-0:51:46</a>:</strong>  Where is it going to slow down and spread out the most to grow more life adjoining that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:46">0:51:46-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  road as opposed to shooting it off at the supposedly easiest spot onto a steep slope<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:51:56</a>:</strong>  which is just going to create a head cut that's eventually going to erode the road.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:51:56">0:51:56-0:52:04</a>:</strong>  Okay and then you want to make sure you divert water off the road at your last chance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:04">0:52:04-0:52:12</a>:</strong>  You know before the road enters an area where it is lower than the adjoining landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:12">0:52:12-0:52:18</a>:</strong>  So you want to drain whatever water you can off before there's no longer a chance to drain<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:18">0:52:18-0:52:19</a>:</strong>  that water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:19">0:52:19-0:52:24</a>:</strong>  You know it's all just simple stuff but I carry these principles in my head like a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:24">0:52:24-0:52:25</a>:</strong>  mantra reminder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:25">0:52:25-0:52:30</a>:</strong>  Because I do my other water harvesting principles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:30">0:52:30-0:52:36</a>:</strong>  The eight basic principles and then in the latest editions of my books, especially volume<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:36">0:52:36-0:52:45</a>:</strong>  two, I've created a whole number of principles for water harvesting structures within waterways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:45">0:52:45-0:52:48</a>:</strong>  And they're all just like reminders of, hey did you think of this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:52</a>:</strong>  Hey don't forget this important point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:52">0:52:52-0:52:58</a>:</strong>  And so I don't forget what should be obvious but is forgotten.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:52:58">0:52:58-0:53:02</a>:</strong>  So I'm more likely to succeed and less likely to fail.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:02">0:53:02-0:53:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah that's such a good principle and I know you're using the example of harvesting water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:06">0:53:06-0:53:12</a>:</strong>  off of a road in a rural area but your examples of doing so in urban areas, especially for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:12">0:53:12-0:53:16</a>:</strong>  people who live in a dry land context like yours and think that they don't have enough<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:16">0:53:16-0:53:22</a>:</strong>  of a catchment area to be able to gather enough water to make any meaningful difference is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:22">0:53:22-0:53:27</a>:</strong>  that you said that if you can tap into the runoff from roads especially or any other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:27">0:53:27-0:53:33</a>:</strong>  paved over structure that's not infiltrating, you can expand the area from which you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:33">0:53:33-0:53:36</a>:</strong>  harvesting from by like 10 times or more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:36">0:53:36-0:53:41</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah and you can increase the available rainfall by 10 times or more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:41">0:53:41-0:53:58</a>:</strong>  So I've had the chance to go to even drier areas like Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:53:58">0:53:58-0:54:05</a>:</strong>  So there they only get two and a half inches of rain a year and yet there is a rich history<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:05">0:54:05-0:54:13</a>:</strong>  of water harvesting throughout the region because before the time, the recent time of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:13">0:54:13-0:54:22</a>:</strong>  mechanical pumps, people were entirely reliant upon harvested rainwater in these dry climates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:22">0:54:22-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  So they made the most of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:27</a>:</strong>  They made the most of every drop that fell.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:27">0:54:27-0:54:32</a>:</strong>  So the drier your climate, the more important it is to harvest water and on the reverse<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:32">0:54:32-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  I could say the wetter your climate, the more important it is to harvest water and cycle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:45</a>:</strong>  it because water harvesting as I advocate it buffers all extremes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:45">0:54:45-0:54:47</a>:</strong>  It buffers the droughts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:47">0:54:47-0:54:49</a>:</strong>  It reduces the time of drought.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:49">0:54:49-0:54:50</a>:</strong>  It buffers floods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:50">0:54:50-0:54:57</a>:</strong>  It reduces the time and the severity of drought of flooding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:57">0:54:57-0:54:59</a>:</strong>  So all that is key.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:54:59">0:54:59-0:55:05</a>:</strong>  And here in my dry community of Tucson and this being the summer being a record year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:05">0:55:05-0:55:12</a>:</strong>  of drought and heat, we only got one good rain this summer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:12">0:55:12-0:55:15</a>:</strong>  We usually get at least a dozen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:15">0:55:15-0:55:17</a>:</strong>  We only got one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:17">0:55:17-0:55:25</a>:</strong>  And when I say good rain, I mean that there's enough rain that we get a good amount of runoff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:25">0:55:25-0:55:27</a>:</strong>  So we only had one of those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:27">0:55:27-0:55:36</a>:</strong>  Nonetheless, where people, myself and some neighbors included, set up water harvesting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:36">0:55:36-0:55:47</a>:</strong>  earthworks to capture the runoff off the street and other surfaces, those filled in that one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:47">0:55:47-0:55:49</a>:</strong>  rain event.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:49">0:55:49-0:55:57</a>:</strong>  Whereas neighbors that were not doing any harvest of water, everything rapidly drained<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:57">0:55:57-0:55:59</a>:</strong>  away and evaporated out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:55:59">0:55:59-0:56:04</a>:</strong>  And their plants still look desiccated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:04">0:56:04-0:56:12</a>:</strong>  Whereas those of us who created these water harvesting structures and captured the rain<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:12">0:56:12-0:56:18</a>:</strong>  the one time it fell this summer, everything's looking great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:18">0:56:18-0:56:22</a>:</strong>  Now of course, you could also go to a neighbor who's not doing any water harvesting but is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:22">0:56:22-0:56:25</a>:</strong>  pumping city water and irrigating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:25">0:56:25-0:56:28</a>:</strong>  Well that doesn't, I don't look at those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:28">0:56:28-0:56:31</a>:</strong>  That's not a natural system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:31">0:56:31-0:56:34</a>:</strong>  That's not informing me of anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:34">0:56:34-0:56:42</a>:</strong>  But looking at the comparing the systems where folks are not bringing in any outside water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:42">0:56:42-0:56:46</a>:</strong>  The system is just reliant upon what's there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:46">0:56:46-0:56:51</a>:</strong>  It's very dramatic to see the difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:51">0:56:51-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  And it's seeing that difference, that's what really juices me and sparks me to continue<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:56:58</a>:</strong>  this work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:56:58">0:56:58-0:57:10</a>:</strong>  Because with climate change getting worse and it's very frustrating for me to see how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:10">0:57:10-0:57:12</a>:</strong>  temporal our thinking is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:12">0:57:12-0:57:24</a>:</strong>  How we seem to respond to what seems to be the most immediate urgency and too often let<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:24">0:57:24-0:57:30</a>:</strong>  climate change resiliency, we let that go and instead are dressing with something else<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:30">0:57:30-0:57:31</a>:</strong>  before us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:31">0:57:31-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  Which yeah, politics, whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:36</a>:</strong>  But we should be looking at climate change in terms of politics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:36">0:57:36-0:57:40</a>:</strong>  Okay, I'm not going to go down that vent spiral.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:40">0:57:40-0:57:42</a>:</strong>  We'll do that in another episode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:42">0:57:42-0:57:51</a>:</strong>  But the key thing I want to say here, the juicing thing, the life affirming thing is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:51">0:57:51-0:57:58</a>:</strong>  it's very apparent to me to see the response to what we're doing around here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:57:58">0:57:58-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  Right now with work that you can do in a matter of hours, you can have a big effect on buffering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:10</a>:</strong>  our climate extremes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:10">0:58:10-0:58:18</a>:</strong>  So with the very simple work we did with hand tools and neighbors, we have oasis spots that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:18">0:58:18-0:58:23</a>:</strong>  are still hydrated, they're shaded, they're much cooler, they have greater density of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:23">0:58:23-0:58:29</a>:</strong>  wildlife habitat and we're producing wild native foods where we're harvesting the water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:29">0:58:29-0:58:33</a>:</strong>  and the soil has got more organic matter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:33">0:58:33-0:58:40</a>:</strong>  The soil profile is deeper, it's richer, there's far more life within it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:40">0:58:40-0:58:46</a>:</strong>  And when you compare to the drained areas, which are desiccated and they're hotter and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:46">0:58:46-0:58:48</a>:</strong>  they're unraveling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:48">0:58:48-0:58:55</a>:</strong>  So there's so much we can do so easily.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:58:55">0:58:55-0:59:02</a>:</strong>  And the great thing is you don't have to leave home to see examples of this if you know how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:02">0:59:02-0:59:03</a>:</strong>  to look.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:03">0:59:03-0:59:10</a>:</strong>  And on those wonderful worlds of inspiration, Brad, could you tell us where people can find<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:10">0:59:10-0:59:16</a>:</strong>  the resources that you have at the harvestingrainwater.com, the two books that you have in new editions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:16">0:59:16-0:59:21</a>:</strong>  and some of the other projects that you're working on where they can find some examples<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:21">0:59:21-0:59:22</a>:</strong>  of what you're talking about?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:22">0:59:22-0:59:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:23">0:59:23-0:59:28</a>:</strong>  So, well, I just mentioned at the end there that if you just know how to look, that is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:28">0:59:28-0:59:35</a>:</strong>  a major focus of my books, my teaching, my workshops is enabling us to see in new ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:35">0:59:35-0:59:38</a>:</strong>  and then to act upon that scene.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:38">0:59:38-0:59:47</a>:</strong>  So you can get my books at my website harvestingrainwater.com and you can get it anywhere books are sold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:47">0:59:47-0:59:53</a>:</strong>  But it's especially great for me and the whole effort if you can buy direct from me because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:53">0:59:53-0:59:57</a>:</strong>  that way there's no middle person taking a cut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=0:59:57">0:59:57-1:00:04</a>:</strong>  And I'm able to direct more resources to the generation of more books, more free resources<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:04">1:00:04-1:00:06</a>:</strong>  I put up on my website and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:06">1:00:06-1:00:09</a>:</strong>  So again harvestingrainwater.com is the place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:09">1:00:09-1:00:16</a>:</strong>  The title of the books are Rainwater Harvesting for Drylands and Beyond Volumes 1 and 2.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:16">1:00:16-1:00:23</a>:</strong>  And I recently came out with brand new expanded revised full color editions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:23">1:00:23-1:00:30</a>:</strong>  So I highly recommend you get those as opposed to the old editions because I've made a dramatic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:30">1:00:30-1:00:32</a>:</strong>  amount of significant changes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:32">1:00:32-1:00:39</a>:</strong>  I've removed strategies I no longer can stand behind and have brought in a lot more, for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:39">1:00:39-1:00:46</a>:</strong>  example, the ZDyke inspired strategies that I find are exemplary.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:46">1:00:46-1:00:52</a>:</strong>  And there's plenty of free resources on my website, including plant lists for different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:00:52">1:00:52-1:01:00</a>:</strong>  bioregions, lots of image galleries and videos for rainwater rooftop systems, street runoff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:00">1:01:00-1:01:07</a>:</strong>  harvesting, greywater harvesting systems, air conditioning condensate harvesting, systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:07">1:01:07-1:01:11</a>:</strong>  on fertility like compost toilet systems and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:11">1:01:11-1:01:15</a>:</strong>  And so check all those out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:15">1:01:15-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  And a new, well it's not a new effort.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:18">1:01:18-1:01:27</a>:</strong>  It's just a new branding of a long time effort, is check out my neighborhood forestry work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:27">1:01:27-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  So if you go to DunbarSpringNeighborhoodForrestors.org, again DunbarSpringNeighborhoodForrestors.org,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:37">1:01:37-1:01:44</a>:</strong>  that's the website for the neighborhood forestry effort that I'm doing within my neighborhood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:44">1:01:44-1:01:51</a>:</strong>  But we've set up the website and all the templates and the tools so that any neighborhood anywhere<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:51">1:01:51-1:01:55</a>:</strong>  can use them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:55">1:01:55-1:01:56</a>:</strong>  So yeah, check that out as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:01:56">1:01:56-1:02:05</a>:</strong>  And another effort where we've got a great cookbook on Sonoran Desert, wild foods, how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:05">1:02:05-1:02:10</a>:</strong>  you can grow them, steward them, harvest them, process them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:10">1:02:10-1:02:12</a>:</strong>  The cookbook being Eat Mosquitoes More.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:12">1:02:12-1:02:15</a>:</strong>  It's available at DesertHarvesters.org.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:15">1:02:15-1:02:20</a>:</strong>  And even if you're from another bioregion, again, that can be a great template for your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:20">1:02:20-1:02:26</a>:</strong>  region because you can open up the book to any month of the year and see, oh, well, what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:26">1:02:26-1:02:33</a>:</strong>  harvestable or plantable at this time of the year and gives you all the steps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:33">1:02:33-1:02:40</a>:</strong>  And yeah, there's plenty more, but that's the main stuff on the table right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:40">1:02:40-1:02:41</a>:</strong>  And oh, I'll just mention too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:41">1:02:41-1:02:43</a>:</strong>  I'm also really into live storytelling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:43">1:02:43-1:02:46</a>:</strong>  That's all been put on hold with COVID at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:46">1:02:46-1:02:52</a>:</strong>  But you can check out the storytelling page on my website, HarvestingRainwater.com.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:52">1:02:52-1:02:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that is a good list of resources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:02:56">1:02:56-1:03:01</a>:</strong>  I've checked out the storytelling event that you guys do, and it's really engaging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:01">1:03:01-1:03:06</a>:</strong>  It's kind of along the lines of The Moth or other people who listen to podcasts like that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:06">1:03:06-1:03:08</a>:</strong>  and enjoy live storytelling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:08">1:03:08-1:03:10</a>:</strong>  It's a really good resource.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:10">1:03:10-1:03:13</a>:</strong>  I'll be sure to put all the links for this on the show notes for this episode on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:13">1:03:13-1:03:15</a>:</strong>  website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:15">1:03:15-1:03:17</a>:</strong>  And Brad, it's been a real pleasure to talk to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:17">1:03:17-1:03:21</a>:</strong>  I've gotten so much out of the body of work that you've published online and the educational<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:21">1:03:21-1:03:27</a>:</strong>  resources that you've put out there have helped me a ton in giving solid advice and direction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:27">1:03:27-1:03:32</a>:</strong>  to my clients, as well as informing the projects that I've done around the world as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:32">1:03:32-1:03:34</a>:</strong>  So I really want to thank you for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:34">1:03:34-1:03:40</a>:</strong>  And I look forward to continuing to follow your work and hopefully doing another episode<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:40">1:03:40-1:03:42</a>:</strong>  like this in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:42">1:03:42-1:03:43</a>:</strong>  That'd be great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:43">1:03:43-1:03:44</a>:</strong>  I'd love it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:44">1:03:44-1:03:46</a>:</strong>  And again, thanks for the opportunity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:46">1:03:46-1:03:50</a>:</strong>  And I just remembered a couple of the things I want to share with you all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:50">1:03:50-1:03:51</a>:</strong>  By all means.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:51">1:03:51-1:03:52</a>:</strong>  That I'm working on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:03:52">1:03:52-1:04:02</a>:</strong>  So because international shipping is crazy expensive, for some the books can seem not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:02">1:04:02-1:04:04</a>:</strong>  so accessible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:04">1:04:04-1:04:09</a>:</strong>  That's why I've now got an ebook edition of my first book, Rainwater Harvesting for Dry<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:09">1:04:09-1:04:10</a>:</strong>  Lands and Beyond.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:10">1:04:10-1:04:13</a>:</strong>  So there's no shipping cost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:13">1:04:13-1:04:17</a>:</strong>  And the awesome thing about it is you can have it on your phone at any time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:17">1:04:17-1:04:20</a>:</strong>  And I found it great for using with clients and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:20">1:04:20-1:04:25</a>:</strong>  I can pull up imagery of what I'm talking about at any point, show them a case study,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:25">1:04:25-1:04:29</a>:</strong>  show them a calculation so we can figure out how much water they'll harvest and how many<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:29">1:04:29-1:04:33</a>:</strong>  plants that'll support.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:33">1:04:33-1:04:37</a>:</strong>  And I am currently working on an ebook edition of Volume 2.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:37">1:04:37-1:04:40</a>:</strong>  I hope to have that out in November.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:40">1:04:40-1:04:42</a>:</strong>  Check the website for updates on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:42">1:04:42-1:04:47</a>:</strong>  And also I'm currently working on a Spanish edition of my first book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:47">1:04:47-1:04:52</a>:</strong>  So we're halfway through the translation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:52">1:04:52-1:04:57</a>:</strong>  We hope to have the translation wrapped up by the end of 2020.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:04:57">1:04:57-1:05:02</a>:</strong>  And we'll release that in digital ebook form.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:02">1:05:02-1:05:04</a>:</strong>  Really early in the new year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:04">1:05:04-1:05:05</a>:</strong>  Oh, excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:05">1:05:05-1:05:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I can't wait for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:07">1:05:07-1:05:11</a>:</strong>  I've been looking for a Spanish resource like that to bring over to Spain here with some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:11">1:05:11-1:05:15</a>:</strong>  of my work and some of the courses that I'm hoping to launch in the upcoming year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:15">1:05:15-1:05:18</a>:</strong>  So definitely keep me informed when that one comes out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/brad-lancaster/#t=1:05:18">1:05:18-1:05:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah, you bet.<br />
