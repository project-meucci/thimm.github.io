<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:08</a>:</strong>  audio, I've included a lot of links to the images on the online forums that you can find<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:08">0:04:08-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  in the show notes for this episode to make it easier to follow along.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:12">0:04:12-0:04:17</a>:</strong>  This was a really fun conversation, but I'll warn you listeners that the nerd factor, much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:17">0:04:17-0:04:22</a>:</strong>  like when I get talking about earthen plasters and design theory, is really high on this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:22">0:04:22-0:04:23</a>:</strong>  one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:23">0:04:23-0:04:28</a>:</strong>  So get your pocket protectors and thick glasses out and I'll turn things over now to Donkey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:28">0:04:28-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  Hey, Kirk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:31</a>:</strong>  Donkey, my man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:31">0:04:31-0:04:32</a>:</strong>  How are you doing, buddy?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:32">0:04:32-0:04:33</a>:</strong>  I'm great, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:33">0:04:33-0:04:35</a>:</strong>  Long time, no talk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:35">0:04:35-0:04:37</a>:</strong>  I know, far too long.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:37">0:04:37-0:04:38</a>:</strong>  It's really cool to catch up with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:38">0:04:38-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  I'm glad to hear things are going so well at your place up in Northern California and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:48</a>:</strong>  that you've got so much work doing small cobb cottages and ovens and rocket stoves and all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:48">0:04:48-0:04:50</a>:</strong>  that fun stuff that you're known for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:50">0:04:50-0:04:51</a>:</strong>  Thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:51">0:04:51-0:04:57</a>:</strong>  Well, so I really am hoping to get kind of a more updated version of the conversation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:04:57">0:04:57-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  that we had previously, kind of going into depth about rocket stoves, where that technology<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:02">0:05:02-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  is at, but we're also going to explore a little bit more about the options that people have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:11</a>:</strong>  for these types of installations in their home and also how to compare them to different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:11">0:05:11-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  types of stoves and fuel sources and all that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:16</a>:</strong>  So what do you say we just jump right in?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:16">0:05:16-0:05:17</a>:</strong>  All righty then.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:17">0:05:17-0:05:18</a>:</strong>  Excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:18">0:05:18-0:05:21</a>:</strong>  So like I mentioned, we recorded an episode earlier before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:21">0:05:21-0:05:25</a>:</strong>  So if anybody wants to get to know about your background and how you got into natural building,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:25">0:05:25-0:05:29</a>:</strong>  I'm going to leave a link to that episode in the show notes for this podcast so they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:29">0:05:29-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  can go and check that out and we'll jump ahead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:37</a>:</strong>  So let's start by talking about some of the innovations in rocket stove technology and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:37">0:05:37-0:05:43</a>:</strong>  what have been some of the changes that you've seen in the last couple of years?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:43">0:05:43-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  Oh boy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:52</a>:</strong>  Well, you know, the batch rocket, the batch box rocket stove is really coming into its<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:52">0:05:52-0:05:53</a>:</strong>  own now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:53">0:05:53-0:05:56</a>:</strong>  Talk a little bit about that from the basics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:05:56">0:05:56-0:06:00</a>:</strong>  For anybody who hasn't heard that term or know exactly what you're referring to, can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:00">0:06:00-0:06:01</a>:</strong>  you kind of describe it for us?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:01">0:06:01-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  Sure, sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:07</a>:</strong>  You know how most of the rocket stoves that we're usually familiar with, you see a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:07">0:06:07-0:06:12</a>:</strong>  of, I mean, well, there's really now three major branches of rocket stove and it's all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:12">0:06:12-0:06:15</a>:</strong>  about the feed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:15">0:06:15-0:06:16</a>:</strong>  There's the horizontal feed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:16">0:06:16-0:06:21</a>:</strong>  That's the oldest one that you see on cook stoves where you feed horizontally into the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:21">0:06:21-0:06:27</a>:</strong>  stove and the feed is the same diameter all the way through the feed and the heat riser<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:27">0:06:27-0:06:29</a>:</strong>  and all that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:29">0:06:29-0:06:35</a>:</strong>  That's the old Winnie Arsky rocket stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:35">0:06:35-0:06:40</a>:</strong>  And then you have the J tube rocket stove, which is moving into the rocket mass heaters<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:40">0:06:40-0:06:48</a>:</strong>  realm where you put the wood down in it and then it burns horizontally, you know, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:48">0:06:48-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  then before it goes to the heat riser.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  And again, that rocket stove, it's the same diameter all the way through, you know, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:01</a>:</strong>  feed is the same diameter as the little horizontal burn tunnel part is the same diameter as the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:01">0:07:01-0:07:06</a>:</strong>  heat riser is the same diameter as the chimney pipe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:06">0:07:06-0:07:12</a>:</strong>  And then you have about the batch rocket, which is completely different in a way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:12">0:07:12-0:07:20</a>:</strong>  It's sort of a return to the horizontal feed, but with a much larger firebox.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:20">0:07:20-0:07:27</a>:</strong>  It's like a real firebox where you can put in much more wood at a time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:27">0:07:27-0:07:38</a>:</strong>  So batch rocket is about four times the diameter of the chimney and the heat riser.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:38">0:07:38-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  What are some of the advantages of those different configurations?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  What have you found either makes it easier to run or like, yeah, how does that shake<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:50</a>:</strong>  Well, let's see.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:50">0:07:50-0:07:58</a>:</strong>  The old horizontal ones were really meant for cooking and they were designed to be operated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:07:58">0:07:58-0:08:01</a>:</strong>  in places where there wasn't a lot of firewood available.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:01">0:08:01-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  And so you needed to be very, very, very conservative with the wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:11</a>:</strong>  So you have to physically push the wood into the fire consistently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:11">0:08:11-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  You have to be there and alert and awake and constantly feeding in the wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:22</a>:</strong>  And if you don't do that, then it'll go kind of go out on its own, which means that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:22">0:08:22-0:08:23</a>:</strong>  save on your stick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:23">0:08:23-0:08:24</a>:</strong>  Right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:24">0:08:24-0:08:25</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:25">0:08:25-0:08:26</a>:</strong>  It's efficient for fuel in that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:26">0:08:26-0:08:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:27">0:08:27-0:08:31</a>:</strong>  Well, it's efficient for fuel, but it's also, I mean, you know, all these stoves are really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:31">0:08:31-0:08:33</a>:</strong>  efficient for fuel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:33">0:08:33-0:08:39</a>:</strong>  And I think that the J tube is actually a more consistent, efficient burn than the L<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:39">0:08:39-0:08:40</a>:</strong>  tube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:40">0:08:40-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  We'll call the L tube the horizontal feed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:50</a>:</strong>  It's just that the L tube horizontal feed, if you don't shove the wood in on purpose,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:50">0:08:50-0:08:51</a>:</strong>  it will not burn it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:51">0:08:51-0:08:56</a>:</strong>  It'll sort of just kind of go out where with the J tube, if you walk away from it, if you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:08:56">0:08:56-0:09:02</a>:</strong>  leave it alone, the wood will feed itself down until it's gone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:02">0:09:02-0:09:06</a>:</strong>  For the most part is assuming it doesn't get blocked or kind of jammed in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:06">0:09:06-0:09:07</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:07">0:09:07-0:09:08</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:08">0:09:08-0:09:09</a>:</strong>  Assuming it doesn't block or jam up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:09">0:09:09-0:09:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:10">0:09:10-0:09:12</a>:</strong>  Which happens, you know, nature does its thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:12">0:09:12-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  Definitely in my experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:15</a>:</strong>  And I've always preferred the J tube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:15">0:09:15-0:09:20</a>:</strong>  That's kind of what I've taught in my own courses because like a minimal amount of maintenance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:20">0:09:20-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  means you can be paying more attention to either what you're cooking up on top or, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:27</a>:</strong>  know, just not have to watch it so much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:27">0:09:27-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:29">0:09:29-0:09:31</a>:</strong>  Well, you know, the J tube has to be taller.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:31">0:09:31-0:09:37</a>:</strong>  Like it has to have a taller heat riser, which means that it's better geared for people who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:37">0:09:37-0:09:42</a>:</strong>  stand at the fire, who stands to cook.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:42">0:09:42-0:09:47</a>:</strong>  Well, it's that's not culturally culturally appropriate in a lot of places in the world<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:47">0:09:47-0:09:50</a>:</strong>  where the people squat or sit to cook.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:50">0:09:50-0:09:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:51">0:09:51-0:09:58</a>:</strong>  I mean, one of the challenges I ran into is in the small indigenous village in Guatemala<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:09:58">0:09:58-0:10:04</a>:</strong>  that I was living in, a lot of the women who primarily did the cooking in the house were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:04">0:10:04-0:10:07</a>:</strong>  under five feet tall, not uncommonly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:07">0:10:07-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  And to have that higher heat riser made it somewhat uncomfortable for them to use a stove<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:12</a>:</strong>  at that height.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:12">0:10:12-0:10:18</a>:</strong>  And I was constantly trying to put the, the J portion, the burn chamber down deeper into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:18">0:10:18-0:10:24</a>:</strong>  the earth, which, you know, has some advantages, but goodness, if, if any moisture rises up,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:24">0:10:24-0:10:26</a>:</strong>  it could flood at the bottom.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:26">0:10:26-0:10:27</a>:</strong>  That's yeah, that's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:27">0:10:27-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:32</a>:</strong>  But, you know, I mean, the proportions can be messed with a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:32">0:10:32-0:10:36</a>:</strong>  I know that there's an ideal proportion, but there's a little bit of wiggle room.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:36">0:10:36-0:10:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:37">0:10:37-0:10:39</a>:</strong>  I often ended up shortening it a little bit for convenience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:39">0:10:39-0:10:40</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:40">0:10:40-0:10:41</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:41">0:10:41-0:10:45</a>:</strong>  So, I mean, so, so one of the other things about the L tube is, is that, that features<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:45">0:10:45-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  that you can sit or squat at the fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  And it's culturally appropriate for, for people who do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:53</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:53">0:10:53-0:10:56</a>:</strong>  Whereas the J tube is very difficult as you pointed out, it's difficult for some short<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:56">0:10:56-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  people to deal with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:03</a>:</strong>  You know, let alone sit or squat at the fire to deal with, you know, to, to, to work with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:03">0:11:03-0:11:04</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:04">0:11:04-0:11:05</a>:</strong>  Mm hmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:05">0:11:05-0:11:08</a>:</strong>  So that's that, that's more of a cultural thing I think.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:08">0:11:08-0:11:11</a>:</strong>  Um, and a way of saving on wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:11">0:11:11-0:11:16</a>:</strong>  I mean, you know, granted you could pull the firewood out of a J tube to save it if you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:17</a>:</strong>  want to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:17">0:11:17-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  But, but again, you know, you have to be conscious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:21">0:11:21-0:11:23</a>:</strong>  So I got a little more maintenance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:23">0:11:23-0:11:25</a>:</strong>  It's a bit more of an involved process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:25">0:11:25-0:11:26</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:26">0:11:26-0:11:27</a>:</strong>  Well, I don't know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:27">0:11:27-0:11:29</a>:</strong>  Both of them are, you have to be conscious with both of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:29">0:11:29-0:11:32</a>:</strong>  You have to be conscious pushing the wood into the one and you have to be conscious<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:32">0:11:32-0:11:34</a>:</strong>  taking the wood out of the other one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:34">0:11:34-0:11:37</a>:</strong>  And I guess it's all relative to, it depends on what you're comparing it to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:37">0:11:37-0:11:41</a>:</strong>  So if it's like an open fire that you're used to tending a lot, it's not that big of a difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  But if you're used to just pressing a knob and throttling a gas flame or even just, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:53</a>:</strong>  know, like a resistor and electrical resistor, all right, then it's a different comparison.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:53">0:11:53-0:11:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah, true enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:54">0:11:54-0:11:55</a>:</strong>  True enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:11:56</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:11:56">0:11:56-0:12:01</a>:</strong>  So moving along, we got the, the, the J tube now, which we've kind of talked about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:01">0:12:01-0:12:07</a>:</strong>  J tubes are nice in that you can stand at them and feed down, you know, because, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:07">0:12:07-0:12:10</a>:</strong>  I come from a culture that stands to cook.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:10">0:12:10-0:12:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:11">0:12:11-0:12:18</a>:</strong>  Um, if I, I, you know, I've built, um, stand up stoves that use the, the L tube feed and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:18">0:12:18-0:12:22</a>:</strong>  it's quite a pain actually because you're, you have to constantly get down on your hands<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:22">0:12:22-0:12:26</a>:</strong>  and knees to look horizontally to stuff wood into the box.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:26">0:12:26-0:12:27</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:27">0:12:27-0:12:31</a>:</strong>  So you're up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, you know, and it's, it's not that great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:31">0:12:31-0:12:38</a>:</strong>  So standing at a J tube, um, rocket mass heater, I mean, sorry, rocket cooker is much easier<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:38">0:12:38-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  because you can basically just reach down and twiddle the wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  It's not a horizontal, you know, it's not a horizontal twiddle box.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:48</a>:</strong>  It's a vertical one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:48">0:12:48-0:12:49</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:49">0:12:49-0:12:56</a>:</strong>  Um, the vertical feed also tends to hold the wood in a better position for combustion all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:12:56">0:12:56-0:13:00</a>:</strong>  the time, you know, because it's falling down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:00">0:13:00-0:13:05</a>:</strong>  Ideally it's falling down to the bottom of the firebox where the combustion's happening<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:05">0:13:05-0:13:08</a>:</strong>  and ideally it tends to sort of do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:08">0:13:08-0:13:09</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:09">0:13:09-0:13:17</a>:</strong>  I mean, of course it doesn't always, you know, a little bit of fluff or branches sticking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:17">0:13:17-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  out or just the friction inside the box.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:25</a>:</strong>  They'll, they'll hang up if you're not paying attention and then the bottom of the sticks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:25">0:13:25-0:13:31</a>:</strong>  will burn off and then the top of the stick now on fire will roll out of the firebox.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:31">0:13:31-0:13:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah, potentially.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:33">0:13:33-0:13:38</a>:</strong>  Or, um, depending on the draw to, in my experience, the fire might start coming up some of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:38">0:13:38-0:13:43</a>:</strong>  longer sticks and reverse the flow or start burning outside of the chamber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:43">0:13:43-0:13:45</a>:</strong>  It was supposed to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:45">0:13:45-0:13:49</a>:</strong>  And then I guess the other one that I, every once in a while would struggle with is depending<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:49">0:13:49-0:13:55</a>:</strong>  on how those sticks would fall as the bottom's burned out, it could choke off the fire by<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:55">0:13:55-0:13:56</a>:</strong>  blocking the air intake.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:56">0:13:56-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  Yup.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:01</a>:</strong>  Uh, there's a little thing called a Peter channel, a P channel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:01">0:14:01-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  Uh, it's a metal plate that you can build that goes against the front brick or the back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:09</a>:</strong>  brick, I guess the brick away from you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:09">0:14:09-0:14:10</a>:</strong>  Agreed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:10">0:14:10-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:12</a>:</strong>  Those can be super useful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:12">0:14:12-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  And there's like that variation on the L configuration too, that keeps the airflow underneath going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:17</a>:</strong>  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:17">0:14:17-0:14:18</a>:</strong>  Yup.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:18">0:14:18-0:14:19</a>:</strong>  That's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:19">0:14:19-0:14:20</a>:</strong>  Yup.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:20">0:14:20-0:14:21</a>:</strong>  Those are super useful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:21">0:14:21-0:14:24</a>:</strong>  I would recommend if anybody's building those configurations to, to make the little extra<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:24">0:14:24-0:14:26</a>:</strong>  effort and put that metal thing in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:26">0:14:26-0:14:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:27">0:14:27-0:14:31</a>:</strong>  Well that, I mean the metal thing avoids, um, it's, it's great for three things really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:31">0:14:31-0:14:32</a>:</strong>  I choke.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:32">0:14:32-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:34</a>:</strong>  Did we talk about this in the last go?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:34">0:14:34-0:14:35</a>:</strong>  I don't think we covered the P channel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:35">0:14:35-0:14:36</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:36">0:14:36-0:14:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:37">0:14:37-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  I don't really remember that we did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  Um, it's worth mentioning though.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:40">0:14:40-0:14:41</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:41">0:14:41-0:14:48</a>:</strong>  Well it's just a little metal plate and it's, um, it's about 5% of the, of the cross sectional<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:48">0:14:48-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  area of the whole system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:14:54</a>:</strong>  Um, and what it does is it creates, well actually no, let me rephrase that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:54">0:14:54-0:14:59</a>:</strong>  It creates an air channel that's 5% of the cross sectional area of the rest of the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:14:59">0:14:59-0:15:00</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:00">0:15:00-0:15:07</a>:</strong>  Um, and a fresh air that then can be sort of injected in front downstream from where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:07">0:15:07-0:15:08</a>:</strong>  the wood is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:08">0:15:08-0:15:09</a>:</strong>  Yup.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:09">0:15:09-0:15:14</a>:</strong>  Uh, and it keeps that first brick really much cooler so it's less likely to crack.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:14">0:15:14-0:15:20</a>:</strong>  Um, and it sort of prevents the, what you were talking about, wood from falling into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:20">0:15:20-0:15:24</a>:</strong>  that space and just completely choking with fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:24">0:15:24-0:15:32</a>:</strong>  Um, and it also creates a consistent steady stream of cool air, uh, and just downstream<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:32">0:15:32-0:15:34</a>:</strong>  where you want it really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:34">0:15:34-0:15:35</a>:</strong>  Mm hmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:35">0:15:35-0:15:41</a>:</strong>  Um, so it's, it's really good for organizing the fire and it goes hand in hand with another<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:41">0:15:41-0:15:43</a>:</strong>  thing called a trip wire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:43">0:15:43-0:15:47</a>:</strong>  Now this one I have been reading about, I've seen all the pictures and the instructions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:47">0:15:47-0:15:51</a>:</strong>  on the forums that you host, but I haven't had a chance to try it out myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:51">0:15:51-0:15:53</a>:</strong>  Can you explain it a little?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:53">0:15:53-0:15:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:54">0:15:54-0:15:58</a>:</strong>  Uh, you may have experienced this with regular J tube, you know, where you put the wood in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:15:58">0:15:58-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  and it'll do something that I call seeking where the flame will run down the firebox<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:12</a>:</strong>  really far and you'll even see it sometimes pop out of the heat riser for a second and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:12">0:16:12-0:16:16</a>:</strong>  then it'll run back again and then it'll run out and run back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:16">0:16:16-0:16:19</a>:</strong>  It'll sort of pulse, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:19">0:16:19-0:16:26</a>:</strong>  You may have seen that pulsing and every time the fire does that pulsing maneuver, when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:30</a>:</strong>  it returns, it'll puff a little puff of smoke.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:30">0:16:30-0:16:35</a>:</strong>  So if you were to check its efficiency curve while it's pulsing, you'll see high efficiency<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:35">0:16:35-0:16:39</a>:</strong>  and then suddenly this low efficiency moment and then back to high efficiency again and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:39">0:16:39-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  back to low efficiency, et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:43">0:16:43-0:16:51</a>:</strong>  And it's a sign that there's an airflow problem, but, um, even when the air is going fine and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:51">0:16:51-0:16:55</a>:</strong>  everything's arranged just right, you can still see that flame sort of pulse in and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:55">0:16:55-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:17:02</a>:</strong>  Um, and quite often you'll see that flame running up the heat riser, uh, and it'll be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:02">0:17:02-0:17:04</a>:</strong>  a little more disorganized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:04">0:17:04-0:17:11</a>:</strong>  So a, um, a trip wire does is it's, it can be made a lot of different ways, but typically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:11">0:17:11-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  it's a brick with sort of an arrow shape cut into it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  And the arrow shape has what we call a bluff body on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:24</a>:</strong>  Um, and this brick is placed at the very top of the horizontal burn chamber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:24">0:17:24-0:17:27</a>:</strong>  So it's down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:27">0:17:27-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  And this is closer towards the fuel source or closer towards the heat riser?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:34</a>:</strong>  It's kind of in the middle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:34">0:17:34-0:17:41</a>:</strong>  I would say, you know, uh, most of my, um, horizontal, most of my burn tunnels are about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:41">0:17:41-0:17:42</a>:</strong>  four bricks deep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:42">0:17:42-0:17:43</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:43">0:17:43-0:17:44</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:44">0:17:44-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  So I guess it's actually closer to the fuel source because it's the second brick typically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:49</a>:</strong>  Gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:49">0:17:49-0:17:50</a>:</strong>  Gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:50">0:17:50-0:17:55</a>:</strong>  And so visually looking at it, it's, it's like a slanted arrow pointing downstream of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:55">0:17:55-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  where the fire is going, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:17:58</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:58">0:17:58-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  That's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:00</a>:</strong>  And it's a slanted arrow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:00">0:18:00-0:18:01</a>:</strong>  So it makes a little bluff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:03</a>:</strong>  It's like a little projection from the ceiling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:03">0:18:03-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:09</a>:</strong>  Um, and that little projection creates turbulence.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:09">0:18:09-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  And so what that turbulence does is it mixes the fuel air better because you know, the,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:20</a>:</strong>  the unburned fuel, the hot unburned fuel tends to rise to the top of that, of that tunnel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:20">0:18:20-0:18:26</a>:</strong>  Uh, and so this, um, little heat, uh, this little, uh, trip wire will spin that stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:26">0:18:26-0:18:27</a>:</strong>  up really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:27">0:18:27-0:18:31</a>:</strong>  So you'll get a really good fuel air mixture there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:31">0:18:31-0:18:35</a>:</strong>  But what it also does is it creates sort of a flame holder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:35">0:18:35-0:18:38</a>:</strong>  Um, are you familiar with the term flame holder?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:38">0:18:38-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  No, no.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:40</a>:</strong>  Catch me up to speed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:40">0:18:40-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  Well, a lot of stoves like propane stoves, any stove that burns a gas, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  Um, they'll have something called a flame holder in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:18:50</a>:</strong>  And quite often it's just the, the aperture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:50">0:18:50-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  It's just the holes in your, in your stove top.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  Um, they create a turbulence and that turbulence is consistent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  It stays in one spot so that when the gas comes up and mixes with air, the flame is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:06</a>:</strong>  always in one spot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:06">0:19:06-0:19:11</a>:</strong>  Otherwise the flame will, yeah, it'll, it'll be a regular, it'll seek around and they can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:11">0:19:11-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  put itself out like in a propane stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:15</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:15">0:19:15-0:19:20</a>:</strong>  Um, so this creates a flame holder inside the rocket stove itself in the burn tunnel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:23</a>:</strong>  so that then the flame stopped seeking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:23">0:19:23-0:19:26</a>:</strong>  It's always in a consistent spot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:26">0:19:26-0:19:31</a>:</strong>  Um, and it has more time to burn itself completely and run the fire out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:31">0:19:31-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  And quite often you won't even see flames in the heat riser at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:40</a>:</strong>  The fuel will be completely burned, um, before it even gets to the riser.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:40">0:19:40-0:19:41</a>:</strong>  Gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:41">0:19:41-0:19:47</a>:</strong>  And so is this, are any of these techniques something that can be integrated in with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:47">0:19:47-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  batch box?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:53</a>:</strong>  Because all the configurations that I've seen are even simpler than what we've described<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:53">0:19:53-0:19:54</a>:</strong>  here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:54">0:19:54-0:19:57</a>:</strong>  So you're trying to break it down from the beginning for the batch box?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:57">0:19:57-0:19:59</a>:</strong>  Batch boxes have all of those features in them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:19:59">0:19:59-0:20:01</a>:</strong>  They just look a little different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:01">0:20:01-0:20:02</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:02">0:20:02-0:20:09</a>:</strong>  So what a batch box is, is, is, is as I said before, it's a much larger feed box so you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:09">0:20:09-0:20:11</a>:</strong>  could stick in a whole batch of wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:11">0:20:11-0:20:13</a>:</strong>  It's like a, like a regular wood stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:13">0:20:13-0:20:14</a>:</strong>  Kind of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:14">0:20:14-0:20:18</a>:</strong>  You put a front door on it, you open the door, you start your fire, you put the wood in,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:18">0:20:18-0:20:26</a>:</strong>  you close the door and it burns about four times as much at one given moment as, um,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:26">0:20:26-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  as a J-Tube will.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:29">0:20:29-0:20:31</a>:</strong>  You can burn, um, what's it called?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:31">0:20:31-0:20:33</a>:</strong>  You can burn cordwood in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:33">0:20:33-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  You can put regular cordwood firewood instead of having to chop up your firewood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:37">0:20:37-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  Well, depending on where you live, of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:40</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:40">0:20:40-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:44</a>:</strong>  And that's actually why I first started to experiment with them is because when I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:44">0:20:44-0:20:50</a>:</strong>  building these stoves for the Guatemalan women in my town, their biggest complaint was that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:50">0:20:50-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  they had to cut all this kindling to put into the J configuration and they didn't want the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:20:56</a>:</strong>  extra chore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:20:56">0:20:56-0:21:00</a>:</strong>  So they wanted to be able to, to put in cordwood or larger diameter wood and not have to break<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:00">0:21:00-0:21:01</a>:</strong>  it down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:01">0:21:01-0:21:02</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:02">0:21:02-0:21:08</a>:</strong>  Well, if you're cutting down huge trees or you know, trees in order to make firewood,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:08">0:21:08-0:21:09</a>:</strong>  that's an advantage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:09">0:21:09-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:13</a>:</strong>  This is assuming you have a better fuel source than what these were originally designed to,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:13">0:21:13-0:21:14</a>:</strong>  to solve.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:14">0:21:14-0:21:15</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:15">0:21:15-0:21:18</a>:</strong>  I mean, if you're going out and you're basically harvesting stick wood, it's not necessarily<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:18">0:21:18-0:21:19</a>:</strong>  an advantage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:19">0:21:19-0:21:20</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:20">0:21:20-0:21:25</a>:</strong>  Well, anyway, um, most of the folks that I know, you know, I live in these, in the States<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:25">0:21:25-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  and here it's all about cut down big trees and cordwood is ubiquitous, at least in the,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:33</a>:</strong>  out here in the country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:33">0:21:33-0:21:34</a>:</strong>  It's ubiquitous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:34">0:21:34-0:21:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:35">0:21:35-0:21:37</a>:</strong>  It's being banned in most cities now I believe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:37">0:21:37-0:21:38</a>:</strong>  Huh.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:38">0:21:38-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:41</a>:</strong>  Like San Francisco.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:41">0:21:41-0:21:44</a>:</strong>  They're starting to ban straight up ban wood fires.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:44">0:21:44-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  I mean, it makes sense for the emissions within a city, but anyway,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:52</a>:</strong>  Only, only if you don't have efficient stoves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:52">0:21:52-0:21:53</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:53">0:21:53-0:21:54</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:54">0:21:54-0:21:57</a>:</strong>  But mostly the idea that this technology is this simple and exists.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:57">0:21:57-0:21:58</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:58">0:21:58-0:21:59</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:21:59">0:21:59-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:01">0:22:01-0:22:02</a>:</strong>  Let's see.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:02">0:22:02-0:22:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:03">0:22:03-0:22:04</a>:</strong>  And that just runs into this whole political thing that I don't even want to get in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:04">0:22:04-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  We'll do a whole nother episode on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:11</a>:</strong>  So anyway, um, so a batch rocket means you can put cordwood in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:11">0:22:11-0:22:14</a>:</strong>  And you can put more in at one time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:14">0:22:14-0:22:20</a>:</strong>  Um, but in order to do that and have it run efficiently, it will, there's still a heat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:20">0:22:20-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  riser in the back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:27</a>:</strong>  You have to inject air towards the back of the firebox.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:27">0:22:27-0:22:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:28">0:22:28-0:22:30</a>:</strong>  Uh, and that there is actually a P channel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:30">0:22:30-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  Gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:31">0:22:31-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  It's a slightly different configuration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:36</a>:</strong>  It comes from a different place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:36">0:22:36-0:22:42</a>:</strong>  Basically there's a pipe that goes in that injects the air and then it has to be shaped<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:42">0:22:42-0:22:48</a>:</strong>  a certain way so that, so that gas is flowing over it will draw air in, but it's essentially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:48">0:22:48-0:22:50</a>:</strong>  the same device.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:50">0:22:50-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:22:52</a>:</strong>  Um, okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:52">0:22:52-0:22:58</a>:</strong>  So then you have your batch rocket, your batch box feed part where the wood goes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:22:58">0:22:58-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  Now that's four times system size.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:05</a>:</strong>  Uh, have we defined system size yet?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:05">0:23:05-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  I don't think so.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:07</a>:</strong>  Let's go on up a bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:07">0:23:07-0:23:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah, take it back a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:09">0:23:09-0:23:11</a>:</strong>  And actually, how about this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:11">0:23:11-0:23:15</a>:</strong>  Before we get too much into the details of how these things are configured, quickly tell<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:19</a>:</strong>  us where I can, uh, send people to see images of this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:19">0:23:19-0:23:23</a>:</strong>  Cause I know it's going to help with understanding what you're talking about when nerds like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:23">0:23:23-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  me haven't spent so much time on your forums and have this all in their head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:28</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:28">0:23:28-0:23:33</a>:</strong>  Well there's a, there's, if you want batch rocket knowledge, you really want to go to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:33">0:23:33-0:23:35</a>:</strong>  batch rocket dot EU EU.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:35">0:23:35-0:23:38</a>:</strong>  Is that right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:38">0:23:38-0:23:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I think it's batch rocket dot EU.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:39">0:23:39-0:23:42</a>:</strong>  Well, you know what, I'll make sure I'll get all the links of this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:42">0:23:42-0:23:46</a>:</strong>  I'll put them on the show notes for this podcast along with your previous episode if people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:46">0:23:46-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  want to go look back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:23:52</a>:</strong>  And if any of you are struggling to follow along with this and need some visual cues,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:52">0:23:52-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  just check out the links on the website and follow along from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:23:56</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:56">0:23:56-0:23:57</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:57">0:23:57-0:23:58</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:23:58">0:23:58-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  Uh, having said that, it is, it's batch rocket B A T C H R O C K E T dot EU.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:03</a>:</strong>  My man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:03">0:24:03-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  Um, all right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:11</a>:</strong>  And that is, um, um, um, Peter Vandenberg site and he lays it all out, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:11">0:24:11-0:24:14</a>:</strong>  He just gives away the keys to the kingdom.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:14">0:24:14-0:24:15</a>:</strong>  It's a really good site.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:15">0:24:15-0:24:16</a>:</strong>  It's all fair.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:16">0:24:16-0:24:17</a>:</strong>  He's on point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:17">0:24:17-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  He's a, he's, he's a genius.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:19">0:24:19-0:24:21</a>:</strong>  I love that guy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:21">0:24:21-0:24:22</a>:</strong>  He's also a lot of fun to hang out with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:22">0:24:22-0:24:24</a>:</strong>  I'll tell you what.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:24">0:24:24-0:24:25</a>:</strong>  Nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:25">0:24:25-0:24:31</a>:</strong>  Um, and then, uh, you could also go to my forums, uh, at a donkey 32 dot pro boards<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:31">0:24:31-0:24:32</a>:</strong>  dot com.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:32">0:24:32-0:24:35</a>:</strong>  Uh, the whole thing is there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:35">0:24:35-0:24:41</a>:</strong>  And also the journey is there, you know, because, um, Peter did all of his testing and reported<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:41">0:24:41-0:24:45</a>:</strong>  every single iteration that he did on the forums.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:45">0:24:45-0:24:46</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:46">0:24:46-0:24:49</a>:</strong>  No, you can go way down the rabbit hole if you love this stuff as much as we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:49">0:24:49-0:24:50</a>:</strong>  Yeah, totally, totally, totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:50">0:24:50-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  I mean, you can learn not only how to build them, but how all the iterations that didn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:24:59</a>:</strong>  work plus why he was thinking what he was thinking when he did those iterations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:24:59">0:24:59-0:25:05</a>:</strong>  So yeah, if you're super nerdy into this stuff, that might be fun, but you don't have to know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:05">0:25:05-0:25:06</a>:</strong>  all that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:06">0:25:06-0:25:07</a>:</strong>  That's the point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:07">0:25:07-0:25:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:08">0:25:08-0:25:09</a>:</strong>  If you're not, then it's going to be tedious, but right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:09">0:25:09-0:25:13</a>:</strong>  So let's stick with the basic explanation for now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:13">0:25:13-0:25:14</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:14">0:25:14-0:25:18</a>:</strong>  So, so then you got your feed box, uh, and then you have this air injector in the back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:18">0:25:18-0:25:23</a>:</strong>  and right behind the air injector, the whole thing, Oh wait, Nope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:23">0:25:23-0:25:24</a>:</strong>  I'm sorry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:24">0:25:24-0:25:25</a>:</strong>  I'm sorry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:25">0:25:25-0:25:28</a>:</strong>  I did not talk about, uh, system size.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:28">0:25:28-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:30</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:34</a>:</strong>  So system size is based on, well, back in the day, it was based on what stove pipe you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:34">0:25:34-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  could find.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:41</a>:</strong>  Um, we would go to the dump and we'd pull out a bunch of junk stove pipe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:41">0:25:41-0:25:43</a>:</strong>  And then you look at the stove pipe and go, Oh, what have I got here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:43">0:25:43-0:25:46</a>:</strong>  I got a bunch of six inch stove pipe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:46">0:25:46-0:25:51</a>:</strong>  And now rocket stoves traditionally need to be built so that the feed and the heat riser<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:51">0:25:51-0:25:56</a>:</strong>  and all that stuff and all the tubing through a bench or whatever you're doing has to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:56">0:25:56-0:25:57</a>:</strong>  the same.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:57">0:25:57-0:25:59</a>:</strong>  It can never be smaller than system size.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:25:59">0:25:59-0:26:01</a>:</strong>  This is all classical stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:01">0:26:01-0:26:04</a>:</strong>  And so we would match it to the stove pipe we had.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:04">0:26:04-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:09</a>:</strong>  So if I got a bunch of six inch stove pipe, well, I'm going to make a six inch rocket<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:09">0:26:09-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:11</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:11">0:26:11-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:14</a>:</strong>  So, I mean, that kind of covers that quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:14">0:26:14-0:26:15</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:15">0:26:15-0:26:20</a>:</strong>  Um, uh, so what a batch rocket does interestingly enough is that, okay, so you have your four<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:20">0:26:20-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  times system size as your feed box, and then it narrows to 0.72% of system size at a place<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:34</a>:</strong>  that we call the throat, which is the very back of the feed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:34">0:26:34-0:26:39</a>:</strong>  Um, and then after the side, sometimes after the side, true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:39">0:26:39-0:26:43</a>:</strong>  The others, the sidewinder batch rocket, which has a, um, a side throat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:43">0:26:43-0:26:49</a>:</strong>  And then Peter Vandenberg has been playing around with his, um, his double shoebox idea,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:49">0:26:49-0:26:55</a>:</strong>  uh, which I say is not a rocket stove incidentally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:55">0:26:55-0:26:59</a>:</strong>  Um, but, uh, it's still an amazing thing and he has a throat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:26:59">0:26:59-0:27:04</a>:</strong>  It's actually vertical, it's above in the, above the firebox.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:04">0:27:04-0:27:05</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:05">0:27:05-0:27:12</a>:</strong>  Um, I, um, I'm saying that it's not a true rocket stove and Peter agrees with me, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:12">0:27:12-0:27:13</a>:</strong>  it's really cool thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:13">0:27:13-0:27:14</a>:</strong>  It's called a double shoebox.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:14">0:27:14-0:27:15</a>:</strong>  It's on the forums.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:15">0:27:15-0:27:16</a>:</strong>  Go check it out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:16">0:27:16-0:27:17</a>:</strong>  Nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:17">0:27:17-0:27:18</a>:</strong>  I'll have to check it out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:18">0:27:18-0:27:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's pretty nifty.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:20">0:27:20-0:27:26</a>:</strong>  Um, I think what they've done though is they've made a double shoebox that is a true rocket<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:26">0:27:26-0:27:31</a>:</strong>  stove and I haven't actually gotten into it deep enough to see, but I can tell there is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:31">0:27:31-0:27:34</a>:</strong>  a heat riser on it some kind of way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:34">0:27:34-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  Anyway, let's get off of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:43</a>:</strong>  So in the back of the batch rocket, there's a throat, uh, and that throat does exactly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:43">0:27:43-0:27:48</a>:</strong>  the same thing that, um, the tripwire does.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:48">0:27:48-0:27:57</a>:</strong>  Because it's a tall, narrow slot, um, gases and air have to kind of squeeze through it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:57">0:27:57-0:27:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:27:58">0:27:58-0:28:02</a>:</strong>  It's compressing it and causing that turbulence like the tripwire you're talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:02">0:28:02-0:28:03</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:03">0:28:03-0:28:04</a>:</strong>  That's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:04">0:28:04-0:28:07</a>:</strong>  It's a, it's like a venturi tube basically creates a venturi effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:07">0:28:07-0:28:08</a>:</strong>  Nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:08">0:28:08-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  Um, and yeah, the air comes swirling out on both sides into the riser, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:15</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:15">0:28:15-0:28:16</a>:</strong>  That's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:16">0:28:16-0:28:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:17">0:28:17-0:28:19</a>:</strong>  And then you have something called a double Rams horn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:19">0:28:19-0:28:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:20">0:28:20-0:28:24</a>:</strong>  I saw that when I built this one at my own house, I didn't end up keeping the thing almost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:24">0:28:24-0:28:27</a>:</strong>  because it ended up firing too hot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:27">0:28:27-0:28:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:28">0:28:28-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  I just end up scalding everything that I put on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:31">0:28:31-0:28:37</a>:</strong>  And I think if I go back in my, my videos, I've got a clip of us trying to use it as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:37">0:28:37-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  a barbecue and nearly like melting our cast iron pan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:43</a>:</strong>  It's too much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:43">0:28:43-0:28:45</a>:</strong>  It's entirely too much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:45">0:28:45-0:28:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's too much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:48">0:28:48-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  But you could build a tiny little four inch batch rocket, you know, a four inch system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:53">0:28:53-0:28:58</a>:</strong>  size batch rocket, which is also a little too much for just cooking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:58">0:28:58-0:28:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:28:59">0:28:59-0:29:00</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:00">0:29:00-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  But a little tiny four inch batch rocket with a tiny little firebox can heat up remarkably<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:06</a>:</strong>  large space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:06">0:29:06-0:29:07</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:07">0:29:07-0:29:08</a>:</strong>  That's the thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:08">0:29:08-0:29:14</a>:</strong>  So like after we talk about these, uh, configurations of the burn chambers, then we can go into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:14">0:29:14-0:29:18</a>:</strong>  all of the different iterations of how to use the heat and how to reclaim it and how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:18">0:29:18-0:29:21</a>:</strong>  to reroute it in different ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:21">0:29:21-0:29:25</a>:</strong>  Let's wrap up on the, the batch box at the bottom, and then we can talk about that whole<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:25">0:29:25-0:29:26</a>:</strong>  world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:26">0:29:26-0:29:28</a>:</strong>  I kind of think we just did that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:28">0:29:28-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  Um, uh, the, the one thing that note, I guess is that batch rocket heat risers tend to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:33">0:29:33-0:29:35</a>:</strong>  a little taller than usual.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:35">0:29:35-0:29:40</a>:</strong>  Uh, do you have off the top of your head, the, the ratios on that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:40">0:29:40-0:29:41</a>:</strong>  Oh boy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:41">0:29:41-0:29:44</a>:</strong>  Uh, yeah, I'm going to get that wrong.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:44">0:29:44-0:29:48</a>:</strong>  Um, I'm, I'm probably going to get forums are for, we don't have to go too nerdy on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:48">0:29:48-0:29:49</a>:</strong>  the episode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:49">0:29:49-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah, totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:29:56</a>:</strong>  And I've seen you do some really cool stuff with this in finding household items to build<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:29:56">0:29:56-0:30:01</a>:</strong>  this out of, because you know, some people will go way far into this and you know, get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:01">0:30:01-0:30:07</a>:</strong>  all of the proper insulative material, the firebrick welded doors, and you know, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:07">0:30:07-0:30:12</a>:</strong>  can be difficult for people to acquire or find something with the skill set to put together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:12">0:30:12-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  I've seen you do stuff like using a pot and pan lids that are glass as the, as the door<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:20</a>:</strong>  for one of these chambers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:20">0:30:20-0:30:24</a>:</strong>  What are some of the other materials that you've been able to play around with?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:24">0:30:24-0:30:28</a>:</strong>  Uh, well, you know, because everybody else is going high tech, I just figured that I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:28">0:30:28-0:30:29</a>:</strong>  don't need to go that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:29">0:30:29-0:30:30</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:30">0:30:30-0:30:38</a>:</strong>  So, um, I've been building, um, uh, uh, homemade, uh, moldable refractory materials out of,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:38">0:30:38-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  uh, uh, clay, rich dirt and wood, ash and cow manure and, um, and crushed up pottery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:47</a>:</strong>  called grog.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:47">0:30:47-0:30:54</a>:</strong>  Um, I have been using found objects to create, uh, like heat radiators.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:30:54">0:30:54-0:31:00</a>:</strong>  Um, as you said, Pyrex lids are great little past doors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:00">0:31:00-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  You could actually see the fire, which is one of the great things about, about that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  part blows people's minds when they start to see fires burning sideways or backwards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:11">0:31:11-0:31:15</a>:</strong>  And that's really where I get it with the, with the students where they get that wow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:15">0:31:15-0:31:16</a>:</strong>  factor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:16">0:31:16-0:31:17</a>:</strong>  Well, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:17">0:31:17-0:31:20</a>:</strong>  I mean, that's when, that's when my propeller really starts spinning, you know, and that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:20">0:31:20-0:31:23</a>:</strong>  what got me attracted to all the stuff for the first place is cause I've always been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  a little bit of a pyro, you know, but once you see a fire doing something that intuitively<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  is all kinds of wrong and yet is doing it, you know, you just go, wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:36">0:31:36-0:31:39</a>:</strong>  Um, anyway, so I also take apart physics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:39">0:31:39-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:46</a>:</strong>  I also take apart like old stove bodies and I use the old cast iron stove tops, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:31:47</a>:</strong>  with the removable plates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:47">0:31:47-0:31:51</a>:</strong>  So what's the main thing that people should be thinking about if they're trying out found<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:51">0:31:51-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  or alternative or natural, uh, alternatives to like purchased items, especially when it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:01</a>:</strong>  comes to enduring the type of heat that we're putting in here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:01">0:32:01-0:32:02</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:07</a>:</strong>  Well the number one thing to think about is the, you know, like don't build it in your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:07">0:32:07-0:32:10</a>:</strong>  house first.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:10">0:32:10-0:32:11</a>:</strong>  Go outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:11">0:32:11-0:32:16</a>:</strong>  You know, it goes without saying, but yes, one would think, but it's pretty surprising<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:16">0:32:16-0:32:21</a>:</strong>  how many people will make their first build a batch rocket really complicated thing because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:21">0:32:21-0:32:26</a>:</strong>  the batch rockets are not easy to build compared to like a J tube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:26">0:32:26-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:28</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:28">0:32:28-0:32:31</a>:</strong>  It's like a, and you got to get it just right or it doesn't burn quite right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:31">0:32:31-0:32:36</a>:</strong>  But anyway, you know, I've seen guys that will guys and gals that will go and say, well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:36">0:32:36-0:32:39</a>:</strong>  I really want a batch rocket because of all these things and no, I've never built a stove<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:42</a>:</strong>  before in my life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:42">0:32:42-0:32:45</a>:</strong>  And uh, I'm going to throw these 10 experiments into,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:45">0:32:45-0:32:49</a>:</strong>  Oh, I'm going to build it in my house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:49">0:32:49-0:32:50</a>:</strong>  Oh boy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:50">0:32:50-0:32:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:51">0:32:51-0:32:52</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:32:53</a>:</strong>  The recipe for disaster there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:53">0:32:53-0:32:57</a>:</strong>  And well, surprisingly nobody's died yet and nobody's house is burned down yet that I know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:57">0:32:57-0:32:58</a>:</strong>  of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:32:58">0:32:58-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  Let's not have anybody listening to this be the first one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:02</a>:</strong>  Let's keep that statistic where it is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:02">0:33:02-0:33:03</a>:</strong>  Right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:03">0:33:03-0:33:04</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:04">0:33:04-0:33:09</a>:</strong>  So, so the recommendation is build one outside, uh, maybe under a roof so you can do it in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:09">0:33:09-0:33:13</a>:</strong>  the winter time, but in a very safe place where you're not going to catch anything on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:13">0:33:13-0:33:14</a>:</strong>  fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:14">0:33:14-0:33:20</a>:</strong>  You're not going to, um, fill your house with CO2 or anything like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:20">0:33:20-0:33:21</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:25</a>:</strong>  Um, yeah, because they're actually, there's some things in there that are not totally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:25">0:33:25-0:33:28</a>:</strong>  obvious to make them work well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:28">0:33:28-0:33:31</a>:</strong>  And um, if you get it a little bit off, it won't work well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:31">0:33:31-0:33:36</a>:</strong>  So you want to do all your learning curve on something you can tear down and rebuild.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:36">0:33:36-0:33:40</a>:</strong>  So I think that would be my major piece of advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:40">0:33:40-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  Otherwise, my advice is if you're building an outside, do everything you can think of,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:48</a>:</strong>  screw up in every way you can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:48">0:33:48-0:33:51</a>:</strong>  Um, try things that are crazy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  Try things that don't work, that you know will work, but try it anyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:33:55">0:33:55-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  And then, you know, you'll narrow the field of what you can do and you'll get a clear<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:05</a>:</strong>  idea of how to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:05">0:34:05-0:34:06</a>:</strong>  Then you can go ahead and build it inside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:06">0:34:06-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:12</a>:</strong>  Have you found that any of the materials that you've tried just straight up don't hold up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:12">0:34:12-0:34:14</a>:</strong>  and could be dangerous if they start to fail?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:14">0:34:14-0:34:17</a>:</strong>  Cause I know certain metals will melt at these temperatures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:17">0:34:17-0:34:18</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:18">0:34:18-0:34:20</a>:</strong>  Don't put any metals inside a heat riser.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:20">0:34:20-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:26</a>:</strong>  Uh, well, you know, like unless you're building four inch rocket stove or less, that is not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:26">0:34:26-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  a batch rocket.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  And you do not insulate it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:35</a>:</strong>  And it's just something you want to throw in your truck, take to the beach and um, use<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:35">0:34:35-0:34:36</a>:</strong>  as like a little cooker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:36">0:34:36-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's yeah, fair enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:42</a>:</strong>  Those little four inch, really little ones you can make out of like paint cans too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:42">0:34:42-0:34:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah, totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:43">0:34:43-0:34:44</a>:</strong>  And those are cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:44">0:34:44-0:34:45</a>:</strong>  They are really fun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:45">0:34:45-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  You know, who doesn't want to do that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:34:51</a>:</strong>  You know, but that's where I got started by putting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:51">0:34:51-0:34:52</a>:</strong>  Like tin cans together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:52">0:34:52-0:34:53</a>:</strong>  I built the tin can rocket stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:53">0:34:53-0:34:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:54">0:34:54-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  It was in the old book, you know, it was like a one page thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:34:59</a>:</strong>  Tin can rocket stove, DIY.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:34:59">0:34:59-0:35:00</a>:</strong>  And that's a great craft.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:00">0:35:00-0:35:06</a>:</strong>  If you've got like adolescent kids who want to do some fire experiments and learn some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:06">0:35:06-0:35:07</a>:</strong>  things about science.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:07">0:35:07-0:35:10</a>:</strong>  I mean, that's where I would really have fun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:10">0:35:10-0:35:12</a>:</strong>  It's like teaching kids to do it on that scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:12">0:35:12-0:35:15</a>:</strong>  Obviously plenty of safety in mind, of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:15">0:35:15-0:35:16</a>:</strong>  Absolutely totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:16">0:35:16-0:35:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:17">0:35:17-0:35:18</a>:</strong>  So yeah, that doesn't work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:18">0:35:18-0:35:24</a>:</strong>  But if you're going to build like a homemade refractory material, man, test that stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:24">0:35:24-0:35:25</a>:</strong>  thoroughly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:25">0:35:25-0:35:26</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:26">0:35:26-0:35:29</a>:</strong>  Because not every clay will do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:29">0:35:29-0:35:32</a>:</strong>  Some are really low fire, some are much higher fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:32">0:35:32-0:35:37</a>:</strong>  You know, I've, I've now made some mistakes that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:37">0:35:37-0:35:42</a>:</strong>  And it hasn't caused any, you know, disasters yet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:42">0:35:42-0:35:45</a>:</strong>  But um, but but like clay heat risers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:45">0:35:45-0:35:48</a>:</strong>  Right, totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:48">0:35:48-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  I've had some clay heat risers, you know, perlite clay heat risers completely disintegrate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:55</a>:</strong>  at the bottom.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:55">0:35:55-0:35:59</a>:</strong>  And expose what is metal behind them, you know, because I'll use like an old piece of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:35:59">0:35:59-0:36:05</a>:</strong>  stovepipe and pack inside of that, a perlite clay heat riser.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:05">0:36:05-0:36:11</a>:</strong>  And so you know, I've had those things disintegrate because we didn't properly test the clay soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:11">0:36:11-0:36:13</a>:</strong>  before we started building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:15</a>:</strong>  So that's important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:15">0:36:15-0:36:16</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:16">0:36:16-0:36:20</a>:</strong>  How do you go about testing that clay to make sure that it'll hold up?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:20">0:36:20-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  I'll make a little test clay ball of my mix, you know, take, you know, dig up your dirt,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:32</a>:</strong>  your candidate soil, make a test ball and toss it inside a campfire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:32">0:36:32-0:36:36</a>:</strong>  And really get that thing rip roaring or inside a wood stove and just get it rip roaring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:36">0:36:36-0:36:40</a>:</strong>  Just turn that wood stove up to max, you know, like if you got a potbelly stove, make it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:40">0:36:40-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  glow red.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:48</a>:</strong>  I guess maybe I shouldn't encourage people to do that kind of thing, but we've said all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:48">0:36:48-0:36:51</a>:</strong>  our disclaimers, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:51">0:36:51-0:36:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I'm often accused of encouraging people to do dangerous and stupid things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:36:57">0:36:57-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  I mean, this is why I called you for this episode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  Nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:04</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:04">0:37:04-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  So what are you looking for to see if it has failed or if it succeeded?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:08">0:37:08-0:37:12</a>:</strong>  Is it just going to disintegrate in that heat or is it is it like major cracking?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:12">0:37:12-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, I mean the, the, the surest, the surest fire way of knowing it's not going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:21</a>:</strong>  to work is when you go back into the wood stove to dig it out and you can't find it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:21">0:37:21-0:37:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah, fair enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:22">0:37:22-0:37:24</a>:</strong>  You know, it will disintegrate completely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:24">0:37:24-0:37:30</a>:</strong>  That's the worst case scenario, but I mean, you could also see it, you could pull it out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:30">0:37:30-0:37:35</a>:</strong>  and it will basically turn to glass and big glassy bubbles all over the place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:35">0:37:35-0:37:36</a>:</strong>  All right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:36">0:37:36-0:37:41</a>:</strong>  That's not going to last very long as a heat riser typically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:41">0:37:41-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  That might work okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:48</a>:</strong>  And other parts of the firebox, but if it's turning into slag basically it looks like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:48">0:37:48-0:37:49</a>:</strong>  lava.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:49">0:37:49-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:51">0:37:51-0:37:52</a>:</strong>  Then, uh, that's not going to hold up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:52">0:37:52-0:37:58</a>:</strong>  Is it just too much silica or probably, you know, the constituency of your clay is wrong.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:37:58">0:37:58-0:38:00</a>:</strong>  It's um, yeah, I'm not sure exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:00">0:38:00-0:38:02</a>:</strong>  Maybe the alumina content is too low.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:02">0:38:02-0:38:03</a>:</strong>  The silica content's too high.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:03">0:38:03-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:05">0:38:05-0:38:06</a>:</strong>  I don't have a microscope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:06">0:38:06-0:38:07</a>:</strong>  I'm not going to go that far into it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:07">0:38:07-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  I'm not either.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:09</a>:</strong>  I have a visual cues.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:09">0:38:09-0:38:10</a>:</strong>  That's good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:10">0:38:10-0:38:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:11">0:38:11-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  It's just the wrong junk, you know?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:13">0:38:13-0:38:18</a>:</strong>  Um, I've never really bothered to get super deep into the chemistry of all this stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:18">0:38:18-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  Um, I, I never bought like a high end smoke detector.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:24</a>:</strong>  What are those things?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:24">0:38:24-0:38:27</a>:</strong>  A testo analyzer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:27">0:38:27-0:38:33</a>:</strong>  I sniff at the stove pipe, which your nose, your nose is actually more sensitive than<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:33">0:38:33-0:38:34</a>:</strong>  those testo analyzers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:34">0:38:34-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  It just won't give you a percentage of numbers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:38</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:38">0:38:38-0:38:39</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:43</a>:</strong>  So, you know, I sniff around a stovepipes and go, well, we can do better and you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:43">0:38:43-0:38:45</a>:</strong>  and then, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:45">0:38:45-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  Anyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:50</a>:</strong>  Um, so, you know, so I guess my thing is I've always been Mr. Low tech.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:50">0:38:50-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  I mean, but through that you, you can definitely come to the conclusions, the innovations and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:38:59</a>:</strong>  things that are actually going to work in practicality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:38:59">0:38:59-0:39:04</a>:</strong>  Maybe you don't have all of the stats and the engineering to back it up, but you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:04">0:39:04-0:39:08</a>:</strong>  pretty in and out, like what's going to work in the context that you're trying it out from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:08">0:39:08-0:39:09</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:09">0:39:09-0:39:13</a>:</strong>  And let's face it for most of us and our needs, we don't actually need to know that junk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:13">0:39:13-0:39:15</a>:</strong>  No one even knows what works and what doesn't work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:15">0:39:15-0:39:21</a>:</strong>  And I can transfer what works in a small, you know, letter form or email form to somebody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:21">0:39:21-0:39:24</a>:</strong>  on the other side of the globe and they can go out and just build it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:24">0:39:24-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:26</a>:</strong>  All right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:26">0:39:26-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  So we just talked about a lot of the options for low tech solutions to building these types<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  of things that will stand up to the heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:38</a>:</strong>  What are some of the conventional or I guess the materials that you could purchase that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:38">0:39:38-0:39:41</a>:</strong>  are more high performance to take out the guesswork if that's not where you want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:41">0:39:41-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  start?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:49</a>:</strong>  Well, you could buy a bad bag fire clay, which is, you know, it's a product that's used all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:49">0:39:49-0:39:51</a>:</strong>  the time and stoves and stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:51">0:39:51-0:39:58</a>:</strong>  You could also buy stuff called castable refractory, which is a kind of high temperature stove<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:39:58">0:39:58-0:40:03</a>:</strong>  cement or like a kind of high temperature concrete almost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:03">0:40:03-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:07</a>:</strong>  And that's like casting your own piece.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:07">0:40:07-0:40:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah, you can cast your own pieces.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:08">0:40:08-0:40:12</a>:</strong>  You can cast your own stove bodies and stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:12">0:40:12-0:40:17</a>:</strong>  Peter Vandenberg talks about that a lot in his batch rocket website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:17">0:40:17-0:40:20</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:20">0:40:20-0:40:27</a>:</strong>  And there's a lot of different varieties of stove cement and castable refractory.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:27">0:40:27-0:40:30</a>:</strong>  And I'm not really the guy that can recommend one over another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:30">0:40:30-0:40:32</a>:</strong>  Yeah, no, you're my low tech guy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:32">0:40:32-0:40:33</a>:</strong>  That's good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:33">0:40:33-0:40:34</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:34">0:40:34-0:40:39</a>:</strong>  And that's how I've always operated too, because a lot of these things were not easy to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:39">0:40:39-0:40:41</a>:</strong>  or even available when I was in Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:41">0:40:41-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  So I just learned the way you did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:44">0:40:44-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  So, all right, let's pivot again a little bit and talk about some of the upper configurations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:53</a>:</strong>  Once we've lit that fire, once we've got it into a heat riser, let's talk about some of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:53">0:40:53-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  the options for using it because we covered a little bit of, you know, the simplest one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:40:59">0:40:59-0:41:03</a>:</strong>  using the heat directly at the source for cooking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:03">0:41:03-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  But let's get an idea of some of the other ways that the heat can be leveraged.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:12</a>:</strong>  Well, as you mentioned, there's cooking, but you could also store it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:12">0:41:12-0:41:19</a>:</strong>  Okay, so you can shoot that heat into a metal box and radiate it immediately into the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:19">0:41:19-0:41:22</a>:</strong>  Okay, so radiative heat for a space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:22">0:41:22-0:41:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah, radiative heat for a space, which is nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:25">0:41:25-0:41:27</a>:</strong>  And there are a number of ways of doing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:27">0:41:27-0:41:31</a>:</strong>  Let's break down a few of those options because the one that I was more familiar with was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:31">0:41:31-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  up-turning an oil drum over the top of that and routing it through kind of an extended<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:41</a>:</strong>  exhaust system to hopefully try and radiate as much of that heat out before it leaves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:41">0:41:41-0:41:42</a>:</strong>  the building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:42">0:41:42-0:41:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's the classic rocker stove slash barrel slash bench thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:47">0:41:47-0:41:48</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:48">0:41:48-0:41:53</a>:</strong>  And that works great because you have a balance of instant radiated heat with sort of a stored<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:53">0:41:53-0:41:54</a>:</strong>  heat and a thermal mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:54">0:41:54-0:41:55</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:55">0:41:55-0:41:59</a>:</strong>  And if the thermal mass is made into a bench, then that stored heat can be enjoyed directly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:41:59">0:41:59-0:42:00</a>:</strong>  by sitting on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:00">0:42:00-0:42:01</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:01">0:42:01-0:42:03</a>:</strong>  That's pretty sweet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:03">0:42:03-0:42:04</a>:</strong>  But it's really heavy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:04">0:42:04-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  It takes up a lot of space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:07</a>:</strong>  Sure, sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:07">0:42:07-0:42:10</a>:</strong>  Quite an installation, especially if you've got a smaller living room.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:10">0:42:10-0:42:11</a>:</strong>  Right, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:13</a>:</strong>  It's a major installation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:13">0:42:13-0:42:20</a>:</strong>  And quite honestly, it's not the most efficient thing for storing that heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:20">0:42:20-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  Well, let me not use the word efficiency on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:30</a>:</strong>  But what it is, is it's not always most convenient because the bench has a pipe inside it and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:30">0:42:30-0:42:34</a>:</strong>  the pipe's going to be hotter near the stove and cooler on the other end.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:34">0:42:34-0:42:37</a>:</strong>  So whoever's sitting closest to the stove is getting the most heat and whoever's sitting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:37">0:42:37-0:42:40</a>:</strong>  farthest away from the stove is getting the least heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:40">0:42:40-0:42:41</a>:</strong>  Makes sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:41">0:42:41-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  How is it on maintenance?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:42:46</a>:</strong>  Because though I've used these systems, I've not lived with them for a long period of time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:46">0:42:46-0:42:50</a>:</strong>  and had to deal with cleaning out the exhaust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:50">0:42:50-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  That sort of depends on how you put it together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:42:53</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:53">0:42:53-0:42:57</a>:</strong>  Those pipe runs, you know, you have to be able to get in and pull the ash out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:57">0:42:57-0:42:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:58">0:42:58-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  So you need good clean outs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:02</a>:</strong>  How often is it sitting up though?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:02">0:43:02-0:43:04</a>:</strong>  How often did you have to clean out yours?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:04">0:43:04-0:43:05</a>:</strong>  Oh boy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:05">0:43:05-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  Maybe once every year or two.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:08</a>:</strong>  Couple years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:08">0:43:08-0:43:09</a>:</strong>  Okay, so not too bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:09">0:43:09-0:43:13</a>:</strong>  It's not like every couple of months you've got to open the thing up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:13">0:43:13-0:43:14</a>:</strong>  No, no, no.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:14">0:43:14-0:43:19</a>:</strong>  Like every four or five fires, I'll clean out the firebox itself, like pull the ash<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:19">0:43:19-0:43:21</a>:</strong>  out of the box.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:21">0:43:21-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  And then maybe every year I'll open it up and look inside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  And maybe every two years, three years, I'll actually clean it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:30">0:43:30-0:43:31</a>:</strong>  Gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:31">0:43:31-0:43:39</a>:</strong>  You know, because ash will find the most inconvenient place to pile up and it'll pile up right there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:39">0:43:39-0:43:44</a>:</strong>  So if you don't have a clean out opening into that, then you're going to have a hell of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:44">0:43:44-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  a time getting it out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  Makes sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:53</a>:</strong>  But if you're clever or you're just thinking about it, you know, you put clean outs in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:53">0:43:53-0:43:55</a>:</strong>  the right spots, it makes it so easy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:43:55">0:43:55-0:44:00</a>:</strong>  And is that mostly like around elbows or places where it starts to...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:00">0:44:00-0:44:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:01">0:44:01-0:44:02</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:02">0:44:02-0:44:06</a>:</strong>  Like a wide spot in the flow will do it too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:06">0:44:06-0:44:07</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:07">0:44:07-0:44:12</a>:</strong>  Usually they'll have a little bit of dropout just below the heat riser on the bottom end<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:12">0:44:12-0:44:13</a>:</strong>  of the barrel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:13">0:44:13-0:44:16</a>:</strong>  You'll get a lot of pile up right there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:16">0:44:16-0:44:22</a>:</strong>  And then you'll get another pile, probably if you run down the bench and then make a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:22">0:44:22-0:44:28</a>:</strong>  180 and come back to the bench down at your 180 area, you'll end up with some stuff piled<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:28">0:44:28-0:44:29</a>:</strong>  up there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:29">0:44:29-0:44:34</a>:</strong>  And a thin skim all the way along often as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:34">0:44:34-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  And it's mostly just a matter of running a large, like a duct cleaner or almost like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:39">0:44:39-0:44:41</a>:</strong>  a chimney sweep apparatus.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:41">0:44:41-0:44:45</a>:</strong>  I don't know what they're called, but to go in and kind of sweep out the interior of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:45">0:44:45-0:44:46</a>:</strong>  exhaust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:46">0:44:46-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:48">0:44:48-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  If you got electricity, running a shop vac down that is nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:44:52</a>:</strong>  Oh, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:52">0:44:52-0:44:55</a>:</strong>  With an extendo hose on it, you need to stick the hose in and...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:55">0:44:55-0:44:57</a>:</strong>  That's not too bad then.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:57">0:44:57-0:44:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:58">0:44:58-0:44:59</a>:</strong>  It doesn't have to be that bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:44:59">0:44:59-0:45:03</a>:</strong>  I've made a little thing like a long hoe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:03">0:45:03-0:45:10</a>:</strong>  You know, it's usually a very small hoe head on a really long handle if you don't have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:10">0:45:10-0:45:11</a>:</strong>  the electricity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:11">0:45:11-0:45:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:12">0:45:12-0:45:14</a>:</strong>  But then you need to be in a kind of...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:14">0:45:14-0:45:19</a>:</strong>  The clean out has to be set in such a way that you could actually use a long handled<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:19">0:45:19-0:45:20</a>:</strong>  hoe on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:20">0:45:20-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:23</a>:</strong>  Because if it's near a wall, that's not happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:23">0:45:23-0:45:24</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:24">0:45:24-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  So you kind of got to think this one out before...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:29</a>:</strong>  Requires some planning ahead of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:29">0:45:29-0:45:30</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:30">0:45:30-0:45:32</a>:</strong>  It's a major installation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:32">0:45:32-0:45:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah, they are a major installation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:35">0:45:35-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  So another way of going about that, something that I prefer now actually is something called<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:44</a>:</strong>  a bell.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:45:50</a>:</strong>  And what a bell is, is it's just a large chamber that the heat enters the large chamber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:50">0:45:50-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  Well, okay, so it's a large chamber that has its exhaust, its chimney exhaust at the very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  bottom.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:46:03</a>:</strong>  So that when heat enters this chamber, it will go into this sort of free gas movement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:03">0:46:03-0:46:09</a>:</strong>  It's sort of a natural convective mode where the hotter stuff will tenderize to the top<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:09">0:46:09-0:46:12</a>:</strong>  and the cooler stuff in there will tend to go to the bottom and find the chimney.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:12">0:46:12-0:46:15</a>:</strong>  How large of a chamber are we talking in general here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:15">0:46:15-0:46:21</a>:</strong>  Well, that's going to depend on the size of the firebox and how much heat you're producing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:21">0:46:21-0:46:30</a>:</strong>  Because the chamber is sized, it's about the internal surface area of that thing and also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:30">0:46:30-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  what it's made out of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:39</a>:</strong>  So the barrel over your heat riser could be treated like a bell by raising the barrel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:39">0:46:39-0:46:40</a>:</strong>  up a ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:40">0:46:40-0:46:41</a>:</strong>  Right, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:41">0:46:41-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  Right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:47</a>:</strong>  So that, I mean, but that because it's steel, it's going to radiate heat faster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:47">0:46:47-0:46:53</a>:</strong>  So you're going to have a smaller bell than if it was, say, made out of brick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:53">0:46:53-0:46:54</a>:</strong>  Gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:46:54">0:46:54-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  Right, because brick will transfer heat slower and reach the saturation point where there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:07</a>:</strong>  so much heat in the brick itself that it won't transfer heat out of the flow of the gases<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:07">0:47:07-0:47:10</a>:</strong>  anymore properly or not very fast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:10">0:47:10-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  You know?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:12">0:47:12-0:47:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:13">0:47:13-0:47:14</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:14">0:47:14-0:47:16</a>:</strong>  And do you have a preference one or the other over that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:16">0:47:16-0:47:20</a>:</strong>  I guess it's just how fast you want to heat a space and for how long?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:20">0:47:20-0:47:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:22">0:47:22-0:47:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:23">0:47:23-0:47:24</a>:</strong>  That's sort of a personal preference thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:24">0:47:24-0:47:27</a>:</strong>  You know, if you're in a big shop, you know, you don't really need a lot of thermal mass<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:27">0:47:27-0:47:30</a>:</strong>  because you only need the place to be heated up while you're in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:30">0:47:30-0:47:31</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:31">0:47:31-0:47:34</a>:</strong>  So if you're in it and you're, you know, you're working and then you're out of it, you don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:34">0:47:34-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  need storage for overnight.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:40</a>:</strong>  So a big, a big metal box is preferable, I think there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:40">0:47:40-0:47:44</a>:</strong>  Um, every aspect of design context is everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:44">0:47:44-0:47:45</a>:</strong>  Everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:45">0:47:45-0:47:46</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:46">0:47:46-0:47:50</a>:</strong>  You know, if you live in a home and you want to sleep warm all night, you know, but you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:50">0:47:50-0:47:55</a>:</strong>  don't want to get up every couple hours to feed the fire, then you want, you want a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:55">0:47:55-0:47:56</a>:</strong>  of thermal mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:56">0:47:56-0:47:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:57">0:47:57-0:47:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:58">0:47:58-0:47:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:47:59">0:47:59-0:48:02</a>:</strong>  You know, it's like ovens, you know, bread ovens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:02">0:48:02-0:48:08</a>:</strong>  Um, the old traditional earth and bread ovens are very big, very heavy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:08">0:48:08-0:48:10</a>:</strong>  They have lots and lots of thermal mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:10">0:48:10-0:48:17</a>:</strong>  Um, because the entire village would get together on a Saturday and everyone would cook, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:17">0:48:17-0:48:21</a>:</strong>  know, and so one big fire the night before and another big fire in the morning and now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:21">0:48:21-0:48:23</a>:</strong>  you're cooking all day long.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:23">0:48:23-0:48:24</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:24">0:48:24-0:48:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:25">0:48:25-0:48:26</a>:</strong>  And that makes a lot of sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:26">0:48:26-0:48:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:27">0:48:27-0:48:30</a>:</strong>  Some of the traditional bakeries that I saw in Morocco would still offer that as a, as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:30">0:48:30-0:48:31</a>:</strong>  a service.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:31">0:48:31-0:48:37</a>:</strong>  You could bring your own homemade loaves and they'll bake them for you there for a couple<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:37">0:48:37-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  of cents.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:39">0:48:39-0:48:41</a>:</strong>  And it's cool that parts of communities are still intact like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:41">0:48:41-0:48:43</a>:</strong>  I mean, that's really cool, but okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:43">0:48:43-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  But take it like look at here in the States, um, where an earthen oven is going to be in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:56</a>:</strong>  one guy's backyard and it's going to be used to throw pizza in an evening on Saturday only,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:48:56">0:48:56-0:49:00</a>:</strong>  you know, that guy doesn't, it's just an installation that doesn't really get used.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:00">0:49:00-0:49:01</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:01">0:49:01-0:49:03</a>:</strong>  So that guy doesn't need a lot of thermal mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:03">0:49:03-0:49:06</a>:</strong>  And because if you're just throwing pizza, you're going to keep the fire in the back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:06">0:49:06-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  of the oven anyway, what you really want is less thermal mass and maybe more insulation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:12</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:12">0:49:12-0:49:19</a>:</strong>  So it's all about not just, um, you know, well it's, it's all about your pattern of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:19">0:49:19-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:21</a>:</strong>  Mm hmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:21">0:49:21-0:49:26</a>:</strong>  Um, so anyway, so back to the rock of mastos, um,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:26">0:49:26-0:49:27</a>:</strong>  Those okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:27">0:49:27-0:49:29</a>:</strong>  So we, we covered a little bit about the bells.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:29">0:49:29-0:49:32</a>:</strong>  Where does the exhaust go after it leaves that chamber?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:32">0:49:32-0:49:37</a>:</strong>  Like you said, the convection is going to push the colder gases down below and keep<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:37">0:49:37-0:49:40</a>:</strong>  the hotter ones in that chamber to radiate out into the space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:40">0:49:40-0:49:41</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:41">0:49:41-0:49:44</a>:</strong>  So as they cool, they drop down on the gate into your chimney.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:44">0:49:44-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  Now there, this is where you have to be careful about your sizing of your mass because if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:54</a>:</strong>  you soak up too much of the heat and the flow, then the gases may, you know, your exhaust<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:54">0:49:54-0:49:56</a>:</strong>  may not rise out the chimney anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:56">0:49:56-0:49:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:57">0:49:57-0:49:58</a>:</strong>  You could, you have an issue of it backing up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:58">0:49:58-0:49:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:49:59">0:49:59-0:50:03</a>:</strong>  So you need, you need that chimney exhaust at the point of exhaust, you know, where it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:03">0:50:03-0:50:06</a>:</strong>  leaves the pipes and goes out into the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:06">0:50:06-0:50:11</a>:</strong>  Not to drop below for safety sake, about 200 degrees Fahrenheit or around a hundred degrees<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:11">0:50:11-0:50:12</a>:</strong>  Celsius.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:12">0:50:12-0:50:13</a>:</strong>  Mm hmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:13">0:50:13-0:50:14</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:14">0:50:14-0:50:15</a>:</strong>  So, so that's sort of the safety point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:15">0:50:15-0:50:20</a>:</strong>  Now I built stoves that exhaust at much lower temperatures than that, but it's not a good<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:20">0:50:20-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:21">0:50:21-0:50:26</a>:</strong>  You know, I mean on one hand you get to keep more heat inside the building, but there are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:26">0:50:26-0:50:30</a>:</strong>  times and days where you won't be able to start the stove at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:30">0:50:30-0:50:34</a>:</strong>  If you do that, you'll have to find a way to prime it somehow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:34">0:50:34-0:50:35</a>:</strong>  Even if you prime it, it'll stall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:35">0:50:35-0:50:36</a>:</strong>  It'll stall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:36">0:50:36-0:50:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:37">0:50:37-0:50:38</a>:</strong>  Well, okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:38">0:50:38-0:50:39</a>:</strong>  So here's a condition, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:39">0:50:39-0:50:43</a>:</strong>  So you are in a cob house, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:43">0:50:43-0:50:46</a>:</strong>  Great thermal mass, but it goes cold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:46">0:50:46-0:50:51</a>:</strong>  You know, let's say it's gone cold and you have a warm day outside, but the cob is cold<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:51">0:50:51-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  inside the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:53</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:53">0:50:53-0:50:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:54">0:50:54-0:50:55</a>:</strong>  And you want to get that fire started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:50:55">0:50:55-0:51:01</a>:</strong>  You want to warm up the house and for some silly reason, you're inside on a beautiful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:05</a>:</strong>  warm day in a cold house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:05">0:51:05-0:51:06</a>:</strong>  You're not going to start that fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:06">0:51:06-0:51:10</a>:</strong>  No, it's going to be reverse exhausting the whole time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:10">0:51:10-0:51:12</a>:</strong>  It's going to reverse run in your face.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:12">0:51:12-0:51:17</a>:</strong>  And, and even if you do have a primer box and you get the chimney hot temporarily, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:17">0:51:17-0:51:19</a>:</strong>  not going to last.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:19">0:51:19-0:51:20</a>:</strong>  Mm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:20">0:51:20-0:51:23</a>:</strong>  Um, so that's a disadvantage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:23">0:51:23-0:51:28</a>:</strong>  Also like here in my stove at home, uh, in, in the little hut that I live in, um, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:28">0:51:28-0:51:29</a>:</strong>  called a huckleberry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:29">0:51:29-0:51:30</a>:</strong>  It's a cute little hut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:30">0:51:30-0:51:32</a>:</strong>  It is a cute little hut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:32">0:51:32-0:51:40</a>:</strong>  Um, so what I've got an issue in there in that my exhaust temperature is so low on that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:40">0:51:40-0:51:45</a>:</strong>  stove that the chimney is cold to the touch always.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:45">0:51:45-0:51:46</a>:</strong>  Right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:46">0:51:46-0:51:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:47">0:51:47-0:51:54</a>:</strong>  Um, and if it rains like big rainy nights, even though it's cold, it's warmer inside<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:54">0:51:54-0:51:55</a>:</strong>  the hut than the outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:55">0:51:55-0:51:59</a>:</strong>  So you're getting positive pressure effects of a warmer space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:51:59">0:51:59-0:52:05</a>:</strong>  If rain actively runs down my chimney pipe on the outside, it'll cool the exhaust off<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:05">0:52:05-0:52:08</a>:</strong>  to the point where it'll start backfiring on the inside of the building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:08">0:52:08-0:52:09</a>:</strong>  Right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:09">0:52:09-0:52:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:10">0:52:10-0:52:15</a>:</strong>  So, yeah, maybe not the cleverest thing that I decided, Hey, let's keep more heat inside<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:15">0:52:15-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  the building, shall we didn't, doesn't always work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:21</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:21">0:52:21-0:52:25</a>:</strong>  You don't really get to test it out until those circumstances arise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:25">0:52:25-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  Sometimes it's hard to predict.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I thought it'd be okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:27">0:52:27-0:52:32</a>:</strong>  Cause most of the time it runs great except for that coldest night of the year when it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:32">0:52:32-0:52:37</a>:</strong>  also raining, which is sort of reverse of what you think.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:37">0:52:37-0:52:42</a>:</strong>  But you know, again, like if it, because I live in it now all the time, that happens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:42">0:52:42-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  less and less and less because I keep the space warm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:47</a>:</strong>  I keep the chimney warm, you know?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:47">0:52:47-0:52:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:49">0:52:49-0:52:50</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:50">0:52:50-0:52:53</a>:</strong>  So let's talk about some of the other things that you can do with that heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:53">0:52:53-0:52:58</a>:</strong>  Other ways of maybe reclaiming exhaust or using it to heat water or some other element.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:58">0:52:58-0:52:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:52:59">0:52:59-0:53:00</a>:</strong>  Again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:00">0:53:00-0:53:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:01">0:53:01-0:53:02</a>:</strong>  You can use it to heat water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:02">0:53:02-0:53:04</a>:</strong>  I like putting a hot water tank inside of a bell chamber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:04">0:53:04-0:53:06</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:06">0:53:06-0:53:08</a>:</strong>  That works really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:08">0:53:08-0:53:14</a>:</strong>  I try not to teach people how to build hot water systems because water is sort of a steam<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:14">0:53:14-0:53:16</a>:</strong>  explosion problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:16">0:53:16-0:53:17</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:17">0:53:17-0:53:21</a>:</strong>  If you don't have a pressure release valve somewhere on that, you're yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:21">0:53:21-0:53:23</a>:</strong>  If things go wrong, you've built a bomb.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:23">0:53:23-0:53:24</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:24">0:53:24-0:53:28</a>:</strong>  If things go wrong, you built a bomb and, and there is actually a great system designed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:28">0:53:28-0:53:30</a>:</strong>  by Tim Barker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:30">0:53:30-0:53:34</a>:</strong>  Um, uh, he, he did it at Tagari farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:34">0:53:34-0:53:35</a>:</strong>  You might've seen this already.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:35">0:53:35-0:53:37</a>:</strong>  It's a double boiler system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:37">0:53:37-0:53:39</a>:</strong>  I haven't seen this one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:39">0:53:39-0:53:40</a>:</strong>  This is so cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:40">0:53:40-0:53:46</a>:</strong>  So what you do is you heat up, you directly heat an open pot, an open tank of water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:46">0:53:46-0:53:50</a>:</strong>  And inside that you put a pressurized coil, a copper coil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:50">0:53:50-0:53:55</a>:</strong>  So because you're directly heating up an open, open container, the open container can just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:55">0:53:55-0:53:56</a>:</strong>  steam away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:56">0:53:56-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  No pressure can build up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:53:58</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:53:58">0:53:58-0:54:00</a>:</strong>  Well, hotter than boiling point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:00">0:54:00-0:54:01</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:01">0:54:01-0:54:04</a>:</strong>  It'll never get hotter than the boiling point of whatever altitude you're at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:04">0:54:04-0:54:08</a>:</strong>  Um, 212 degrees Fahrenheit at sea level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:08">0:54:08-0:54:09</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:09">0:54:09-0:54:16</a>:</strong>  Um, but because pressurized water has a higher boiling temperature, the coil that's inside<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:16">0:54:16-0:54:22</a>:</strong>  of that open tank, uh, cannot, cannot boil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:22">0:54:22-0:54:23</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:23">0:54:23-0:54:28</a>:</strong>  So then what you do is you use the, um, the big tank that you're heating directly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:28">0:54:28-0:54:31</a>:</strong>  That's your sort of a heat storage zone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:31">0:54:31-0:54:35</a>:</strong>  And then the copper coil running through that is taking heat from that and taking that to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:35">0:54:35-0:54:38</a>:</strong>  your shower or whatever your hot water uses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:38">0:54:38-0:54:39</a>:</strong>  Cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:39">0:54:39-0:54:40</a>:</strong>  That's very cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:40">0:54:40-0:54:41</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:41">0:54:41-0:54:45</a>:</strong>  That's a clever application built in safety system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:45">0:54:45-0:54:46</a>:</strong>  You don't even need a pressure, anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:46">0:54:46-0:54:49</a>:</strong>  You don't need a pressure relief valve or any of that stuff because you could totally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:49">0:54:49-0:54:51</a>:</strong>  just boil out the big tank.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:51">0:54:51-0:54:56</a>:</strong>  And as long as the coil doesn't touch the sides, you know, I suspended from wire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:56">0:54:56-0:54:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:57">0:54:57-0:54:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:54:58">0:54:58-0:55:00</a>:</strong>  As long as the coil doesn't touch the sides, it can't blow up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:00">0:55:00-0:55:02</a>:</strong>  Oh, I'm going to have to check that out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:02">0:55:02-0:55:03</a>:</strong>  That's really cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:03">0:55:03-0:55:04</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:04">0:55:04-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  Have you ever played around with heating other elements like oil that do have a much higher<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:14</a>:</strong>  boiling temp kind of for safety reasons, but can also store a lot of that heat that way?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:14">0:55:14-0:55:16</a>:</strong>  I have not done that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:16">0:55:16-0:55:18</a>:</strong>  That's a really interesting thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:18">0:55:18-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  I've always thought about heating oil directly then to heat water somehow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:22">0:55:22-0:55:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:23">0:55:23-0:55:26</a>:</strong>  By running water through it like a, like through a pipe or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:26">0:55:26-0:55:27</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:27">0:55:27-0:55:32</a>:</strong>  That's a little dangerous though, because some oil you can get to like 400 degrees dangerous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:32">0:55:32-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  And then you go running water through a pipe that's in 400 degree Fahrenheit oil, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:40</a>:</strong>  this is where you got to put in those safety systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:40">0:55:40-0:55:41</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:41">0:55:41-0:55:43</a>:</strong>  But you might be able to run a steam engine off of something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:43">0:55:43-0:55:44</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:44">0:55:44-0:55:47</a>:</strong>  I guess I'm kind of little turbine going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:47">0:55:47-0:55:48</a>:</strong>  You bet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:48">0:55:48-0:55:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:49">0:55:49-0:55:50</a>:</strong>  I mean, that's a cool idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:50">0:55:50-0:55:51</a>:</strong>  I haven't done that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:51">0:55:51-0:55:56</a>:</strong>  I'd I'd like to someday, you know, maybe make a little steam engine off of that or something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:56">0:55:56-0:55:58</a>:</strong>  Sterling cycle engine that runs off of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:55:58">0:55:58-0:56:00</a>:</strong>  It'd be fun to play with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:00">0:56:00-0:56:01</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:01">0:56:01-0:56:05</a>:</strong>  Have you ever worked on trying to reclaim heat from a cook stove?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:05">0:56:05-0:56:08</a>:</strong>  Like putting something in the exhaust?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:08">0:56:08-0:56:09</a>:</strong>  Oh, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:09">0:56:09-0:56:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:10">0:56:10-0:56:16</a>:</strong>  I've done like a, had a cook stove that had multiple, multiple cooking areas, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:16">0:56:16-0:56:19</a>:</strong>  because there's, there's the spot right over the heat riser.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:19">0:56:19-0:56:20</a>:</strong>  That's really hot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:20">0:56:20-0:56:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:21">0:56:21-0:56:22</a>:</strong>  But just out of stream a couple of steps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:22">0:56:22-0:56:24</a>:</strong>  It's also still really hot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:24">0:56:24-0:56:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:25">0:56:25-0:56:26</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:26">0:56:26-0:56:31</a>:</strong>  You know, so, um, I'll have like a, a, a, a hot, fast boil heat area, a slow boil heat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:31">0:56:31-0:56:34</a>:</strong>  area, a simmer area and a warmer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:34">0:56:34-0:56:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:35">0:56:35-0:56:40</a>:</strong>  So somewhere in between the slow boil and the warmer, I'll put a little hot water heater,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:40">0:56:40-0:56:43</a>:</strong>  like the little coil hot water heater that we're talking that we just talked about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:43">0:56:43-0:56:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:44">0:56:44-0:56:45</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:45">0:56:45-0:56:46</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:46">0:56:46-0:56:47</a>:</strong>  That's a great thing right there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:47">0:56:47-0:56:51</a>:</strong>  Um, uh, you know, you can drop bricks in something like that and wrap a brick, that brick and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:51">0:56:51-0:56:53</a>:</strong>  a towel and take it to bed with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:53">0:56:53-0:56:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:54">0:56:54-0:56:56</a>:</strong>  Almost like a hot water bottle heater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:56">0:56:56-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:56:59</a>:</strong>  Kind of like a hot water bottle, et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:56:59">0:56:59-0:57:04</a>:</strong>  But you don't stand the risk of accidentally puncturing it and ending up with a wet bed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:04">0:57:04-0:57:08</a>:</strong>  One of the advantages, but then of course you're sleeping with a brick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:08">0:57:08-0:57:09</a>:</strong>  So that's true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:09">0:57:09-0:57:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:10">0:57:10-0:57:11</a>:</strong>  He's sleeping with a brick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:11">0:57:11-0:57:13</a>:</strong>  There's give and take on that one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:13">0:57:13-0:57:16</a>:</strong>  I always kind of thought about putting some kind of heat exchanger in it that would route<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:16">0:57:16-0:57:23</a>:</strong>  into a sauna and having that at a fairly constant heat whenever you're running another element<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:23">0:57:23-0:57:26</a>:</strong>  and then, you know, go in for a sauna after a meal or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:26">0:57:26-0:57:27</a>:</strong>  That sounds great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:27">0:57:27-0:57:33</a>:</strong>  Um, the amount of heat you need in a sauna though, depends on the design of the sauna<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:33">0:57:33-0:57:35</a>:</strong>  and how you're heating it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:35">0:57:35-0:57:39</a>:</strong>  If that's like in an open coil and it's heating the air directly through convection or if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:39">0:57:39-0:57:45</a>:</strong>  you're running it through a bank and like keeping a low level constant heat for a long<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:45">0:57:45-0:57:52</a>:</strong>  time, because depending on, I mean, I like the, the Temasco ceremonies in Guatemala or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:52">0:57:52-0:57:57</a>:</strong>  Mexico kind of run a little bit differently and they last a little longer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:57:57">0:57:57-0:58:00</a>:</strong>  So you can't have it as nearly high of a heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:00">0:58:00-0:58:03</a>:</strong>  It was one of the things that I was designing and building for clients a lot while I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:03">0:58:03-0:58:08</a>:</strong>  out there because so many people had the vacation homes and the climate was really nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:08">0:58:08-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  So they'd like have a pool and then they build these saunas and some of them would even use<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:13</a>:</strong>  them for ceremonies and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:13">0:58:13-0:58:17</a>:</strong>  Just got me thinking about a lot of different ways of using that heat in different ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:17">0:58:17-0:58:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I'd like to see that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:20">0:58:20-0:58:21</a>:</strong>  Oh, excuse me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:21">0:58:21-0:58:23</a>:</strong>  I'd like to see that sort of any designs that you've come up with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:23">0:58:23-0:58:27</a>:</strong>  Oh man, I was going to start designing one at our place before I left, but I didn't get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:27">0:58:27-0:58:30</a>:</strong>  a chance to do that before I've made the move now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:30">0:58:30-0:58:32</a>:</strong>  Well, yeah, well, well, okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:32">0:58:32-0:58:34</a>:</strong>  I'll talk to you about that later.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:34">0:58:34-0:58:35</a>:</strong>  Sure, sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:35">0:58:35-0:58:37</a>:</strong>  Where are you moving to?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:37">0:58:37-0:58:38</a>:</strong>  But later that's.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:38">0:58:38-0:58:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:39">0:58:39-0:58:42</a>:</strong>  Well, I mean, people who've been listening here probably already know I'm moving to Spain<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:42">0:58:42-0:58:44</a>:</strong>  actually one week from today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:44">0:58:44-0:58:46</a>:</strong>  So Oh, awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:46">0:58:46-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  That's going to be a cool new chapter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:58:48</a>:</strong>  I'll keep you posted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:48">0:58:48-0:58:51</a>:</strong>  I mean, I listen to your stuff all the time, but sometimes I don't get it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:51">0:58:51-0:58:55</a>:</strong>  So especially lately, I've been publishing a lot of them out of sequence because I recorded<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:58:55">0:58:55-0:59:01</a>:</strong>  a ton in Guatemala before I came out and I wanted to, you know, not be working too much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:01">0:59:01-0:59:03</a>:</strong>  or throw off my schedule.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:03">0:59:03-0:59:05</a>:</strong>  I was visiting family.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:05">0:59:05-0:59:09</a>:</strong>  So a lot of them are, you know, a handful of weeks old or like bundled into topics now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:09">0:59:09-0:59:10</a>:</strong>  Huh?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:10">0:59:10-0:59:11</a>:</strong>  And this one's good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:11">0:59:11-0:59:12</a>:</strong>  This one's going to be the same.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:12">0:59:12-0:59:14</a>:</strong>  This is going to come out after I've already moved to Spain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:14">0:59:14-0:59:15</a>:</strong>  So right, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:15">0:59:15-0:59:16</a>:</strong>  All right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:16">0:59:16-0:59:17</a>:</strong>  Well, I'll have to check that out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:17">0:59:17-0:59:18</a>:</strong>  I'll check that out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:18">0:59:18-0:59:19</a>:</strong>  All right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:19">0:59:19-0:59:23</a>:</strong>  So here, let's focus now on how these things can be leveraged in the home because you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:23">0:59:23-0:59:27</a>:</strong>  as you mentioned, there are certain areas that are banning wood stoves or wood combustion<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:27">0:59:27-0:59:31</a>:</strong>  in homes or within urban areas entirely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:31">0:59:31-0:59:35</a>:</strong>  What is your experience on making these safe enough and certainly clean enough that they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:35">0:59:35-0:59:37</a>:</strong>  don't pose a risk inside of a home?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:37">0:59:37-0:59:42</a>:</strong>  Well, I mean, you know, just build it well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:42">0:59:42-0:59:43</a>:</strong>  Build it well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:43">0:59:43-0:59:44</a>:</strong>  Seal up all the cracks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:44">0:59:44-0:59:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah, seal up all the cracks, build it well, operate it carefully.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:49">0:59:49-0:59:50</a>:</strong>  And it's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:50">0:59:50-0:59:53</a>:</strong>  Because quite often you can't even tell that there's a fire going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:53">0:59:53-0:59:58</a>:</strong>  You know, if you go out and stand out and you look at the chimney, you can't see smoke<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=0:59:58">0:59:58-1:00:01</a>:</strong>  coming out of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:01">1:00:01-1:00:05</a>:</strong>  You know, and if you're careful and you sort of move your head around, you can see heat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:05">1:00:05-1:00:07</a>:</strong>  waves coming out of it sometimes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:07">1:00:07-1:00:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:08">1:00:08-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  You know, so you know, somebody who doesn't know what the heck they're looking at, if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:17</a>:</strong>  they see a chimney pipe with heat waves coming out of it and not smoke, they're going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:17">1:00:17-1:00:19</a>:</strong>  go, oh, well, that's a propane device.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:19">1:00:19-1:00:22</a>:</strong>  Mmm, propane devices are legal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:22">1:00:22-1:00:23</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:23">1:00:23-1:00:28</a>:</strong>  If I understand you correctly, you're advocating for subversively installing these in cities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:28">1:00:28-1:00:33</a>:</strong>  Oh, I would never advocate for anything subversive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:33">1:00:33-1:00:35</a>:</strong>  Of course I am.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:35">1:00:35-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  But no, you know, actually what I advocate, you know, it's kind of hard to say that it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:43</a>:</strong>  a stupid law.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:43">1:00:43-1:00:47</a>:</strong>  But like everything is probably based in good intentions, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:47">1:00:47-1:00:51</a>:</strong>  But yeah, these are really on the fringe and most people don't know of this as an option<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:51">1:00:51-1:00:53</a>:</strong>  for wood combustion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:53">1:00:53-1:00:55</a>:</strong>  It's probably not factored into the lawmaking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:55">1:00:55-1:00:56</a>:</strong>  Right, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:00:56">1:00:56-1:01:03</a>:</strong>  Well, I mean, there's a lot of professional heat people like HVAC installers and stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:03">1:01:03-1:01:04</a>:</strong>  like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:04">1:01:04-1:01:06</a>:</strong>  They're saying that our claims are actually lies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:06">1:01:06-1:01:07</a>:</strong>  Mmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:07">1:01:07-1:01:10</a>:</strong>  You know, they're saying, no, it's a lie.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:10">1:01:10-1:01:12</a>:</strong>  You can't do that with wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:12">1:01:12-1:01:14</a>:</strong>  And you know, okay, fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:14">1:01:14-1:01:16</a>:</strong>  But uh, yes, again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:16">1:01:16-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  And here's the proof.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:18">1:01:18-1:01:20</a>:</strong>  Come see, here's my stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:20">1:01:20-1:01:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:21">1:01:21-1:01:28</a>:</strong>  But, um, you know, um, I think that what we really need is to have some people, a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:28">1:01:28-1:01:34</a>:</strong>  of people who want these stoves to go to their local regulatory body and say, check it out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:34">1:01:34-1:01:35</a>:</strong>  I've got this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:35">1:01:35-1:01:36</a>:</strong>  Here's some information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:36">1:01:36-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  Here's some documentation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:37">1:01:37-1:01:40</a>:</strong>  You know, here's a website or two.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:40">1:01:40-1:01:41</a>:</strong>  Here's the forums.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:41">1:01:41-1:01:42</a>:</strong>  You know, I want to build this thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:42">1:01:42-1:01:50</a>:</strong>  How can we get this put in to our local, you know, um, building codes?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:50">1:01:50-1:01:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:51">1:01:51-1:01:52</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:52">1:01:52-1:01:56</a>:</strong>  The thing that I like and that I've learned a lot from different forums and, um, and different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:01:56">1:01:56-1:02:00</a>:</strong>  discussions on this is when you break down the comparison of combustion of different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:00">1:02:00-1:02:07</a>:</strong>  materials, there's a lot of things that aren't factored into just the amount of BTUs put<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:07">1:02:07-1:02:09</a>:</strong>  out from a system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:09">1:02:09-1:02:10</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:10">1:02:10-1:02:14</a>:</strong>  So if you're using electricity or if you're using propane, what they're not considering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:14">1:02:14-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  in those calculations, it is all of the inefficiencies and pollution to get those things to the source<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:20</a>:</strong>  of use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:20">1:02:20-1:02:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's correct.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:22">1:02:22-1:02:28</a>:</strong>  Gathering firewood or sustainably harvesting from a forest is, has none of those embodied<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:28">1:02:28-1:02:33</a>:</strong>  carbon or pollution metrics that just get it to your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:33">1:02:33-1:02:34</a>:</strong>  That's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:34">1:02:34-1:02:36</a>:</strong>  And in fact, it could actually be a carbon negative system if you're careful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:36">1:02:36-1:02:37</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:37">1:02:37-1:02:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:38">1:02:38-1:02:39</a>:</strong>  If done correctly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:39">1:02:39-1:02:45</a>:</strong>  So can we start looking at the calculations from the entire aspect of how these things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:45">1:02:45-1:02:48</a>:</strong>  are used, sourced, uh, acquired to begin with?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:48">1:02:48-1:02:53</a>:</strong>  I mean, let's talk about all of the, uh, the losses in the electrical grid and how much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:53">1:02:53-1:02:57</a>:</strong>  is lost just transferring it through wires to say nothing about like, you know, whether<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:02:57">1:02:57-1:03:02</a>:</strong>  it's clean or what source is generating that electricity, which most of the time is still<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:02">1:03:02-1:03:06</a>:</strong>  not renewables, even if that's your, you know, your best case scenario.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:06">1:03:06-1:03:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I mean, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:07">1:03:07-1:03:08</a>:</strong>  Totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:08">1:03:08-1:03:10</a>:</strong>  I don't think I could put it any better than that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:10">1:03:10-1:03:16</a>:</strong>  You know, you have to see the entire life cycle of, of the fuel, not just where it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:16">1:03:16-1:03:17</a>:</strong>  point of use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:17">1:03:17-1:03:18</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:18">1:03:18-1:03:22</a>:</strong>  You know, it goes with so many things that we talk about on this show.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:22">1:03:22-1:03:27</a>:</strong>  I mean, you're very well aware of calculating those types of things when you're looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:27">1:03:27-1:03:29</a>:</strong>  at natural building materials, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:29">1:03:29-1:03:35</a>:</strong>  But you may be, um, doing a lot more work and processing to get them to be used as building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:35">1:03:35-1:03:38</a>:</strong>  materials on site.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:38">1:03:38-1:03:42</a>:</strong>  They also didn't have to be mined from somewhere a long way away, transported all the way there,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:42">1:03:42-1:03:48</a>:</strong>  or like certainly in the case of, uh, cement and stuff, you know, huge amounts of industrial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:48">1:03:48-1:03:52</a>:</strong>  processes and tons of fossil fuel burn just to transform the material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:52">1:03:52-1:03:53</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:53">1:03:53-1:03:59</a>:</strong>  I mean, to be honest with natural building, I have been shocked at myself at the kinds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:03:59">1:03:59-1:04:04</a>:</strong>  of compromises I have to make in order to build a natural building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:04">1:04:04-1:04:08</a>:</strong>  I mean, you know, tarps for mixing, you know, how much plastic junk has come out of this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:08">1:04:08-1:04:09</a>:</strong>  place because tarps get shredded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:09">1:04:09-1:04:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:10">1:04:10-1:04:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:11">1:04:11-1:04:18</a>:</strong>  You know, like it's, it's an imperfect system, you know, they all are, they all are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:18">1:04:18-1:04:19</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:19">1:04:19-1:04:22</a>:</strong>  And you know, so you have to make your compromises where you find them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:22">1:04:22-1:04:27</a>:</strong>  But um, back to natural building, I mean, back to a rocket mask heaters, you know, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:27">1:04:27-1:04:33</a>:</strong>  really can create a negative carbon system with a sustainable woodlot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:33">1:04:33-1:04:38</a>:</strong>  You know, if you're doing coppicing or something like that, you can grow more wood mass than<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:38">1:04:38-1:04:41</a>:</strong>  you use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:41">1:04:41-1:04:46</a>:</strong>  How much space would you, I mean, these are all going to be very rough estimates, very,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:46">1:04:46-1:04:52</a>:</strong>  um, dependent on context and variation, but how much, like, let's say for your amount<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:52">1:04:52-1:04:57</a>:</strong>  of use, which is quite minimal, I would imagine for the smaller spaces that you're living<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:04:57">1:04:57-1:05:01</a>:</strong>  in and such, how much space would you need to maybe grow all of that coppice to provide<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:01">1:05:01-1:05:03</a>:</strong>  for a year's consumption?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:03">1:05:03-1:05:04</a>:</strong>  Oh my goodness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:04">1:05:04-1:05:07</a>:</strong>  For my own personal use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:07">1:05:07-1:05:14</a>:</strong>  I wouldn't probably need more than like an acre of willow, you know, or less for my own<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:14">1:05:14-1:05:15</a>:</strong>  personal use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:15">1:05:15-1:05:16</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:16">1:05:16-1:05:18</a>:</strong>  But you know, I've got a bunch of buildings around here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:18">1:05:18-1:05:21</a>:</strong>  I've got my building and I've got, you know, the mud hut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:21">1:05:21-1:05:22</a>:</strong>  There's two.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:22">1:05:22-1:05:25</a>:</strong>  Well, actually they're not all in use right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:25">1:05:25-1:05:27</a>:</strong>  But I've got 10 cabins.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:27">1:05:27-1:05:30</a>:</strong>  Let's break it down to an easier to crunch calculation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:30">1:05:30-1:05:36</a>:</strong>  How much wood do you think you go through for your individual house in the season?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:36">1:05:36-1:05:37</a>:</strong>  My little mud hut.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:37">1:05:37-1:05:38</a>:</strong>  Oh my goodness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:38">1:05:38-1:05:41</a>:</strong>  I go through maybe less than an eighth of a cord.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:41">1:05:41-1:05:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:42">1:05:42-1:05:43</a>:</strong>  So it's really negligible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:43">1:05:43-1:05:44</a>:</strong>  It's tiny.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:44">1:05:44-1:05:45</a>:</strong>  It's a tiny amount.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:45">1:05:45-1:05:49</a>:</strong>  You know, I really can just go out in the forest and break off a bunch of dead fall,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:49">1:05:49-1:05:53</a>:</strong>  you know, just break dead branches off and bring in a bundle of wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:05:53">1:05:53-1:06:03</a>:</strong>  You know, maybe say 12 to 18 inches in diameter by, you know, about the same long.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:03">1:06:03-1:06:06</a>:</strong>  That bundle will last me three days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:06">1:06:06-1:06:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:07">1:06:07-1:06:08</a>:</strong>  You know, and heat my space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:08">1:06:08-1:06:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:09">1:06:09-1:06:13</a>:</strong>  You know, that's like the size of two logs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:13">1:06:13-1:06:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:15">1:06:15-1:06:17</a>:</strong>  You know, that keeps it in perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:17">1:06:17-1:06:22</a>:</strong>  And I mean, it goes with like this larger theme of learning to depend on the resources<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:22">1:06:22-1:06:27</a>:</strong>  in our own immediate areas for our own needs and kind of living within those means, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:27">1:06:27-1:06:28</a>:</strong>  know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:28">1:06:28-1:06:31</a>:</strong>  So this is a very appropriate technology within the context that you live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:31">1:06:31-1:06:33</a>:</strong>  You're close to a forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:33">1:06:33-1:06:36</a>:</strong>  And it would be all the more important to burn things that much more efficiently if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:36">1:06:36-1:06:41</a>:</strong>  you were in a place that had much scarcer resources for wood or higher competition for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:41">1:06:41-1:06:42</a>:</strong>  it within an area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:42">1:06:42-1:06:43</a>:</strong>  True.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:43">1:06:43-1:06:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:44">1:06:44-1:06:46</a>:</strong>  But I mean, I think that you could actually do this in cities as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:46">1:06:46-1:06:51</a>:</strong>  I mean, there's, depending on the city, of course, there's a lot of wood resource in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:51">1:06:51-1:06:54</a>:</strong>  a city that is currently pretty much just thrown away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:54">1:06:54-1:06:55</a>:</strong>  Oh, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:55">1:06:55-1:06:58</a>:</strong>  To say nothing of construction waste, just to begin with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:58">1:06:58-1:06:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:06:59">1:06:59-1:07:04</a>:</strong>  Construction waste, municipal trimmings, you name it, you know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:04">1:07:04-1:07:07</a>:</strong>  And you can make biomass pellets out of leaf drop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:07">1:07:07-1:07:08</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:08">1:07:08-1:07:11</a>:</strong>  If you needed to and burn that in a rocket stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:11">1:07:11-1:07:12</a>:</strong>  Have you tried that out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:12">1:07:12-1:07:16</a>:</strong>  I have not done the biomass thing, but I've seen other people who've done it really effectively.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:16">1:07:16-1:07:17</a>:</strong>  I would imagine it would work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:17">1:07:17-1:07:19</a>:</strong>  I just haven't had the chance to try it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:19">1:07:19-1:07:20</a>:</strong>  That's really cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:20">1:07:20-1:07:23</a>:</strong>  I mean, there's some people who have figured out how to do pellet stoves really well, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:23">1:07:23-1:07:25</a>:</strong>  know, to burn pellets and rocket heaters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:25">1:07:25-1:07:26</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:26">1:07:26-1:07:30</a>:</strong>  There's also been some pretty serious problems with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:30">1:07:30-1:07:31</a>:</strong>  Really?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:31">1:07:31-1:07:32</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:32">1:07:32-1:07:35</a>:</strong>  There's one guy, let's see, what's the name of his YouTube channel?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:35">1:07:35-1:07:38</a>:</strong>  What I really like about him is he's super honest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:38">1:07:38-1:07:39</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:39">1:07:39-1:07:41</a>:</strong>  Bigalowbrook Farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:41">1:07:41-1:07:47</a>:</strong>  He's, I forgot exactly where, but he's in a northern climate where things get really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:47">1:07:47-1:07:48</a>:</strong>  cold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:48">1:07:48-1:07:52</a>:</strong>  He's got himself a hydroponic system or an aquaponic system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:52">1:07:52-1:07:53</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:53">1:07:53-1:07:56</a>:</strong>  He's got fish in a system and he's got, you know, floating plants and all that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:07:56">1:07:56-1:08:02</a>:</strong>  But to keep it all warm, he built this rocket mass heater that he feeds pellets into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:02">1:08:02-1:08:06</a>:</strong>  Well, and it works pretty well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:06">1:08:06-1:08:11</a>:</strong>  But one day he accidentally, he didn't realize that a bag of pellets that he poured in was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:11">1:08:11-1:08:12</a>:</strong>  wet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:12">1:08:12-1:08:15</a>:</strong>  It had a little moisture in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:15">1:08:15-1:08:17</a>:</strong>  Are you there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:17">1:08:17-1:08:18</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:18">1:08:18-1:08:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:19">1:08:19-1:08:22</a>:</strong>  And so he pours it into his hopper and walks away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:22">1:08:22-1:08:26</a>:</strong>  Pours it, you know, lights it and walks away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:26">1:08:26-1:08:31</a>:</strong>  And so the hopper stopped descending, it stopped feeding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:31">1:08:31-1:08:36</a>:</strong>  So now it started smoldering up the hopper instead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:36">1:08:36-1:08:41</a>:</strong>  And it burned the entire bag of pellets backwards and smoked out the whole place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:41">1:08:41-1:08:42</a>:</strong>  Oh man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:42">1:08:42-1:08:46</a>:</strong>  Killed a bunch of fish, killed all his plants, like wiped that place out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:46">1:08:46-1:08:47</a>:</strong>  Yikes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:47">1:08:47-1:08:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:48">1:08:48-1:08:52</a>:</strong>  This is like the second or third horror story I've heard about using rocket stoves to heat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:52">1:08:52-1:08:53</a>:</strong>  greenhouses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:53">1:08:53-1:08:54</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:55">1:08:55-1:08:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:08:56">1:08:56-1:09:00</a>:</strong>  You know, like I'm not an advocate for using a rocket stove to heat greenhouses by the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:00">1:09:00-1:09:01</a>:</strong>  way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:01">1:09:01-1:09:05</a>:</strong>  I mean, it can be done, but you know, like chickens are better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:05">1:09:05-1:09:06</a>:</strong>  Fair enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:06">1:09:06-1:09:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:07">1:09:07-1:09:09</a>:</strong>  Or like a really big compost pile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:09">1:09:09-1:09:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:10">1:09:10-1:09:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:11">1:09:11-1:09:12</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:12">1:09:12-1:09:13</a>:</strong>  Compost piles and all that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:13">1:09:13-1:09:14</a>:</strong>  Anyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:14">1:09:14-1:09:15</a>:</strong>  Fewer things that go wrong.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:17">1:09:17-1:09:20</a>:</strong>  I've seen people do or, or, or other biomass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:20">1:09:20-1:09:22</a>:</strong>  I don't need to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:22">1:09:22-1:09:24</a>:</strong>  But I've seen other people do it to good effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:24">1:09:24-1:09:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:25">1:09:25-1:09:29</a>:</strong>  It seems like it's one of those areas that needs some more work, but shows some potential.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:30">1:09:30-1:09:35</a>:</strong>  And I know a guy who's working on burning plastics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:35">1:09:35-1:09:39</a>:</strong>  Which could be really useful in places where you have an overburden of plastic and no garbage<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:56">1:09:56-1:09:57</a>:</strong>  Well, that's promising.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:57">1:09:57-1:09:58</a>:</strong>  I'm going to try and keep an eye on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:09:58">1:09:58-1:10:02</a>:</strong>  Where in your opinion, do you still see a lot of room for improvement in these types<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:02">1:10:02-1:10:07</a>:</strong>  of stones and in efficient home heating and cooking in general?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:07">1:10:07-1:10:09</a>:</strong>  Ooh, room for improvement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:09">1:10:09-1:10:14</a>:</strong>  Well, I think the technology itself is pretty mature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:14">1:10:14-1:10:20</a>:</strong>  The biggest room for improvement in this is communication, is our ability to communicate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:20">1:10:20-1:10:28</a>:</strong>  to the world at large that this thing works, why it works, that it's, you know what I mean?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:28">1:10:28-1:10:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:29">1:10:29-1:10:30</a>:</strong>  I like it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:30">1:10:30-1:10:31</a>:</strong>  Getting back to the larger audience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:31">1:10:31-1:10:32</a>:</strong>  It's almost always the hardest part.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:32">1:10:32-1:10:33</a>:</strong>  Well, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:33">1:10:33-1:10:38</a>:</strong>  I mean, I can't tell you how many people I still see come to, you know, various forums<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:38">1:10:38-1:10:42</a>:</strong>  here and there and say, look at this cool metal rocket stove I built.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:42">1:10:42-1:10:43</a>:</strong>  I see a lot of those too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:43">1:10:43-1:10:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:44">1:10:44-1:10:45</a>:</strong>  See a lot of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:45">1:10:45-1:10:48</a>:</strong>  And you know, you go, Hey man, that's a really cool thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:48">1:10:48-1:10:53</a>:</strong>  And I love seeing the fire in your little video, but that thing's not going to last,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:53">1:10:53-1:10:56</a>:</strong>  you know, and the comeback on that is, Oh, well you're just a hater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:56">1:10:56-1:10:58</a>:</strong>  You know, it's like, well, no, I love your thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:10:58">1:10:58-1:11:04</a>:</strong>  It looks really cool, but you might want to align the rocket stove interior bits out of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:04">1:11:04-1:11:05</a>:</strong>  refractory material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:05">1:11:05-1:11:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:06">1:11:06-1:11:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:07">1:11:07-1:11:08</a>:</strong>  I mean, I love the longevity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:08">1:11:08-1:11:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:09">1:11:09-1:11:13</a>:</strong>  But I mean, quite often those guys don't come back with a followup YouTube video that says,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:13">1:11:13-1:11:14</a>:</strong>  Oh, wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:14">1:11:14-1:11:18</a>:</strong>  You know, half a half a winter goes by and my heat rises gone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:18">1:11:18-1:11:19</a>:</strong>  Let's try something else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:19">1:11:19-1:11:20</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:20">1:11:20-1:11:21</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:21">1:11:21-1:11:22</a>:</strong>  You know?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:22">1:11:22-1:11:27</a>:</strong>  Um, so I think the improvements in this are all, I don't know, maybe I'm, I'm wrong.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:27">1:11:27-1:11:31</a>:</strong>  I'm sure there's some improvements that could be made somewhere in the physical part of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:31">1:11:31-1:11:32</a>:</strong>  this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:32">1:11:32-1:11:38</a>:</strong>  But I think the biggest improvements I see that need to be made is in that sort of social<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:38">1:11:38-1:11:48</a>:</strong>  sphere, social communication sphere, you know, much potential for production of like a self-contained<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:48">1:11:48-1:11:55</a>:</strong>  unit that you could either have like a, a subcontractor install or a, an owner builder<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:11:55">1:11:55-1:12:02</a>:</strong>  or some DIY person just kind of buy the unit and pretty simply to understand the guts or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:02">1:12:02-1:12:04</a>:</strong>  the interior workings just install for themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:04">1:12:04-1:12:05</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:05">1:12:05-1:12:07</a>:</strong>  There's a group in a, yeah, I think they're Eastern European.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:07">1:12:07-1:12:14</a>:</strong>  I forgot exactly what country, but it's Gamera G A M E R A after the old flying turtle, um,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:14">1:12:14-1:12:15</a>:</strong>  monster movies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:15">1:12:15-1:12:16</a>:</strong>  Oh, okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:16">1:12:16-1:12:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:17">1:12:17-1:12:18</a>:</strong>  Gamera Gamera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:18">1:12:18-1:12:19</a>:</strong>  Anyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:19">1:12:19-1:12:24</a>:</strong>  Um, uh, it's a standalone kit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:24">1:12:24-1:12:25</a>:</strong>  I don't think it's even a kit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:25">1:12:25-1:12:29</a>:</strong>  You just buy the stove, it's set it up and then you could just plug it into your, to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:29">1:12:29-1:12:32</a>:</strong>  your use like thermal mass or hot water or whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:32">1:12:32-1:12:35</a>:</strong>  Uh, it's, that's slick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:35">1:12:35-1:12:36</a>:</strong>  I got to check that out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:36">1:12:36-1:12:37</a>:</strong>  It's really slick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:37">1:12:37-1:12:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:38">1:12:38-1:12:39</a>:</strong>  It's a really cute little thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:39">1:12:39-1:12:43</a>:</strong>  It, it, it just comes out of the box and she stand it up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:43">1:12:43-1:12:46</a>:</strong>  The interior is refractory lined.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:46">1:12:46-1:12:47</a>:</strong>  Mm hmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:47">1:12:47-1:12:51</a>:</strong>  Otherwise it's a metal box or a metal kind of cylinder on legs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:51">1:12:51-1:12:52</a>:</strong>  Gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:52">1:12:52-1:12:56</a>:</strong>  You know, and they've done a little bit of detailing to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:56">1:12:56-1:12:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:12:57">1:12:57-1:13:00</a>:</strong>  They've done some detailing to it, so it's not unattractive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:00">1:13:00-1:13:02</a>:</strong>  Um, it's pretty sweet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:02">1:13:02-1:13:05</a>:</strong>  Little essential for that outreach we're talking about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:05">1:13:05-1:13:06</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:06">1:13:06-1:13:11</a>:</strong>  Uh, and there was another group, um, called, uh, dragon stoves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:11">1:13:11-1:13:12</a>:</strong>  You could find them online.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:12">1:13:12-1:13:16</a>:</strong>  I think they might have sold the business though at this point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:16">1:13:16-1:13:22</a>:</strong>  Uh, they had a cool product, but they were having trouble with, um, yeah, I don't remember<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:22">1:13:22-1:13:25</a>:</strong>  exactly why, what the glitch in their matrix was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:25">1:13:25-1:13:30</a>:</strong>  Um, they came to the forums, actually asked a bunch of questions, built this cool little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:30">1:13:30-1:13:33</a>:</strong>  stove kit that they could send in boxes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:33">1:13:33-1:13:35</a>:</strong>  Uh, they talked to Peter Vandenberg.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:35">1:13:35-1:13:38</a>:</strong>  It was one of the Peter Vandenberg designs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:38">1:13:38-1:13:39</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:39">1:13:39-1:13:44</a>:</strong>  Um, it has, uh, it has a Peter channel built in and some other things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:44">1:13:44-1:13:46</a>:</strong>  Um, it's not a bad little stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:46">1:13:46-1:13:51</a>:</strong>  There's some, some things that I would say need improving, but they sent me a kit, uh,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:51">1:13:51-1:13:52</a>:</strong>  as a thank you gift.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:52">1:13:52-1:13:53</a>:</strong>  Uh, it was cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:53">1:13:53-1:13:59</a>:</strong>  So that's a, yeah, so there's, there's at least two that I know of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:13:59">1:13:59-1:14:04</a>:</strong>  Uh, and I know that there's some other people working on sort of a shippable core idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:04">1:14:04-1:14:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:05">1:14:05-1:14:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:06">1:14:06-1:14:08</a>:</strong>  Um, part to build.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:08">1:14:08-1:14:09</a>:</strong>  Yeah, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:09">1:14:09-1:14:13</a>:</strong>  The hardest part to build something that they could ship in simple pieces that could just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:13">1:14:13-1:14:17</a>:</strong>  be stacked installed and then a barrel thrown on it with, you know, build your own bench<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:17">1:14:17-1:14:18</a>:</strong>  kind of idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:18">1:14:18-1:14:21</a>:</strong>  I think right now the Gamera one is the most mature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:21">1:14:21-1:14:22</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:22">1:14:22-1:14:27</a>:</strong>  Well, I'll do my best to find links to all of this and put this in the resources for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:27">1:14:27-1:14:28</a>:</strong>  the episode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:28">1:14:28-1:14:35</a>:</strong>  Um, and before we wrap up, do you have any advice for DIY folks, uh, listeners to this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:35">1:14:35-1:14:39</a>:</strong>  who want to get started building their first ones and start playing around with the potential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:39">1:14:39-1:14:40</a>:</strong>  of this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:40">1:14:40-1:14:46</a>:</strong>  Well, yeah, I mean at risk of, at risk of repeating myself, um, you know, find a safe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:46">1:14:46-1:14:51</a>:</strong>  place out in your yard or, or in a barn with good ventilation and get started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:51">1:14:51-1:14:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:52">1:14:52-1:14:54</a>:</strong>  Get out there and do it, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:54">1:14:54-1:14:56</a>:</strong>  There's no impediment to just doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:14:56">1:14:56-1:15:01</a>:</strong>  You know, my own experience, like worst case scenario, it's a lot of fun playing with fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:01">1:15:01-1:15:05</a>:</strong>  I mean, maybe that's the worst case scenario, but assuming you're being safe, it's just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:05">1:15:05-1:15:13</a>:</strong>  a lot of fun to play around with how to manipulate these, uh, really base kind of physics, um,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:13">1:15:13-1:15:19</a>:</strong>  of how heat thermodynamics and stuff work with really minimal materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:19">1:15:19-1:15:22</a>:</strong>  Like this is something you could just, uh, I think in our courses, we, we, uh, we, we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:22">1:15:22-1:15:26</a>:</strong>  were throwing these up with a bit of mud and some clay bricks and cheap clay bricks in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:26">1:15:26-1:15:28</a>:</strong>  probably a matter of 20 minutes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:28">1:15:28-1:15:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:29">1:15:29-1:15:31</a>:</strong>  Oh, I mean, yeah, that's about right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:31">1:15:31-1:15:37</a>:</strong>  I mean, really what we have at a rocket stove is it's a Fox stove above ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:37">1:15:37-1:15:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:38">1:15:38-1:15:39</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:39">1:15:39-1:15:41</a>:</strong>  So go back to the history of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:41">1:15:41-1:15:48</a>:</strong>  Look at Fox stoves, build one, look at, um, you know, uh, look at the old tin cans stove,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:48">1:15:48-1:15:52</a>:</strong>  build a couple, you know, as a test, you can just use metal stove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:52">1:15:52-1:15:57</a>:</strong>  Pipe and cobble fabric, cobble, some garbage together and get a cool stove that will not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:57">1:15:57-1:15:59</a>:</strong>  last, but it's fun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:15:59">1:15:59-1:16:00</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:00">1:16:00-1:16:05</a>:</strong>  And you can, you can iterate changes really quickly with something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:05">1:16:05-1:16:06</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:06">1:16:06-1:16:09</a>:</strong>  That's where you get to really experiment around and try new stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:09">1:16:09-1:16:10</a>:</strong>  Absolutely try new stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:10">1:16:10-1:16:11</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:11">1:16:11-1:16:16</a>:</strong>  And, and of course go and look at the things that other people have done on the forums<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:16">1:16:16-1:16:20</a>:</strong>  and, and all of that stuff, but don't be afraid to try things that other people think are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:20">1:16:20-1:16:25</a>:</strong>  dumb, you know, like I can only screw up so many ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:25">1:16:25-1:16:28</a>:</strong>  I can only think of so many ways to screw up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:28">1:16:28-1:16:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:29">1:16:29-1:16:33</a>:</strong>  And I've done my best learning by screwing up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:33">1:16:33-1:16:42</a>:</strong>  So everybody find a way to screw up in a way that nobody else has figured out how to do,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:42">1:16:42-1:16:45</a>:</strong>  because that's going to teach you something about building a better stove next time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:45">1:16:45-1:16:46</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:46">1:16:46-1:16:52</a>:</strong>  And of course, make it safe for yourself, your family, your neighbors, do your best<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:52">1:16:52-1:16:59</a>:</strong>  to be safe, but don't be afraid of experimenting and doing, you know, quote unquote dumb things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:16:59">1:16:59-1:17:00</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:00">1:17:00-1:17:02</a>:</strong>  You know, because that's how we all got started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:02">1:17:02-1:17:04</a>:</strong>  We were told this wasn't possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:04">1:17:04-1:17:05</a>:</strong>  We were told we were doing stupid things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:05">1:17:05-1:17:07</a>:</strong>  I was hippies over there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:07">1:17:07-1:17:09</a>:</strong>  They're going to kill themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:09">1:17:09-1:17:14</a>:</strong>  Well, you know, not yet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:14">1:17:14-1:17:18</a>:</strong>  But we did some great things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:18">1:17:18-1:17:21</a>:</strong>  That's not really the best gotcha I've heard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:21">1:17:21-1:17:29</a>:</strong>  We haven't heard that one yet, but I'm totally in this camp, so I'm in favor of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:29">1:17:29-1:17:30</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:30">1:17:30-1:17:34</a>:</strong>  You know, the point being is that we created something really cool that people said that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:34">1:17:34-1:17:37</a>:</strong>  couldn't be done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:37">1:17:37-1:17:40</a>:</strong>  And we did it because we were willing to do dumb things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:40">1:17:40-1:17:41</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:41">1:17:41-1:17:42</a>:</strong>  Quote, unquote.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:42">1:17:42-1:17:43</a>:</strong>  I'm doing air quotes here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:43">1:17:43-1:17:44</a>:</strong>  You can't see it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:44">1:17:44-1:17:48</a>:</strong>  I know that's obnoxious, but, you know, dumb things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:48">1:17:48-1:17:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:49">1:17:49-1:17:51</a>:</strong>  And thinking outside of the box.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:51">1:17:51-1:17:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:52">1:17:52-1:17:56</a>:</strong>  You know, and that's one of the great things about rocket stoves is that you have this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:17:56">1:17:56-1:18:02</a>:</strong>  combustion unit that is also separate from the use of the heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:02">1:18:02-1:18:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:03">1:18:03-1:18:07</a>:</strong>  So, you know, once you build a combustion unit that you really like, now you can play<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:07">1:18:07-1:18:10</a>:</strong>  downstream with different ways of using the heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:10">1:18:10-1:18:16</a>:</strong>  Oh, yeah, the implications are almost limitless once you get, you know, the basics down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:16">1:18:16-1:18:17</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:17">1:18:17-1:18:18</a>:</strong>  And one of the things that we've-<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:18">1:18:18-1:18:22</a>:</strong>  The crazy and dumb ideas we were talking about earlier, like hooking up a sauna to it, like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:22">1:18:22-1:18:24</a>:</strong>  figuring out if it works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:24">1:18:24-1:18:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah, totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:25">1:18:25-1:18:32</a>:</strong>  Well, as a general rule, I mean, here's something that hasn't gotten a lot of time and experimentation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:32">1:18:32-1:18:33</a>:</strong>  with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:33">1:18:33-1:18:38</a>:</strong>  You know, when you have it, when you build a stove to do more than one thing at a time,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:38">1:18:38-1:18:41</a>:</strong>  they tend not to do any one of them well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:41">1:18:41-1:18:42</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:42">1:18:42-1:18:43</a>:</strong>  But that isn't necessary.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:43">1:18:43-1:18:48</a>:</strong>  That doesn't have to be true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:48">1:18:48-1:18:53</a>:</strong>  Maybe with things like bypasses, you know, which is basically a valve in the downstream,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:53">1:18:53-1:18:58</a>:</strong>  in the stream, so that you can flip it one way and the airflow, the gas flow goes one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:58">1:18:58-1:18:59</a>:</strong>  direction into, say, a hot water heater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:18:59">1:18:59-1:19:00</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:00">1:19:00-1:19:03</a>:</strong>  And then you flip it the other way and then the gas flow can maybe go into a heat storage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:03">1:19:03-1:19:04</a>:</strong>  device for your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:04">1:19:04-1:19:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:05">1:19:05-1:19:09</a>:</strong>  You know, and then on that, you can flip it another way and it goes into your sauna.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:09">1:19:09-1:19:14</a>:</strong>  You know, also there's different needs and different uses of heat, like cooking tends<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:14">1:19:14-1:19:18</a>:</strong>  to want a higher temperature and say heating your house tends to want to have a lower temperature<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:18">1:19:18-1:19:23</a>:</strong>  and maybe you can take uses off of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:23">1:19:23-1:19:29</a>:</strong>  You know, there's a lot of room for innovation in how to use the heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:29">1:19:29-1:19:30</a>:</strong>  Mm-hmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:30">1:19:30-1:19:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and figure out what you can find out from your home experiments and post them on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:35">1:19:35-1:19:36</a>:</strong>  the forums.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-kirk-donkey-mobert/#t=1:19:36">1:19:36-1:19:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
