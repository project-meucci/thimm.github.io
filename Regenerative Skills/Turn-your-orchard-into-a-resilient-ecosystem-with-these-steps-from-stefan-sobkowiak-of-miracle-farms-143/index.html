<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:08">0:01:08-0:01:09</a>:</strong>  That's my little niece Selma.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:09">0:01:09-0:01:12</a>:</strong>  She just turned four and was very excited to hear her voice recorded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:12">0:01:12-0:01:17</a>:</strong>  And so I'm on a little family vacation here just before Christmas with my sister and her<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:37">0:01:37-0:01:42</a>:</strong>  We've covered so many different ways to approach reforestation, both with native species and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:42">0:01:42-0:01:45</a>:</strong>  mixes of natives and orchard trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:45">0:01:45-0:01:49</a>:</strong>  In today's session, Oliver wanted to focus on fruit orchards, and he got to speak with<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:55">0:01:55-0:01:59</a>:</strong>  Oliver has been a fan of Stefan's work for a while, and he spent a lot of time on his<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:01:59">0:01:59-0:02:04</a>:</strong>  excellent YouTube channel, where he offers tons of tutorials and solutions to practical<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:09">0:02:09-0:02:14</a>:</strong>  In this interview, we break it all down from the beginning, from how Stefan began to look<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:14">0:02:14-0:02:18</a>:</strong>  for land and the challenging climate of Canada, all through his great advice for how to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:18">0:02:18-0:02:25</a>:</strong>  started from selecting species, building soil, propagating trees, and growing from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:25">0:02:25-0:02:31</a>:</strong>  We also go into how Stefan leverages nature's tools to create a healthy and balanced ecosystem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:31">0:02:31-0:02:36</a>:</strong>  that not only brings more resilience to the operation, but helps to reduce labor and external<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:36">0:02:36-0:02:37</a>:</strong>  inputs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:37">0:02:37-0:02:42</a>:</strong>  Towards the end, we also unpack some invaluable advice on how to make money through innovative<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:47">0:02:47-0:02:50</a>:</strong>  We cover a really wide range of topics, and Stefan really knows his stuff, so don't forget<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:54">0:02:54-0:02:56</a>:</strong>  around for good measure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:02:56">0:02:56-0:02:57</a>:</strong>  Now let's hand things over to Stefan.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:12">0:03:12-0:03:16</a>:</strong>  the Permaculture Orchard, which you walk through all of your systems on Miracle Farms, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:16">0:03:16-0:03:20</a>:</strong>  I've got tons of questions, as well explained as everything was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:20">0:03:20-0:03:24</a>:</strong>  So let's start from the beginning and have you tell us a little bit about your personal<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:34">0:03:34-0:03:45</a>:</strong>  I studied wildlife biology, and then I did a masters in landscape architecture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:45">0:03:45-0:03:51</a>:</strong>  Fortunately in 1990, discovered Bill Malsen's book, The Designer's Manual, devoured it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:51">0:03:51-0:03:53</a>:</strong>  for three weeks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:53">0:03:53-0:03:56</a>:</strong>  Got so excited, I realized I had to get started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:04:01</a>:</strong>  I had to get planted, I had to get going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:06</a>:</strong>  Started to look for a place, because we were living in the city, where we still do, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:06">0:04:06-0:04:09</a>:</strong>  we were looking for a place to start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:09">0:04:09-0:04:16</a>:</strong>  And found a little farm after two years of search, so if anybody's ever thinking, oh<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:16">0:04:16-0:04:21</a>:</strong>  yeah, good, I want to get started, it doesn't always happen overnight, so I understand how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:21">0:04:21-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  sometimes delays.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:24">0:04:24-0:04:32</a>:</strong>  So I bought this 4000 tree monoculture conventional apple orchard that we transitioned to organic,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:32">0:04:32-0:04:40</a>:</strong>  did that for five years, and really came to the conclusion that it wasn't an active and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:40">0:04:40-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  viable ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:04:49</a>:</strong>  It still was a monoculture, I had to admit that yeah, at that point I had 3000 trees,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:49">0:04:49-0:04:56</a>:</strong>  because there's a learning curve, so losing 25% of the trees is just par for the course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:04:56">0:04:56-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  And got started, got going, and by then I was already teaching in PDCs, and I realized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:11</a>:</strong>  I was a little bit of a hypocrite, because I would teach people how to set up a permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:11">0:05:11-0:05:12</a>:</strong>  orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:12">0:05:12-0:05:17</a>:</strong>  I would come into my monoculture organic orchard, and I thought, geez, this isn't exactly what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:17">0:05:17-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  I'm teaching.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:19">0:05:19-0:05:26</a>:</strong>  So it took a few years, we set up a nursery and replanted the orchard, and then to at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:26">0:05:26-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  least be able to say that what I'm teaching is what I'm doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:31">0:05:31-0:05:35</a>:</strong>  So that's kind of where we got to in a nutshell.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:35">0:05:35-0:05:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I think that's a situation that a lot of people can relate to, in that they want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  to get started real fast, it ends up taking longer than they thought, and in the beginning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:49</a>:</strong>  they kind of have to make some compromises from what their ideals are, and kind of balance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:49">0:05:49-0:05:52</a>:</strong>  things out until they're able to go all in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:52">0:05:52-0:05:56</a>:</strong>  Now how many acres is Miracle Farms on?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:05:56">0:05:56-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  We're on 12 acres, of which we have about 5, 6 acres planted now, or replanted in a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:04</a>:</strong>  permaculture orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:04">0:06:04-0:06:13</a>:</strong>  We still have about an acre in somewhat monoculture, but gradually transitioning orchards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:13">0:06:13-0:06:19</a>:</strong>  And so, though you were organic from the beginning, that monoculture put it in contrast to what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:19">0:06:19-0:06:20</a>:</strong>  you were aiming to achieve.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:20">0:06:20-0:06:26</a>:</strong>  How would you define the difference between a permaculture orchard and how it's different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:26">0:06:26-0:06:28</a>:</strong>  from a conventional one?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:28">0:06:28-0:06:31</a>:</strong>  Diversity, that's the main thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:31">0:06:31-0:06:37</a>:</strong>  We had before, it would be the same species, so it would be all, in our case it was an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:37">0:06:37-0:06:41</a>:</strong>  apple orchard, but the same thing for pear or plum or peach orchard, whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:45</a>:</strong>  It's always planted as a monoculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:45">0:06:45-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  That's the whole ideal of an orchard nowadays, when we say, oh I have an orchard, well you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:53</a>:</strong>  have usually an orchard made up of the same tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:53">0:06:53-0:06:59</a>:</strong>  So the big difference is, we don't have a monoculture to the point where we don't even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:06:59">0:06:59-0:07:03</a>:</strong>  have the same species touching two trees in a row.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:03">0:07:03-0:07:04</a>:</strong>  At least that's the goal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:04">0:07:04-0:07:10</a>:</strong>  We might have a few examples where two trees of the same species touch, but that's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:10">0:07:10-0:07:13</a>:</strong>  by design, it just happens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:13">0:07:13-0:07:21</a>:</strong>  So the idea is that we really want there to be diversity within the row and between rows,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:21">0:07:21-0:07:24</a>:</strong>  so that's the big difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:24">0:07:24-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  And we function in a system of trios, so we'll put a nitrogen fixer, which is completely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:34</a>:</strong>  different from fruit trees, it's a totally different family.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:34">0:07:34-0:07:39</a>:</strong>  And then we'll put either two fruit trees, a fruit tree and a nut tree, or two nut trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:39">0:07:39-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  So that's the basis of trios, and it's quite a departure from the monoculture apple orchard<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  that we had.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:55</a>:</strong>  I would never go back to a monoculture, I may as well just quit, because I've been there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:55">0:07:55-0:07:57</a>:</strong>  and I definitely don't want to go back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:07:57">0:07:57-0:08:03</a>:</strong>  When I hear Mollison in his writings and in his talkings, he says, if you're ever so unfortunate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:03">0:08:03-0:08:09</a>:</strong>  as to inherit a monoculture orchard, and I get it totally, because it is a misfortunes,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:09">0:08:09-0:08:14</a>:</strong>  it's, you think, oh, that's great, you know, well, it's not so great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:14">0:08:14-0:08:20</a>:</strong>  You're better off inheriting a piece of open land than to inherit an existing monoculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:20">0:08:20-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:28</a>:</strong>  Because it's far, well, it's far easier to start from scratch, than to undo what's there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:31</a>:</strong>  to redo what you would like.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:31">0:08:31-0:08:35</a>:</strong>  It's just, it's not as obvious to think, well, I'll just cut some trees down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:35">0:08:35-0:08:37</a>:</strong>  Well, the tree doesn't want to just die.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:37">0:08:37-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  Even if you cut it down, you would have to cut it and yank your roots out for that tree<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:45</a>:</strong>  to no longer be an apple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:45">0:08:45-0:08:52</a>:</strong>  And then you have, basically, you know, you'll have trees that are high and others that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:52">0:08:52-0:08:53</a>:</strong>  small.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:08:53">0:08:53-0:09:00</a>:</strong>  So it's harder to restart that way than it is to start from scratch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:00">0:09:00-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  Having done it, I know that, yeah, it's a lot of work to take out an existing orchard<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:08</a>:</strong>  and then replant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:08">0:09:08-0:09:12</a>:</strong>  And so it's taken you how long to make this transition to where you are now and how much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:12">0:09:12-0:09:16</a>:</strong>  longer do you think until you reach the goal that you set for yourself?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:16">0:09:16-0:09:21</a>:</strong>  Well, we've been, we replanted the first block in 2007.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:21">0:09:21-0:09:24</a>:</strong>  So it's going to be 12 years this year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:32</a>:</strong>  And then we replanted 2008, 2009, 2013, 14.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:32">0:09:32-0:09:37</a>:</strong>  We've been replanting kind of every year since in a smaller capacity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:37">0:09:37-0:09:42</a>:</strong>  This year, we just put in a block totally departing from the whole idea of planting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:42">0:09:42-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  an orchard where we seeded an orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:45">0:09:45-0:09:50</a>:</strong>  So that's getting into experimenting and trying new things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:50">0:09:50-0:09:53</a>:</strong>  But it, yeah, it took a few years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:53">0:09:53-0:09:57</a>:</strong>  The orchards, most of the orchard blocks are in full production.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:09:57">0:09:57-0:10:02</a>:</strong>  So that's very nice that now it's really cranking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:02">0:10:02-0:10:05</a>:</strong>  But it takes a few years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:05">0:10:05-0:10:07</a>:</strong>  Orchards are not planting a radish crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:07">0:10:07-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  And I always remind people, you know, you're maybe used to planting vegetables and it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:14</a>:</strong>  30 days and 60 days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:14">0:10:14-0:10:17</a>:</strong>  Well, this is more like three years to six years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:17">0:10:17-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  So it's a very different timescale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:22</a>:</strong>  It'll take a lot more patience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:22">0:10:22-0:10:30</a>:</strong>  It'll take a lot more financial backing because you're going to have to, till you start having<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:30">0:10:30-0:10:34</a>:</strong>  money coming in, it will be money going out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:34">0:10:34-0:10:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's something that we've covered so many times in previous episodes on this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:38">0:10:38-0:10:43</a>:</strong>  podcast is how to make that transition into a perennial system, especially one that matures<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:48</a>:</strong>  kind of late and how to manage the finances and the diversity and work in the efficiency<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:48">0:10:48-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  of the model to make sure that it pays back as an investment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:57</a>:</strong>  Let's keep going with the beginning because you said that you were starting to teach permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:10:57">0:10:57-0:11:00</a>:</strong>  even before you started to transition the orchard yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:00">0:11:00-0:11:04</a>:</strong>  Can you talk a little bit about how people can get started designing an orchard that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:04">0:11:04-0:11:09</a>:</strong>  creates a resilient ecosystem with as little inputs as possible as you defined your goals<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:09">0:11:09-0:11:11</a>:</strong>  in the film?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:11">0:11:11-0:11:15</a>:</strong>  What are some of the most important things to consider?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:15">0:11:15-0:11:17</a>:</strong>  I like to say just start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:17">0:11:17-0:11:25</a>:</strong>  That's really a mantra that I like to push because if you think, well, I don't have this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:25">0:11:25-0:11:31</a>:</strong>  and I don't have that and I don't have the land and I don't have, and you put all kinds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:31">0:11:31-0:11:38</a>:</strong>  of reasons why you can't while just focus on, I say, start with two trios.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:38">0:11:38-0:11:44</a>:</strong>  You say, well, I'm living in a suburb or I'm living in the city and I don't have much room.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  Do you have room for six trees and it may be just six shrubs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:51</a>:</strong>  You can do trios with shrubs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:51">0:11:51-0:11:58</a>:</strong>  And so just start, get some trees in, get two trios because two trios work really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:11:58">0:11:58-0:12:04</a>:</strong>  If you just put in three trees, then none of the trees may have the ability to get pollinated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:04">0:12:04-0:12:06</a>:</strong>  and therefore you'll think, well, it doesn't produce.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:06">0:12:06-0:12:11</a>:</strong>  Well, it doesn't produce because you only have one of each of the trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:11">0:12:11-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  So two trios guarantees that you'll have, well, it doesn't guarantee, but it makes it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:15">0:12:15-0:12:20</a>:</strong>  far more likely that you'll have good pollination and you'll have a good start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:20">0:12:20-0:12:26</a>:</strong>  And you'll learn just as much with two trios as you would with 200 trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:26">0:12:26-0:12:31</a>:</strong>  So that's the key is if you can start, and those of you who are listening who are further<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:31">0:12:31-0:12:34</a>:</strong>  south, you still have a planting season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:34">0:12:34-0:12:40</a>:</strong>  You may still be able to plant where the ground is totally frozen here and this planting season<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:40">0:12:40-0:12:47</a>:</strong>  is well over, but if you can start this fall, even this weekend, go out and just put in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:47">0:12:47-0:12:53</a>:</strong>  six trees, start with that and then gradually you'll diversify, add a couple of shrubs for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:53">0:12:53-0:12:55</a>:</strong>  each tree and fruiting shrubs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:55">0:12:55-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  So you'll have your collection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:13:03</a>:</strong>  And what I like to say is if you start that way, now that's not a huge investment, putting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:03">0:13:03-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  in six trees and let's say 12 shrubs and company that by some perennials, you may put<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:11</a>:</strong>  in for $500.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:11">0:13:11-0:13:14</a>:</strong>  You say, well, you know, that's a lot of money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:14">0:13:14-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  Well, $500 is really not a lot of money compared to putting in an orchard of a few hundred<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:22</a>:</strong>  trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:22">0:13:22-0:13:29</a>:</strong>  But when you have these six trees going and the shrubs underneath and some perennials<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:29">0:13:29-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  in two years, the plants that really are happy, and I like to say happy because a plant that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:37</a>:</strong>  happy will double every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:37">0:13:37-0:13:44</a>:</strong>  So in two years, you will probably get to a point where you can multiply your existing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:44">0:13:44-0:13:47</a>:</strong>  plants by 10.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:48</a>:</strong>  That's where it gets interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:48">0:13:48-0:13:49</a>:</strong>  You say, well, I don't know how to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:49">0:13:49-0:13:54</a>:</strong>  Well, in two years you will have plenty of time to learn how.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:54">0:13:54-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  And so you'll be able to do some propagation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:00</a>:</strong>  You'll be able to learn about taking cuttings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:00">0:14:00-0:14:05</a>:</strong>  If you check out my YouTube channel, I got some nice little videos on propagating shrubs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:05">0:14:05-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  and a couple of easy techniques.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:15</a>:</strong>  And so those are ways that you can get started very relatively inexpensive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:15">0:14:15-0:14:20</a>:</strong>  And then if you say, well, it'll give you the opportunity to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:20">0:14:20-0:14:23</a>:</strong>  So if you say, well, I only put in two trios.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:23">0:14:23-0:14:25</a>:</strong>  Well, what's 10 times that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:25">0:14:25-0:14:28</a>:</strong>  That's 12 trios.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:28">0:14:28-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  And then from there, so 12 trios times six, you're up to 72 trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  And then you can grow by another 10 times in another two years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  So it's that kind of multiplication.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:40">0:14:40-0:14:44</a>:</strong>  You say, well, all I have room for is six trees and that's where I want to stay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:44">0:14:44-0:14:45</a>:</strong>  Well, great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:45">0:14:45-0:14:54</a>:</strong>  Then you can get started and have your yard producing in just a few years with two trios.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:54">0:14:54-0:14:57</a>:</strong>  So it's really that whole issue of starting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:14:57">0:14:57-0:15:03</a>:</strong>  And I know, I mean, I'm talking to you about it, but I know because I had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:03">0:15:03-0:15:09</a>:</strong>  the dream and the idea of doing it, but I had this monoculture orchard and it really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:09">0:15:09-0:15:15</a>:</strong>  kept me for quite a few years from starting to replant the orchard the way I wanted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:15">0:15:15-0:15:21</a>:</strong>  So just start, I should have started years ago with a lot less rather than trying to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:21">0:15:21-0:15:23</a>:</strong>  put in right away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:23">0:15:23-0:15:30</a>:</strong>  We put in one acre and then we put in two and three and a half acres.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:30">0:15:30-0:15:37</a>:</strong>  So it's a lot more to think in that scale while you could start much smaller.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:37">0:15:37-0:15:43</a>:</strong>  And then you'll, at least if you start, you'll have the fruit that much earlier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:43">0:15:43-0:15:49</a>:</strong>  And it's the time element that's really critical because the longer you delay, the longer you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:49">0:15:49-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  won't get to taste the fruit of your work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:15:54</a>:</strong>  And that's where the change really happens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:15:54">0:15:54-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  When you start to harvest, then you start to go, oh my gosh, the first year we harvested<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:02</a>:</strong>  a few sweet cherries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:02">0:16:02-0:16:07</a>:</strong>  I thought, why didn't I put in 50?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:07">0:16:07-0:16:10</a>:</strong>  Because it takes a few years for them to produce.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:10">0:16:10-0:16:15</a>:</strong>  And then when they did, I thought, wow, one tree, the birds come in, I eat everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:15">0:16:15-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  So that's another issue.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:20</a>:</strong>  But yeah, I thought I should have put in more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:20">0:16:20-0:16:22</a>:</strong>  And so, okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:22">0:16:22-0:16:27</a>:</strong>  But at least I learned with that one and now I'm planning to put in more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:27">0:16:27-0:16:29</a>:</strong>  But that's the progression.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:29">0:16:29-0:16:32</a>:</strong>  Just start is so important to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:32">0:16:32-0:16:35</a>:</strong>  But I really love that advice and that methodology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:35">0:16:35-0:16:39</a>:</strong>  I really have echoed that in some of the things that I've taught through my own courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:39">0:16:39-0:16:43</a>:</strong>  And it applies to many other things than just ecosystems as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:43">0:16:43-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  Like I talk about starting with very small projects in natural building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:51</a>:</strong>  And it's a great way of working out some of the difficulties, the learning curve, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:51">0:16:51-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  the mistakes that you're going to do on smaller projects with less risk and a lot less to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:17:00</a>:</strong>  lose if you get it wrong or if you make some larger mistakes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:00">0:17:00-0:17:04</a>:</strong>  And like you said, especially with these projects taking longer with the successional models<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:04">0:17:04-0:17:10</a>:</strong>  of perennial plants, not only will it make it much cheaper to propagate and grow your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:10">0:17:10-0:17:14</a>:</strong>  orchard down the line, but it'll give you the time to learn those skills and make some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:14">0:17:14-0:17:21</a>:</strong>  of those adjustments as you learn them rather than making a big initial investment and running<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:21">0:17:21-0:17:26</a>:</strong>  the risk of it failing because you're new to the whole system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:26">0:17:26-0:17:30</a>:</strong>  And if it fails, it's not as big of a financial hit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:30">0:17:30-0:17:31</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:31">0:17:31-0:17:36</a>:</strong>  I guess for you, you're talking something like use the opportunity to build a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:36">0:17:36-0:17:40</a>:</strong>  shed, which you don't need the different permitting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:40">0:17:40-0:17:42</a>:</strong>  Most places they'll allow you to put in a shed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:42">0:17:42-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  So if you build a little 8 by 10 shed, well, you don't need permits for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:55</a>:</strong>  And you can practice building with whatever, clay, mud, the mud brick or a straw bale or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:55">0:17:55-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  whatever technique, but you've practiced it and you're, you're getting going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:02</a>:</strong>  And it's the same thing, just a different scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:02">0:18:02-0:18:07</a>:</strong>  When you go to say, well, now I want to build a house that's a 30 by 30.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:07">0:18:07-0:18:09</a>:</strong>  Well, it's not the corners.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:09">0:18:09-0:18:10</a>:</strong>  It's the same detail.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:10">0:18:10-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  The wall, it's the same detail.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:15</a>:</strong>  The work around the door, it's the same detail.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:15">0:18:15-0:18:16</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:16">0:18:16-0:18:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:22</a>:</strong>  And a lot of people find out in the first project that they either do or do not even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:22">0:18:22-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  really like what they set out to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:28</a>:</strong>  You know, it's, it's just something you've got to figure out, like you said, by, by jumping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:28">0:18:28-0:18:30</a>:</strong>  into it and just getting started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:30">0:18:30-0:18:36</a>:</strong>  Now, I would even back up one more and say, if you see somebody asking for help and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:36">0:18:36-0:18:41</a>:</strong>  want to do a building, jump in on their project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:41">0:18:41-0:18:46</a>:</strong>  Because as you say, rather than getting through all of that and getting set up to start building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:46">0:18:46-0:18:50</a>:</strong>  a shed in the back, in your backyard, maybe if you're helping somebody on theirs and you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:50">0:18:50-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  go, Oh, this isn't exactly what I want to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:55</a>:</strong>  Well, that's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:55">0:18:55-0:18:59</a>:</strong>  You've learned that you don't even want to embark on maybe that technique.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:18:59">0:18:59-0:19:03</a>:</strong>  So then jump on another project and, and people can learn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:03">0:19:03-0:19:07</a>:</strong>  You don't have to do it all in your place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:07">0:19:07-0:19:11</a>:</strong>  You can help other people and you'll learn, you'll do the process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:11">0:19:11-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  Especially because you're likely to be working with people with more experience that can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  help give you advice that you might not even have come to on your own just for not having<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:21</a>:</strong>  thought through that process for as long as they have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:21">0:19:21-0:19:24</a>:</strong>  I mean, I've been very fortunate that that's mostly how I learned this stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:24">0:19:24-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  I went to school for totally different things, but I traveled around all over the world,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:32</a>:</strong>  just helping people on their projects and, you know, slowly but surely building a skill<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:32">0:19:32-0:19:38</a>:</strong>  set into these that, that kind of helped me advance without having to take on all of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:38">0:19:38-0:19:41</a>:</strong>  risk and the upfront cost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:41">0:19:41-0:19:42</a>:</strong>  Where are you based, Oliver?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:42">0:19:42-0:19:43</a>:</strong>  So let's get back to the topic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:43">0:19:43-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  Hold on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:45</a>:</strong>  I'm from Minnesota right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:45">0:19:45-0:19:46</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:46">0:19:46-0:19:47</a>:</strong>  Right now I'm in Kuwait.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:47">0:19:47-0:19:49</a>:</strong>  But I'm just visiting family.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:49">0:19:49-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  I am based in Spain, though I'm from Minnesota and I did most of this work and, and really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:57</a>:</strong>  worked on my first farm in Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:19:57">0:19:57-0:20:01</a>:</strong>  So it's, it's been a huge mess of locations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:01">0:20:01-0:20:06</a>:</strong>  So just in Spain, are you working or do you have a project planned in the next six months?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:06">0:20:06-0:20:07</a>:</strong>  You have a build there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:07">0:20:07-0:20:12</a>:</strong>  So now that I have transitioned away from the farm that I had in Guatemala, I am in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:12">0:20:12-0:20:14</a>:</strong>  the stage of looking for land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:14">0:20:14-0:20:19</a>:</strong>  And there's actually a couple of places that my partner and I are looking into more closely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:19">0:20:19-0:20:21</a>:</strong>  And it's one of the reasons why I'm talking to you now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:21">0:20:21-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  And I've looked into so many of the resources that you've put out is because starting up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:31</a>:</strong>  an orchard is one of the things that I think might be most viable for us on a small acreage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:31">0:20:31-0:20:35</a>:</strong>  and having it integrate with a couple of other enterprises on a small farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:35">0:20:35-0:20:36</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:36">0:20:36-0:20:42</a>:</strong>  And so here, let's, let's jump back a little bit now to some of your methodology and how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:42">0:20:42-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  you develop your companion plant polycultures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  I really love your NAP system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  And could you, first of all, explain a little bit of the NAP methodology and do you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:21:00</a>:</strong>  to wait years to see what grows well together or can you make some educated guesses that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:00">0:21:00-0:21:02</a>:</strong>  speed up that process?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:02">0:21:02-0:21:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah, first of all, I don't use the NAP anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:07">0:21:07-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  Really, you've transitioned away from that one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:16</a>:</strong>  Well, I use what I call trios simply because the NAP kind of locked people in the NAP was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:16">0:21:16-0:21:20</a>:</strong>  NAP and N was the symbol for a nitrogen fixer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:20">0:21:20-0:21:22</a>:</strong>  So that's fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:22">0:21:22-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  And then I would say, AP was apple pear or apple plum.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  Well, that's fine if you're in my type of climate, but if you're in Kuwait, NAP doesn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:33</a>:</strong>  work at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:33">0:21:33-0:21:36</a>:</strong>  And that you say, well, apples don't grow here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:36">0:21:36-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  So now I just keep it as trios and people can understand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:41</a>:</strong>  Trio, okay, what's a trio?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:41">0:21:41-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  Well, one is a nitrogen fixer and then use two fruit trees or a fruit tree and a nut<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  or two nuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:53</a>:</strong>  So that's the definition really of my trios now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:53">0:21:53-0:21:58</a>:</strong>  But it's important that those two that aren't the nitrogen fixers not be the same species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:21:58">0:21:58-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  Right, right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:11</a>:</strong>  So that's the basis of trios and yeah, I would say your second part is my understanding and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:11">0:22:11-0:22:16</a>:</strong>  observation of it is that most plants really want to cooperate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:16">0:22:16-0:22:21</a>:</strong>  There are very few examples where the plants really don't work well together and it took<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:21">0:22:21-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  10 years to see that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  And the example was in Mollison's book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:33</a>:</strong>  And I saw that and I thought, yeah, but you know, I thought, well, you know, if a tree<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:40</a>:</strong>  is stressed and this is what I did learn is that when a tree is not stressed, it doesn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:40">0:22:40-0:22:42</a>:</strong>  need its defense system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:42">0:22:42-0:22:44</a>:</strong>  Now what's a defense?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:44">0:22:44-0:22:45</a>:</strong>  An example used with walnuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:45">0:22:45-0:22:46</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:46">0:22:46-0:22:50</a>:</strong>  So Mollison talked about walnuts doesn't go well with apples.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:50">0:22:50-0:22:55</a>:</strong>  And I thought, well, you know, I've had my trees for nine years and they're doing fine<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:55">0:22:55-0:22:57</a>:</strong>  and they're next to each other and there's no problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:22:57">0:22:57-0:23:04</a>:</strong>  Well, when the walnut tree really started to produce, now it's a totally different tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:04">0:23:04-0:23:07</a>:</strong>  It's no longer the juvenile that all it's looking to do is grow wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:07">0:23:07-0:23:10</a>:</strong>  Now it has to put out nuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:10">0:23:10-0:23:15</a>:</strong>  So when the walnut really began and it had begun a few years earlier with a few nuts,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:22</a>:</strong>  but when it really started to produce nuts en masse, then it no longer wanted the apple<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:22">0:23:22-0:23:28</a>:</strong>  next to it and every walnut that was next to an apple tree killed the apple tree that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:28">0:23:28-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  was right next to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:34</a>:</strong>  And that, that extended up to about 50 feet away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:34">0:23:34-0:23:39</a>:</strong>  So the roots are quite far out and they will affect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:39">0:23:39-0:23:45</a>:</strong>  So if I had, for example, a walnut as the nut tree and then apple and then a nitrogen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:45">0:23:45-0:23:50</a>:</strong>  fixer, and then I would have two fruit trees and a nitrogen fixer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:50">0:23:50-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  If in the second trio, if you can imagine there's a first trio and a second trio, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:24:00</a>:</strong>  apple in the first trio would be killed, but the apple in the second trio so far hasn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:00">0:24:00-0:24:01</a>:</strong>  been affected.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:01">0:24:01-0:24:09</a>:</strong>  So there is a distance element that is important because basically the walnut won't go through,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:09">0:24:09-0:24:13</a>:</strong>  let's say five other trees to get to the roots of the second apple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:13">0:24:13-0:24:14</a>:</strong>  That's too far.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:14">0:24:14-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  And so it did, it did kill all the apple trees and it happened really quite quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:19">0:24:19-0:24:24</a>:</strong>  I was surprised within two years, first you'd see, well, this tree is starting to look a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:24">0:24:24-0:24:28</a>:</strong>  little affected, like the leaf color would change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:28">0:24:28-0:24:34</a>:</strong>  And well, by the end of the second year, every one of them were completely dead dry, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:34">0:24:34-0:24:36</a>:</strong>  know, firewood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:36">0:24:36-0:24:41</a>:</strong>  So that is the only example that I have observed of them not getting along.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:41">0:24:41-0:24:47</a>:</strong>  Now I don't know for all climates and all the different species, cause I know that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:47">0:24:47-0:24:52</a>:</strong>  you know, I just came back from a tour of Europe and in France, especially the South<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:52">0:24:52-0:24:56</a>:</strong>  of France, the range of fruit trees that you can grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:56">0:24:56-0:24:57</a>:</strong>  Wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:24:57">0:24:57-0:25:01</a>:</strong>  It's like, man, or the Southern US, you can grow so many different fruit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:01">0:25:01-0:25:06</a>:</strong>  I mean, we've got apple, pear, plum, and limited cherries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:06">0:25:06-0:25:07</a>:</strong>  That's our fruit range.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:07">0:25:07-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  You say, well, no, apricots don't grow well here in the flatlands anyway, in the mountains<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  they may.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:21</a>:</strong>  And so you're really limited in the range while they're talking much more diversity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:21">0:25:21-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  So I don't know with all the different combinations, but overall I have seen that plants do well<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:30</a>:</strong>  together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:31</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:31">0:25:31-0:25:32</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:32">0:25:32-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  I mean, those are just variables that you have to start to discover when you get to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  know your place and your context much better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:39">0:25:39-0:25:45</a>:</strong>  It's impossible for someone to learn that for the whole world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:45">0:25:45-0:25:50</a>:</strong>  Let's talk about some of the other methods that you use to reduce the maintenance and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:50">0:25:50-0:25:54</a>:</strong>  the extra work that you would have to do to take care of these trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:54">0:25:54-0:25:59</a>:</strong>  I know you have sort of a controversial method of managing weeds, though I've heard your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:25:59">0:25:59-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  defense of plastic mulch and I understand it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:02">0:26:02-0:26:04</a>:</strong>  Could you explain it a little to our listeners?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:04">0:26:04-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:09</a>:</strong>  So I mean, I never set out to put out plastic mulch in the orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:09">0:26:09-0:26:11</a>:</strong>  That wasn't the original intent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:11">0:26:11-0:26:20</a>:</strong>  We did start with wood chips, the rameo branch fragments, which is chipped small branches.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:20">0:26:20-0:26:26</a>:</strong>  The idea was that you put in a layer of mulch and I had worked on many projects before the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:26">0:26:26-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  orchard where if we put six inches or about 15 centimeters of these wood chips, they would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:39</a>:</strong>  last for about three years or they decompose at the rate of about an inch a year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:39">0:26:39-0:26:42</a>:</strong>  So you would have a good mulch for three years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:42">0:26:42-0:26:43</a>:</strong>  And I thought, huh, great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:43">0:26:43-0:26:52</a>:</strong>  You know, so we scrounged around, managed to get about a hundred cubic yards of wood<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:52">0:26:52-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  chips.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:26:56</a>:</strong>  And that's a tractor trailer load equivalent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:56">0:26:56-0:26:58</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:26:58">0:26:58-0:27:00</a>:</strong>  We spread that by hand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:00">0:27:00-0:27:04</a>:</strong>  I don't know if anybody's ever emptied a tractor trailer load.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:04">0:27:04-0:27:05</a>:</strong>  It's not a small amount.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:05">0:27:05-0:27:07</a>:</strong>  So it's a lot of work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:07">0:27:07-0:27:12</a>:</strong>  So we put it out, but it was done and it was like, that's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:12">0:27:12-0:27:13</a>:</strong>  That was November.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:13">0:27:13-0:27:20</a>:</strong>  And by when the snow melted in late March, early April, and the grass started to green,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:20">0:27:20-0:27:23</a>:</strong>  it would be green right across the whole field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:23">0:27:23-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  There was no visible lines of wood chips left.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:31</a>:</strong>  And I thought, well, that's impossible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:31">0:27:31-0:27:35</a>:</strong>  You know, we put in, I know we have photos.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:35">0:27:35-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  And so I thought, what's going on here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:43</a>:</strong>  Well, by June, we were looking for our orchard in the grass, and that's not a good way to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:43">0:27:43-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  start an orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:51</a>:</strong>  If you can't even see the trees because of the grass, you can't expect the trees to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:51">0:27:51-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  So we were at risk of losing the orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:27:56</a>:</strong>  And that's a lot of work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:56">0:27:56-0:27:59</a>:</strong>  I mean, planting is actually the least work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:27:59">0:27:59-0:28:01</a>:</strong>  It's getting, we grew all our own trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:01">0:28:01-0:28:07</a>:</strong>  So it's growing your trees for basically three years before and starting rootstock and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:07">0:28:07-0:28:09</a>:</strong>  grafting and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:09">0:28:09-0:28:13</a>:</strong>  So that was like, we got to do something or we're going to lose the orchard because the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:13">0:28:13-0:28:15</a>:</strong>  trees are overwhelmed by grass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:15">0:28:15-0:28:18</a>:</strong>  We could mow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:18">0:28:18-0:28:20</a>:</strong>  But the thing is, you got to know where your trees are exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:20">0:28:20-0:28:24</a>:</strong>  Because if you don't see them, anyway, it was a lot of work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:24">0:28:24-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  And we decided we got to do something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  Let's try some plastic because we had used plastic in the nursery and it was so, so much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:31">0:28:31-0:28:37</a>:</strong>  easier that we said, maybe if we could put some of this big thick silage plastic, we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:37">0:28:37-0:28:40</a>:</strong>  could work underneath the trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:40">0:28:40-0:28:43</a>:</strong>  So we did, which is something I would never do again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:43">0:28:43-0:28:47</a>:</strong>  Not that I don't want to use plastic, but I would never do it the way I show you to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:47">0:28:47-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  use in the film.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:54</a>:</strong>  So you could see there's some, there's been improvements over the years of how we do things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:28:54">0:28:54-0:29:00</a>:</strong>  simply because it would take us four people one week to do one acre of laying plastic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:00">0:29:00-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  mulch the way we did after we had put the trees in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:11</a>:</strong>  So the big difference now is I would have somebody come in and they could do 12 acres<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:11">0:29:11-0:29:17</a>:</strong>  in a day with a mulch layer and they could lay down the plastic mulch with drip irrigation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:17">0:29:17-0:29:19</a>:</strong>  under the plastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:19">0:29:19-0:29:24</a>:</strong>  And then you come in and you plant your small, small fruit trees and you're good to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:24">0:29:24-0:29:30</a>:</strong>  You got an orchard that is super low maintenance because you don't have to be putting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:30">0:29:30-0:29:36</a>:</strong>  anything to control grass, which even in organic, because you don't have herbicides, what you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:36">0:29:36-0:29:42</a>:</strong>  would do is you'd use a, like a cultivator and you would basically weed under the trees<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:42">0:29:42-0:29:45</a>:</strong>  when they're young with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:45">0:29:45-0:29:52</a>:</strong>  And I've seen other people use acids to put, like you could use even cider vinegar to put<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:52">0:29:52-0:29:55</a>:</strong>  underneath the trees that will kill the grass and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:29:55">0:29:55-0:30:00</a>:</strong>  So there's organic techniques that are approved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:00">0:30:00-0:30:01</a>:</strong>  But we went with plastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:01">0:30:01-0:30:08</a>:</strong>  And so I say, you know, don't think of plastic until you've got over 200 trees because you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:08">0:30:08-0:30:11</a>:</strong>  really could mulch for 200 trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:11">0:30:11-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  You really could mulch that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:16</a>:</strong>  It's it's a big job, but it's doable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:16">0:30:16-0:30:21</a>:</strong>  Well, when we're talking five acres and we needed to put at least three times more mulch<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:21">0:30:21-0:30:25</a>:</strong>  than we did, which means three tractor loads times five acres.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:25">0:30:25-0:30:28</a>:</strong>  Now you're talking 15 tractor loads.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:28">0:30:28-0:30:31</a>:</strong>  Maybe you can't handle that amount of material by hand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:31">0:30:31-0:30:33</a>:</strong>  You think, oh, I'm young, I'm strong.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:33">0:30:33-0:30:37</a>:</strong>  Listen, start with one tractor trailer load, unload that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:37">0:30:37-0:30:42</a>:</strong>  And you tell me if you're good for 15 and you have to do that every year pretty well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:42">0:30:42-0:30:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:43">0:30:43-0:30:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:44">0:30:44-0:30:46</a>:</strong>  Well, not realistic at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:46">0:30:46-0:30:47</a>:</strong>  It's a different thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:47">0:30:47-0:30:55</a>:</strong>  So one of the things I learned early was my experience was all in garden projects and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:30:57</a>:</strong>  yard projects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:30:57">0:30:57-0:31:03</a>:</strong>  And I quickly learned the orchard is no longer a garden or yard scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:03">0:31:03-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  It is a much bigger scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:10</a>:</strong>  And so you have to think in terms of scale, as long as you're leaving it, your orchard<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:10">0:31:10-0:31:16</a>:</strong>  to a yard, then you can do a lot of things very differently from what you would do when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:16">0:31:16-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  you're talking acres of area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:22">0:31:22-0:31:26</a>:</strong>  At that scale, the economics of it just changes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:26">0:31:26-0:31:30</a>:</strong>  And so you've done a really good job about harvesting nature's resources to help you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:30">0:31:30-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  with a lot of the maintenance and the balance of the ecosystem that you're cultivating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  Can you talk a little bit about how you work to attract beneficial predators and insects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:48</a>:</strong>  and help to keep away some of the hazards and the pests through just smart design?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:48">0:31:48-0:31:51</a>:</strong>  Well, the biggest is the biodiversity right from the start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:51">0:31:51-0:31:54</a>:</strong>  So that's an essential.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:54">0:31:54-0:31:59</a>:</strong>  As soon as we did that with not really any other major change from the way the orchard<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:31:59">0:31:59-0:32:05</a>:</strong>  was before, we got rid of our worst pest, which was a caterpillar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:05">0:32:05-0:32:07</a>:</strong>  And that was so convincing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:07">0:32:07-0:32:11</a>:</strong>  When I planted the orchard, I actually didn't say a word about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:11">0:32:11-0:32:14</a>:</strong>  I kept my gate closed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:14">0:32:14-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  I didn't want anybody to come by and visit because the few people who did look and say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:20">0:32:20-0:32:24</a>:</strong>  they basically were telling me how crazy it was and how it'll never work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:24">0:32:24-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  Well, listen, when I planted, I wasn't convinced.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:29</a>:</strong>  I mean, it's one thing to read.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:29">0:32:29-0:32:32</a>:</strong>  And let me let me stop on this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:32">0:32:32-0:32:37</a>:</strong>  You can read all kinds of stuff and you can watch the film about the permaculture orchard<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:37">0:32:37-0:32:39</a>:</strong>  and say, oh, look at what he did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:42</a>:</strong>  And all you know is what you see.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:42">0:32:42-0:32:44</a>:</strong>  So there's levels of knowing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:44">0:32:44-0:32:48</a>:</strong>  You can know because you read about it or you saw it in a video.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:48">0:32:48-0:32:52</a>:</strong>  That's all you do is you know that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:52">0:32:52-0:32:57</a>:</strong>  But then there is knowing with conviction, which happens only when you've actually tried<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:32:57">0:32:57-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  it and done it and done it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:04</a>:</strong>  Even I would say done it at a scale that you want to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:04">0:33:04-0:33:08</a>:</strong>  Then you get a level of conviction that is basically unshakable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:08">0:33:08-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  Like I can people can say all kinds of things, but I kind of just smile and say, well, thank<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:17</a>:</strong>  you for your your point of view.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:17">0:33:17-0:33:18</a>:</strong>  And right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:18">0:33:18-0:33:24</a>:</strong>  And it I like to say to people who and there are people who criticize because there will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:24">0:33:24-0:33:27</a>:</strong>  always be people who criticize and that's just normal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:27">0:33:27-0:33:30</a>:</strong>  And I'll just say that's that's a good point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:30">0:33:30-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  I said, how many trees do you have?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:33:33</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:33">0:33:33-0:33:38</a>:</strong>  And that usually stops them dead because some of the people who are most vocal are also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:38">0:33:38-0:33:42</a>:</strong>  the ones who are armchair gardeners or farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:42">0:33:42-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  And they've read and they've heard and they've listened to Mark Sheppard and they've listened<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:50</a>:</strong>  to what I said and they've listened to other people and they'll have comments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:50">0:33:50-0:33:56</a>:</strong>  But hey, get off your couch, get out of your chair and get planting, get doing, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:56">0:33:56-0:33:59</a>:</strong>  all you know is your telephone effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:33:59">0:33:59-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  And until you actually start doing it and trying it and practicing it, you really don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:08</a>:</strong>  know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:08">0:34:08-0:34:11</a>:</strong>  You just you know, you'll propagate ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:11">0:34:11-0:34:17</a>:</strong>  And that's one of the dangers of seeing books written by people who basically glean information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:17">0:34:17-0:34:18</a>:</strong>  from others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:18">0:34:18-0:34:23</a>:</strong>  They're just repeating what others say, but they've never tried it out for themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:23">0:34:23-0:34:24</a>:</strong>  Of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:30</a>:</strong>  So in balancing this ecosystem, what are some of the methods that you recommend people do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:30">0:34:30-0:34:34</a>:</strong>  to really invite a cooperation with nature?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:34">0:34:34-0:34:37</a>:</strong>  And you know, you started with the diversity of your plantings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:37">0:34:37-0:34:44</a>:</strong>  Can you create habitat in other ways or incentives for the wildlife that you want to come maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:44">0:34:44-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  even before these plantings are established?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:34:47</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:47">0:34:47-0:34:52</a>:</strong>  I mean, some of the quick ones, the easiest and we're talking, let's say wildlife.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:52">0:34:52-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  Wildlife have three basic needs, food, cover and water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:35:01</a>:</strong>  So food, you could think, well, you know, what can I do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:01">0:35:01-0:35:03</a>:</strong>  Well, you could probably add a feeder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:03">0:35:03-0:35:06</a>:</strong>  So if you're going to put trees, put in a feeder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:06">0:35:06-0:35:12</a>:</strong>  It's not the same birds exactly that are going to eat your, let's say seed as will eat your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:12">0:35:12-0:35:13</a>:</strong>  fruit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:13">0:35:13-0:35:18</a>:</strong>  Or if you're in a more Southern area, you could actually give them fruit and then you'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:18">0:35:18-0:35:22</a>:</strong>  get birds who like to eat fruit and they, you could put a fruit feeder and that works<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:22">0:35:22-0:35:26</a>:</strong>  well in the tropics and subtropics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:26">0:35:26-0:35:27</a>:</strong>  So that's one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:27">0:35:27-0:35:31</a>:</strong>  So food is a simple, quick, I like to say, you know, do the quick stuff first because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:31">0:35:31-0:35:33</a>:</strong>  you could do that this weekend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:36</a>:</strong>  So get out a feeder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:36">0:35:36-0:35:38</a>:</strong>  The next thing is, is cover.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:38">0:35:38-0:35:39</a>:</strong>  That takes a little longer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:39">0:35:39-0:35:43</a>:</strong>  You want to give them a place that they feel safe to hide in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:43">0:35:43-0:35:49</a>:</strong>  If you look at, let's say our orchard, we actually planted this year plantings just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:49">0:35:49-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  for habitat for cover for the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:57</a>:</strong>  And because in the orchard, in the winter time, it's completely stark.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:57">0:35:57-0:35:59</a>:</strong>  Like it's just branches.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:35:59">0:35:59-0:36:00</a>:</strong>  There's no leaves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:00">0:36:00-0:36:01</a>:</strong>  All the leaves have fallen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:01">0:36:01-0:36:02</a>:</strong>  We're in a deciduous climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:02">0:36:02-0:36:07</a>:</strong>  There's no evergreen leaves or persistent leaves on the trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:07">0:36:07-0:36:13</a>:</strong>  So we started to plant a Cedar tree, which is a evergreen in our climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:19</a>:</strong>  And we put in a whole row down the middle, basically where birds will be able to come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:19">0:36:19-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  into the orchard and in the future, as these trees grow and feel safe there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:25</a>:</strong>  So that's the importance of cover.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:25">0:36:25-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  And you say, well, that's planting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:28</a>:</strong>  And that takes a while.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:28">0:36:28-0:36:33</a>:</strong>  So if you're pruning branches, you can make brush piles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:33">0:36:33-0:36:38</a>:</strong>  And we got hundreds of yards of brush pile all around the orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:38">0:36:38-0:36:41</a>:</strong>  So that's an important one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:41">0:36:41-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  You can even start with just one pile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:46</a>:</strong>  And there are some species that will use that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:46">0:36:46-0:36:50</a>:</strong>  So cover is really, it's often the critical factor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:36:52</a>:</strong>  It's what's usually most lacking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:52">0:36:52-0:36:55</a>:</strong>  And another simple one is water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:36:55">0:36:55-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  So a good example, if you've ever had tomatoes and you've had, especially in our climate,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:05</a>:</strong>  we get squirrels eating tomatoes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:05">0:37:05-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  Well if you have that, that's a sure sign that you just don't have any water around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  because a squirrel doesn't prefer tomatoes, but it will drink the liquid or the juice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:18</a>:</strong>  out of the tomato when it needs water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:18">0:37:18-0:37:20</a>:</strong>  And it's only doing it to get some water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:20">0:37:20-0:37:24</a>:</strong>  So you can get cues that way that, oh, you know what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:24">0:37:24-0:37:25</a>:</strong>  I don't have enough water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:25">0:37:25-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  We'll put in a bird bath, then maybe put in a pond, a little pond, and then put in a bigger<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:32</a>:</strong>  pond.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:32">0:37:32-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  So these are the kinds of things you can do and it adds to the diversity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  And once you've got these key elements, for example, in one of, we have little ponds,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:48</a>:</strong>  we're in totally sandy soil and we have to add water every few days to a little pond<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:48">0:37:48-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  just for it to hold water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:51">0:37:51-0:37:58</a>:</strong>  But we have one area that's a little more clay because we had a load of rock dust dumped<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:37:58">0:37:58-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  there and where the rock dust is, it makes like a clay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  And because that's a pond and it stays wet and it's basically a clay surface, that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:14</a>:</strong>  where all the wasps come that are, that need balls of, it's the mud wasp that need balls<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:14">0:38:14-0:38:16</a>:</strong>  of mud.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:16">0:38:16-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  And we wouldn't have mud wasps if we didn't have that pond.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  So that's the limiting factor to getting that kind of wasp.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:27</a>:</strong>  And then we can add structures for some of the insects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:27">0:38:27-0:38:35</a>:</strong>  So we do add logs for bees and pieces of wood, wood holes drill them for bees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:35">0:38:35-0:38:39</a>:</strong>  And that's a whole range of different species of bees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:44</a>:</strong>  We have put up biotopes, which are basically little shelters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:44">0:38:44-0:38:48</a>:</strong>  It's more than an insect hotel because it's for insects, it's for birds, it's for bats,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:48">0:38:48-0:38:53</a>:</strong>  it's for snakes and frogs and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:53">0:38:53-0:38:59</a>:</strong>  So yeah, that's pushing it because, well, that's my background and I want to see what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:38:59">0:38:59-0:39:00</a>:</strong>  we can do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:00">0:39:00-0:39:03</a>:</strong>  The simplest things that we could do, but that were the most effective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:03">0:39:03-0:39:10</a>:</strong>  But your two keys, at least in our climate, temperate climate for reducing insects that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:10">0:39:10-0:39:14</a>:</strong>  will help you a lot is birds and wasps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:14">0:39:14-0:39:19</a>:</strong>  And if people don't like wasps, well, get over it and get used to it because they are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:19">0:39:19-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  the single most important insect in the orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:28</a>:</strong>  And it's one of the things that I love that when you kind of get into this attitude of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:28">0:39:28-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  working with nature, you don't have to do a lot of the detailed work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:37</a>:</strong>  Sometimes it's just a matter of getting out of the way or providing the really base tools<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:37">0:39:37-0:39:39</a>:</strong>  or resources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:39">0:39:39-0:39:40</a>:</strong>  And that's where life takes over.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:40">0:39:40-0:39:44</a>:</strong>  And if they have what they need to survive and thrive, it just starts to compound on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:44">0:39:44-0:39:47</a>:</strong>  itself as those resources become available.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:47">0:39:47-0:39:48</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:48">0:39:48-0:39:51</a>:</strong>  That's a great summary.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:51">0:39:51-0:39:55</a>:</strong>  Let's talk a little bit, another thing that you're very good at is diversifying not only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:55">0:39:55-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  the ecology that you're working with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:40:02</a>:</strong>  So you've moved away from monocultures, you've provided the resources for wildlife and beneficial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:02">0:40:02-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  insects to come in and start to balance itself out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:07</a>:</strong>  But you also work with chickens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:07">0:40:07-0:40:11</a>:</strong>  And I know you have other kind of complementary enterprises on the farm that help with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:11">0:40:11-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  fertility, the soil building and all of these.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:19</a>:</strong>  Can you talk about how this fits into the larger plan of the health of the orchard and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:24</a>:</strong>  even helps with the economics and the resiliency of the farm enterprise?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:24">0:40:24-0:40:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I kind of look at agriculture really needs in our, again, I'll say in our climate,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:33">0:40:33-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  but in a lot of climates, trees are essential.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:45</a>:</strong>  So where trees can grow, trees are really important for the ecosystem, but also for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:45">0:40:45-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  the system to function well, because it's the habitat and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:52</a>:</strong>  So trees are one and then animals are one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:52">0:40:52-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  So if you think, well, you know, and I've heard a lot of people who would be a vegan<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:03</a>:</strong>  would say, well, yeah, but I don't want animals because I just want to grow the plants and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:03">0:41:03-0:41:04</a>:</strong>  that's fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:04">0:41:04-0:41:10</a>:</strong>  But it's so much harder because the plants really rely on the animals and the animals<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:10">0:41:10-0:41:11</a>:</strong>  rely on the plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:11">0:41:11-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  It is part of the ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:20</a>:</strong>  So it's, you can't really get enough wildlife often to do the impact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:20">0:41:20-0:41:28</a>:</strong>  And so raising animals is a good way to add to the impact and say, well, I don't want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  to raise animals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:33</a>:</strong>  Okay, then keep them as a, you know, have a shelter for animals and keep animals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:33">0:41:33-0:41:39</a>:</strong>  But the animal impact is really, really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:39">0:41:39-0:41:48</a>:</strong>  You can't build soil as quickly as you can with a pulsed system of, especially a mob<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:48">0:41:48-0:41:49</a>:</strong>  grazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:49">0:41:49-0:41:54</a>:</strong>  And mob grazing, if you're not familiar with it, look in the words mob grazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:41:54">0:41:54-0:42:01</a>:</strong>  It's far more than for years, the system was encouraged to do rotational grazing or intensive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:01">0:42:01-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  rotational grazing, or another word is called management intensive grazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:07</a>:</strong>  Those are great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:07">0:42:07-0:42:10</a>:</strong>  And that's, you know, start with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:10">0:42:10-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  And then as you progress, you'll learn, wow, we could even take this a big step further<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  where we're talking mob grazing, which is a very limited time on a small area with a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:28</a>:</strong>  given amount of animal impact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:28">0:42:28-0:42:30</a>:</strong>  And that changes it even more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:30">0:42:30-0:42:35</a>:</strong>  Like some of the practitioners in our area, there's one guy who I think he has the highest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:35">0:42:35-0:42:41</a>:</strong>  organic matter soils in our part of the country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:41">0:42:41-0:42:45</a>:</strong>  His soils go from 14% to 24% organic matter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:45">0:42:45-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  Well, 24% organic matter is like your best vegetable soils kind of thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:42:53</a>:</strong>  And he's got that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:53">0:42:53-0:42:55</a>:</strong>  Nearly compost at that point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:55">0:42:55-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  It's incredible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:43:02</a>:</strong>  He never has puddles happening because you've got such a huge sponge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:02">0:43:02-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  So now he's actually looking at, well, maybe we should start doing something to use some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:08</a>:</strong>  of this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:08">0:43:08-0:43:13</a>:</strong>  Cause like how far do you want to, you know, compound this amount of organic matter, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:13">0:43:13-0:43:19</a>:</strong>  that's what happens when he moves his animals four times a day and he's talking sheep, mostly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:19">0:43:19-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  cows and sheep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  But if you move animals four times a day and they only come back at sometimes of the year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:36</a>:</strong>  in 60 or 70 days, wow, that, that gives the grass lots of time to recover.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:36">0:43:36-0:43:39</a>:</strong>  And it, it, it really works with the grass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:39">0:43:39-0:43:41</a>:</strong>  Like this is not something new.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:41">0:43:41-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  The Buffalo did this and the, you know, the wildebeest do this and we really need to,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:53</a>:</strong>  if we're looking to nature as a, an inspiration, we need to learn what exactly is nature doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:53">0:43:53-0:43:58</a>:</strong>  and how exactly, what's the pattern, what animals interact in this system?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:43:58">0:43:58-0:44:02</a>:</strong>  Cause it's not just plants, it's a plant animal interaction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:02">0:44:02-0:44:07</a>:</strong>  And there is a reason why there's a whole group of animals called herbivores and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:07">0:44:07-0:44:10</a>:</strong>  eat grass or they eat vegetation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:10">0:44:10-0:44:13</a>:</strong>  And then it could be browsers as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:13">0:44:13-0:44:21</a>:</strong>  But these are really a critical part of this system and we need to try to bring them in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:21">0:44:21-0:44:23</a>:</strong>  and use them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:23">0:44:23-0:44:29</a>:</strong>  And that's how, that is a great way to increase the soil, increase the soil carbon, increase<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:29">0:44:29-0:44:35</a>:</strong>  the organic matter, increase the fertility, increase the fungal biomass in the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:35">0:44:35-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  I mean, there's the benefits just keep, it's like a virtuous cycle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:39">0:44:39-0:44:43</a>:</strong>  Everything just keeps getting better and better and better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:43">0:44:43-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  And the fact for us, for the orchard of having a diversity of tree species, wow, it, it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:44:52</a>:</strong>  it really is getting to be easier and easier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:52">0:44:52-0:44:55</a>:</strong>  And the amount of work really goes down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:55">0:44:55-0:44:58</a>:</strong>  We had our absolute best year ever this year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:58">0:44:58-0:44:59</a>:</strong>  We've never had such a crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:44:59">0:44:59-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  Like we, we left, I think 40 or 50 trees loaded with fruit because we didn't even know what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  to do with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:11</a>:</strong>  We'd given away free fruit for two weekends.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:11">0:45:11-0:45:18</a>:</strong>  And it's like, well, everybody who, you know, we've contacted has come and everybody's got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:18">0:45:18-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  everything they need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  So it's a, it's a nice situation when the system starts to respond and really, really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:28</a>:</strong>  kick in and produce.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:28">0:45:28-0:45:31</a>:</strong>  So it is a virtuous cycle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:31">0:45:31-0:45:36</a>:</strong>  And if you work with nature rather than working against nature, and I mean anything that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:36">0:45:36-0:45:42</a>:</strong>  that responds or relies on killing them, you kind of going a little bit in the wrong direction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:42">0:45:42-0:45:43</a>:</strong>  there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:43">0:45:43-0:45:48</a>:</strong>  I don't say we don't kill some things cause we do trap a couple of insects that we aim<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:45:50</a>:</strong>  to reduce their population.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:50">0:45:50-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  But for the majority of things that were a problem, they're no longer a problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:45:56">0:45:56-0:46:00</a>:</strong>  There's some great points there about, you know, mostly working to balance the ecosystem,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:00">0:46:00-0:46:05</a>:</strong>  but you mentioned that you do actually come in and interfere a little bit with those insect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:05">0:46:05-0:46:06</a>:</strong>  populations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:06">0:46:06-0:46:11</a>:</strong>  Could you talk a little bit about when you decide that it's necessary to take some matters<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:11">0:46:11-0:46:16</a>:</strong>  into your own hands and how you've chosen to do that in the case of insects and things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:16">0:46:16-0:46:18</a>:</strong>  like blights that can affect your trees?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:18">0:46:18-0:46:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well first, certainly insects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:22">0:46:22-0:46:29</a>:</strong>  Most places, I would say now, at least in the Western world, have some form of a scouting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:29">0:46:29-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  service.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  It could be governmental, it could be private.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:37</a>:</strong>  And so the scouting is very useful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:37">0:46:37-0:46:45</a>:</strong>  They will usually tell you there is a certain insect that has started to be caught in traps<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:45">0:46:45-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  and so we're nearing a threshold.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  And so that, I use that service in our area in Quebec and I just really want to know when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:55">0:46:55-0:46:58</a>:</strong>  is an insect starting to be seen?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:58">0:46:58-0:46:59</a>:</strong>  Cause it's just handy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:46:59">0:46:59-0:47:04</a>:</strong>  You can do your own, but they're actually doing that every day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:04">0:47:04-0:47:12</a>:</strong>  And so once they start trapping a certain insect in my area, then I go ahead and usually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:12">0:47:12-0:47:13</a>:</strong>  we do trapping.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:13">0:47:13-0:47:17</a>:</strong>  So we trap for coddling moth and we trap for apple maggot fly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:17">0:47:17-0:47:23</a>:</strong>  So that service gives me a date when I need to have, and I always know the approximate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:23">0:47:23-0:47:27</a>:</strong>  date, but that can change plus or minus 10 days in a year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:27">0:47:27-0:47:32</a>:</strong>  And so then I go ahead and we set out traps for those insects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:32">0:47:32-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  And what kind of traps do you use?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:36</a>:</strong>  What have you found to be effective?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:36">0:47:36-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  Well we, we've actually made our own traps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:45</a>:</strong>  So we have a very simple, it's a recycled oil container that we use to trap coddling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:45">0:47:45-0:47:52</a>:</strong>  moth and we just drill four holes at the top to allow the moths, adult moths to enter the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:52">0:47:52-0:47:53</a>:</strong>  trap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:53">0:47:53-0:47:58</a>:</strong>  And inside we just put a mix of molasses and water, 50-50.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:47:58">0:47:58-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  So we put about two inches or four or five centimeters inside and that's enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:05">0:48:05-0:48:10</a>:</strong>  So once the moth comes in, they'll drown in the trap.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:10">0:48:10-0:48:11</a>:</strong>  And so they've been really effective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:11">0:48:11-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  We've had as little as 3% damage, which is the acceptable amount for conventional orchards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:22</a>:</strong>  And so by trapping that that way, it's really nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:22">0:48:22-0:48:28</a>:</strong>  We set out one trap per trio or one trap per three trees, and that works really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:28">0:48:28-0:48:32</a>:</strong>  We do have to come back in the season and check them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:32">0:48:32-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  And if there isn't enough liquid, then we'll usually just top it off with water because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:40</a>:</strong>  it's not the molasses that evaporates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:40">0:48:40-0:48:42</a>:</strong>  It's just the water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:42">0:48:42-0:48:44</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:44">0:48:44-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  And you also use a biological spray.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:57</a>:</strong>  I got from the film that you use whey concoction, the byproduct of cheese production to coat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:57">0:48:57-0:48:58</a>:</strong>  the leaves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:48:58">0:48:58-0:49:02</a>:</strong>  Can you tell me how that works in balance with the ecosystem?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:02">0:49:02-0:49:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah, whey is a great product actually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:06">0:49:06-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  I love the idea that you can spray something on the trees that you can just stop and have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:13</a>:</strong>  a drink from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:13">0:49:13-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  So if you can eat it or you can drink it, then to spray it is pretty safe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:25</a>:</strong>  The only caveat I'd say is if someone is really intolerant to lactose, there will be some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:25">0:49:25-0:49:28</a>:</strong>  lactose in whey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:28">0:49:28-0:49:34</a>:</strong>  But that's the only case of any kind of problem we've seen with using whey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:34">0:49:34-0:49:38</a>:</strong>  It doesn't actually kill anything on the leaves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:38">0:49:38-0:49:45</a>:</strong>  And the way it works is it just outcompetes the fungal spores for the food that the fungus<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:45">0:49:45-0:49:47</a>:</strong>  need to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:47">0:49:47-0:49:53</a>:</strong>  And so if you spray whey, and usually you'll spray like you would spray for any fungicide,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:53">0:49:53-0:49:57</a>:</strong>  you spray a couple of days, a day or two before a rain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:49:57">0:49:57-0:50:05</a>:</strong>  And the spray in whey, what it does is the bacteria in the whey will go on the leaf as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:05">0:50:05-0:50:11</a>:</strong>  you spray it, and they will eat up the exudates or the sugars that are naturally found on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:11">0:50:11-0:50:13</a>:</strong>  the top and the bottom of the leaf.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:13">0:50:13-0:50:18</a>:</strong>  And they'll eat the sugars so that then when the rain falls, a day or two later, and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:18">0:50:18-0:50:26</a>:</strong>  spores start to come out, basically think of it as hatching while they hatch and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:26">0:50:26-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  are free in the air.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:30</a>:</strong>  And when they land on the leaf, they immediately germinate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:30">0:50:30-0:50:34</a>:</strong>  They send out a little equivalent of a little rootlet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:34">0:50:34-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  But as soon as that rootlet goes out and seeks to grow, which is seeking to actually get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:40">0:50:40-0:50:43</a>:</strong>  established, they don't find any food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:43">0:50:43-0:50:48</a>:</strong>  There's no sugar left because the bacteria from the whey have eaten all the sugars.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:48">0:50:48-0:50:51</a>:</strong>  And so the spores just die.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:51">0:50:51-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  And so it's nice to know that it actually doesn't kill them, but they do die, but not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:51:00</a>:</strong>  from the direct application of the whey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:00">0:51:00-0:51:04</a>:</strong>  They just die because they have no food left on the leaf surface.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:04">0:51:04-0:51:08</a>:</strong>  So it's nice because we could spray whey and we get a lot of mushroom growth now happening<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:08">0:51:08-0:51:09</a>:</strong>  in the orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:09">0:51:09-0:51:15</a>:</strong>  So as opposed to putting anything that's a fungicide or something that kills fungus,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:15">0:51:15-0:51:17</a>:</strong>  this doesn't kill it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:17">0:51:17-0:51:24</a>:</strong>  It actually feeds fungus that are in the soil because there's products in there that the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:24">0:51:24-0:51:31</a>:</strong>  fungus can feed on without actually feeding the fungus on the leaf.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:31">0:51:31-0:51:35</a>:</strong>  It's so simple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:35">0:51:35-0:51:41</a>:</strong>  The guy I learned this from said we should actually throw out cheese and drink the whey<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:41">0:51:41-0:51:46</a>:</strong>  because it's where all the nutrition is in the milk after you make cheese.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:46">0:51:46-0:51:51</a>:</strong>  The cheese is just the agglutination or the gathering of all the fats and the whey is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:51">0:51:51-0:51:55</a>:</strong>  all the protein and the nutrition and the vitamins and minerals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:55">0:51:55-0:51:57</a>:</strong>  I agree with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:51:57">0:51:57-0:52:01</a>:</strong>  So we used to produce cheese on the farm in Guatemala and we would always save the whey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:01">0:52:01-0:52:06</a>:</strong>  And what we didn't consume ourselves, we either used to inoculate fermentations for preserving<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:06">0:52:06-0:52:11</a>:</strong>  food or we would put it in our animal feed so that they got more protein and we didn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:11">0:52:11-0:52:13</a>:</strong>  have to use nearly as much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:13">0:52:13-0:52:15</a>:</strong>  There's a million and one uses for that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:15">0:52:15-0:52:16</a>:</strong>  It's excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:16">0:52:16-0:52:18</a>:</strong>  And there's just one more to add to the tool belt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:18">0:52:18-0:52:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and it's an approved organic product.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:22">0:52:22-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  So anybody who's looking to grow organically, it's not a problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:27</a>:</strong>  You can use whey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:27">0:52:27-0:52:30</a>:</strong>  And there's so much of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:30">0:52:30-0:52:37</a>:</strong>  I mean, there is literally more than enough whey to replace all fungicide use in agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:37">0:52:37-0:52:39</a>:</strong>  Let me say that again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:39">0:52:39-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  We could replace all the fungicides used in agriculture by using whey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:48</a>:</strong>  And in fact, I was doing some studies last winter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:55</a>:</strong>  What's, cause I, we did a study here in Quebec 20, almost 25 years ago on using whey and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:55">0:52:55-0:52:59</a>:</strong>  were, they found that it's as effective as using conventional sprays.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:52:59">0:52:59-0:53:00</a>:</strong>  Wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:00">0:53:00-0:53:05</a>:</strong>  That's a little disturbing to, let's say some industries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:05">0:53:05-0:53:09</a>:</strong>  And so that report never, never was made public.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:09">0:53:09-0:53:16</a>:</strong>  But I did see some more recent research and in Australia in organic grape growing, they've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:16">0:53:16-0:53:24</a>:</strong>  been using it quite extensively and they were, the quantities they used, I was just, I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:24">0:53:24-0:53:25</a>:</strong>  mind boggling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:25">0:53:25-0:53:34</a>:</strong>  They're using 4% whey, which means the quantity of active, basically of whey and bacteria<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:34">0:53:34-0:53:41</a>:</strong>  is only 4% of the volume of, of liquid sprayed on the orchard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:41">0:53:41-0:53:44</a>:</strong>  So it's a tiny amount.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:44">0:53:44-0:53:49</a>:</strong>  We use a hundred percent just because, Hey, we can get it for free or just about, we just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:49">0:53:49-0:53:52</a>:</strong>  pay for the transport.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:52">0:53:52-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  And it is a foliar feed, like you said, the protein and the vitamins, it is good for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:53:59</a>:</strong>  trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:53:59">0:53:59-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  And so the idea of using 4%, so I thought, wow, I mean, even if we use that a hundred<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:09</a>:</strong>  percent, there's enough to replace all fungicide use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:09">0:54:09-0:54:19</a>:</strong>  And if you dilute it by 50% or 75% or even going to 90, you know, 96% diluted, I thought,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:19">0:54:19-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  wow, we certainly have enough whey to replace all fungicides and it would be better for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:25</a>:</strong>  the plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:25">0:54:25-0:54:32</a>:</strong>  It's kind of this thing that really needs to get this information out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:32">0:54:32-0:54:33</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:33">0:54:33-0:54:38</a>:</strong>  I'm not holding my breath though, that it will happen because let's just say that it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:38">0:54:38-0:54:44</a>:</strong>  a little disturbing for some very profitable, you know, enterprises.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:44">0:54:44-0:54:45</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:45">0:54:45-0:54:49</a>:</strong>  It's just so wonderful for the people in the know and the fact that it's cheap or free<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:49">0:54:49-0:54:51</a>:</strong>  like that is incredible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:51">0:54:51-0:54:55</a>:</strong>  Now look, Stefan, there's one more thing that I really want to cover that I was blown away<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:55">0:54:55-0:54:59</a>:</strong>  by as I've watched your YouTube videos and the other information you've put out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:54:59">0:54:59-0:55:06</a>:</strong>  And that's the way that you market your products and make a better return on selling basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:06">0:55:06-0:55:10</a>:</strong>  wholesale produce like this and the various other products that you go to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:10">0:55:10-0:55:13</a>:</strong>  I realized that that's one of the big sticking points for a lot of people who get into farming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:13">0:55:13-0:55:20</a>:</strong>  is it can be pretty dismal, the returns that you get when you're selling through to middlemen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:20">0:55:20-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  who are just putting it out in the grocery stores.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:22">0:55:22-0:55:26</a>:</strong>  So could you talk a little bit about the marketing methods and the way that you get your hands<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:26">0:55:26-0:55:31</a>:</strong>  directly into the consumers who want this higher quality product?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:31">0:55:31-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah, actually I would recommend people, if you want the whole presentation, I gave a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:41</a>:</strong>  presentation in New Zealand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:41">0:55:41-0:55:43</a>:</strong>  It's called membership marketing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:43">0:55:43-0:55:51</a>:</strong>  If you just type in membership marketing on YouTube, James Samuel recorded the video when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:51">0:55:51-0:55:52</a>:</strong>  we did it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:52">0:55:52-0:55:54</a>:</strong>  And it's a really good summary of how it works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:54">0:55:54-0:55:56</a>:</strong>  So it's basically, it's not my idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:56">0:55:56-0:55:57</a>:</strong>  It's not my technique.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:55:57">0:55:57-0:56:04</a>:</strong>  It was put out by a gentleman called Booker T. Watley in the 70s or early 80s.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:04">0:56:04-0:56:10</a>:</strong>  He wrote a book, How to Make $120,000 on 25 Acres.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:10">0:56:10-0:56:16</a>:</strong>  And he basically outlined his formula, which is basically a membership marketing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:16">0:56:16-0:56:20</a>:</strong>  So you're not selling to stores.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:20">0:56:20-0:56:22</a>:</strong>  You're not picking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:22">0:56:22-0:56:24</a>:</strong>  Most importantly, you're not picking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:24">0:56:24-0:56:32</a>:</strong>  You get people coming as a U-pick, but on top of being a U-pick, they actually join<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:32">0:56:32-0:56:34</a>:</strong>  as members for the year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:34">0:56:34-0:56:39</a>:</strong>  So pay you a fee early in the year, and then they come and pick and pay whatever the going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:39">0:56:39-0:56:43</a>:</strong>  price that you set for them to pick.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:43">0:56:43-0:56:49</a>:</strong>  So I aim to be priced at about a conventional grocery store price.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:49">0:56:49-0:56:53</a>:</strong>  And so people who are used to conventional stores, they think, well, you know, it's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:53">0:56:53-0:56:58</a>:</strong>  really an advantage shopping here because I have to pick it on top of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:56:58">0:56:58-0:57:03</a>:</strong>  But anybody who's used to buying organic, they go, wow, like you could get easily half<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:03">0:57:03-0:57:07</a>:</strong>  price or less on some of the things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:07">0:57:07-0:57:09</a>:</strong>  So there is a big difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:09">0:57:09-0:57:15</a>:</strong>  And the biggest difference is we don't have to do the majority of the harvest, which if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:15">0:57:15-0:57:22</a>:</strong>  you look at the economics of most crops, 40% of the cost of production is harvest and packaging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:22">0:57:22-0:57:26</a>:</strong>  And people always underestimate packaging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:26">0:57:26-0:57:28</a>:</strong>  So it's a great way, but there are caveats.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:28">0:57:28-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  Like you have to be within 30 minutes of 30,000 people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:39</a>:</strong>  And we're really not, our farm is not ideally situated for the model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:39">0:57:39-0:57:40</a>:</strong>  We're pretty well known.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:40">0:57:40-0:57:47</a>:</strong>  So we do get people, but we're still not, we're not overloaded with people joining as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:47">0:57:47-0:57:49</a>:</strong>  members most years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:49">0:57:49-0:57:54</a>:</strong>  Some years we refuse people because if we don't have enough crop, we use the ability<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:57:54">0:57:54-0:58:00</a>:</strong>  to balance our supply demand with the number of members we accept.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:00">0:58:00-0:58:05</a>:</strong>  So it's ranged from 25 families to a hundred families.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:05">0:58:05-0:58:12</a>:</strong>  And that's how we use to kind of balance out how much, how many people we allow to come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:12">0:58:12-0:58:14</a>:</strong>  pick is just using that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:14">0:58:14-0:58:17</a>:</strong>  So that's, it's worked pretty well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:17">0:58:17-0:58:23</a>:</strong>  It's a nice, it's a really nice model if you're in that range.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:23">0:58:23-0:58:26</a>:</strong>  And when I, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:26">0:58:26-0:58:30</a>:</strong>  Well and it seems like it solves one of the major problems that a lot of farms have, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:30">0:58:30-0:58:32</a>:</strong>  in their beginning, which is cash flowing early on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:32">0:58:32-0:58:37</a>:</strong>  A lot of times you have to wait until a harvest comes in and then slowly try and reinvest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:37">0:58:37-0:58:42</a>:</strong>  that while kind of budgeting out until you get that another cash injection from the next<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:42">0:58:42-0:58:43</a>:</strong>  harvest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:43">0:58:43-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  And especially with longer, which are in perennial systems like this, that can be difficult,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:58:52</a>:</strong>  but this way at least you get some cash upfront in the membership configuration that you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:52">0:58:52-0:58:57</a>:</strong>  use to kind of improve the system as you go, no?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:57">0:58:57-0:58:58</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:58:58">0:58:58-0:59:03</a>:</strong>  And I do recommend that people who are looking to put in an orchard or any agroforestry,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:03">0:59:03-0:59:08</a>:</strong>  anytime you're talking trees, you're talking a longer timeframe before harvesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:08">0:59:08-0:59:14</a>:</strong>  So I recommend that you start at the same time or in the same year, or even in the first<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:14">0:59:14-0:59:21</a>:</strong>  year, you start with annual productions of either vegetables and or animals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:21">0:59:21-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  And so if you buy, for example, chicks in the spring and sell them later in the summer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:25">0:59:25-0:59:32</a>:</strong>  or the fall as raised birds, that's a great way to get a nice cash flow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:32">0:59:32-0:59:37</a>:</strong>  And I recommend people look up Joel Salton's system for growing, for example, broilers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:37">0:59:37-0:59:40</a>:</strong>  or turkeys or ducks and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:40">0:59:40-0:59:48</a>:</strong>  So yes, combining the annual with the perennial because the perennial will take time and basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:48">0:59:48-0:59:54</a>:</strong>  you will be creating your market for your perennial production by your annual crops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=0:59:54">0:59:54-1:00:00</a>:</strong>  So I say, if you're good at selling and ideally if you're, let's say a couple of people and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:00">1:00:00-1:00:05</a>:</strong>  one person is great on production and one great on selling, I'd say you have a great<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:05">1:00:05-1:00:10</a>:</strong>  combination, especially if you're in that, I like to say, just look around.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:10">1:00:10-1:00:13</a>:</strong>  Does your nearby town have a McDonald's?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:13">1:00:13-1:00:19</a>:</strong>  And if it does, then you know you're within the, you're in the range because McDonald's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:19">1:00:19-1:00:26</a>:</strong>  will not put a restaurant if they don't have a big enough population close by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:29</a>:</strong>  So if there is a McDonald's, then you're good to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:29">1:00:29-1:00:31</a>:</strong>  You say, yeah, there's a McDonald's in town.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:31">1:00:31-1:00:32</a>:</strong>  Well, great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:32">1:00:32-1:00:38</a>:</strong>  Your farm will have enough people to really go well, to work well in that model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:38">1:00:38-1:00:42</a>:</strong>  But the big thing is you're no longer selling a commodity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:42">1:00:42-1:00:48</a>:</strong>  You're actually selling, you know, it's, it's, it's not, you're not competing with whatever's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:48">1:00:48-1:00:49</a>:</strong>  in the store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:49">1:00:49-1:00:54</a>:</strong>  People are going to be buying you, your brand and your farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:00:54">1:00:54-1:01:00</a>:</strong>  And that's a huge difference going from to retail compared to, you know, basically trying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:00">1:01:00-1:01:02</a>:</strong>  to sell on price, which is terrible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:02">1:01:02-1:01:05</a>:</strong>  It's a terrible model to sell on price.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:05">1:01:05-1:01:08</a>:</strong>  You become a price maker rather than a price taker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:08">1:01:08-1:01:11</a>:</strong>  And for agriculture, that's all the difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:11">1:01:11-1:01:14</a>:</strong>  Yeah, man, there's so many good things here to unpack.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:14">1:01:14-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  And I know we've only been able to go through kind of a brief overview of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:18">1:01:18-1:01:24</a>:</strong>  And so do you have resources and links and ways for people to get in contact who want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:24">1:01:24-1:01:29</a>:</strong>  to know more and dig in deeper to all of the great educational resources that you've been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:29">1:01:29-1:01:30</a>:</strong>  putting out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:30">1:01:30-1:01:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I would say depending on what stage you're at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:35">1:01:35-1:01:40</a>:</strong>  Certainly one of the easiest, if you're just interested and you want to find out more,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:40">1:01:40-1:01:43</a>:</strong>  get the film, the Permaculture Orchard Beyond Organic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:43">1:01:43-1:01:51</a>:</strong>  So you can download a version depending which version you get, it's around 10 bucks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:51">1:01:51-1:01:57</a>:</strong>  Start with that in two hours or a little more than two hours, you'll really, you won't be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:01:57">1:01:57-1:02:00</a>:</strong>  able to digest it all one go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:00">1:02:00-1:02:05</a>:</strong>  I guarantee you there's so much in there, but you will have an idea of where you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:05">1:02:05-1:02:08</a>:</strong>  going if you wanted to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:08">1:02:08-1:02:14</a>:</strong>  If you're, that's if you're really looking to start out or if you've already started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:14">1:02:14-1:02:16</a>:</strong>  and you want some details.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:16">1:02:16-1:02:22</a>:</strong>  Otherwise, if you've already got trees put in, or you want to see how you can have it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:22">1:02:22-1:02:29</a>:</strong>  diversified, we've actually kind of gone film plus and updated all the newest information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:29">1:02:29-1:02:33</a>:</strong>  we know in our virtual tour.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:33">1:02:33-1:02:39</a>:</strong>  And if you want to do, get specific on pruning, so we got a course put out called the Pruning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:39">1:02:39-1:02:40</a>:</strong>  Course.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:54">1:02:54-1:02:59</a>:</strong>  I would just say the last one would be some of the most recent, as it happens kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:02:59">1:02:59-1:03:07</a>:</strong>  information, is just on check out the YouTube channel under my name, Stefan Sapkowiak, or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:07">1:03:07-1:03:09</a>:</strong>  Instagram and Facebook.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:09">1:03:09-1:03:14</a>:</strong>  So those are kind of the places where I park whatever I'm learning or seeing or learning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:14">1:03:14-1:03:17</a>:</strong>  about and a good place to start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:17">1:03:17-1:03:18</a>:</strong>  Nice.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:24">1:03:24-1:03:26</a>:</strong>  show notes for this podcast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:26">1:03:26-1:03:30</a>:</strong>  So Stefan, it's been such a pleasure finally getting to talk to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:30">1:03:30-1:03:31</a>:</strong>  I'm a big fan of your work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:31">1:03:31-1:03:35</a>:</strong>  I really look forward to seeing what else you put out here in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:35">1:03:35-1:03:36</a>:</strong>  And thank you so much for making the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:36">1:03:36-1:03:39</a>:</strong>  I hope we can catch up again in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-stefan-sobkowiak/#t=1:03:39">1:03:39-1:03:40</a>:</strong>  I hope so too.<br />
