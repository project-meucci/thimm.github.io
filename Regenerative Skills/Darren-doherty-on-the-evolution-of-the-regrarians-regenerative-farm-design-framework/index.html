<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:32:57">0:32:57-0:33:03</a>:</strong>  And that enabled me to do what I what we did in 2007, which was what I called our interview<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:03">0:33:03-0:33:05</a>:</strong>  with the planet.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:12">0:33:12-0:33:17</a>:</strong>  So we did all of these, I'm going to say quasi keyline courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:17">0:33:17-0:33:23</a>:</strong>  And they were pretty well foundational to what we continued to do right up to the wrecks<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:30">0:33:30-0:33:37</a>:</strong>  I think we went twice this way and we went a couple of times that way, you know, up in<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:33:48">0:33:48-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  learning, you certainly get a lot closer to those landscapes than you would as a tourist,<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/darren-doherty-on-the-evolution-of-the-regrarians-regenerative-farm-design-framework/#t=0:34:53">0:34:53-0:34:54</a>:</strong>  I would say I would say the latter.<br />
