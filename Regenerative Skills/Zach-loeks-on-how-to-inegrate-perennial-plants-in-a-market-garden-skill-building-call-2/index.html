<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:04">0:16:04-0:16:07</a>:</strong>  And the triad is the unit of gill design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:07">0:16:07-0:16:09</a>:</strong>  It's a three bed unit of gill design.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:13">0:16:13-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  largest scale, I would maybe recommend five and a half to six foot wide.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:16:58">0:16:58-0:17:02</a>:</strong>  that can do the companion well for other reasons.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:10">0:17:10-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  those ideas of pest confusion, pest deterrence, you know, biodiversity benefits, improvement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:17</a>:</strong>  of soil.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:24">0:17:24-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  design around really important things, such as efficiency of harvest and accessibility.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:37</a>:</strong>  And so an example of how I start from this point of view would be that if I had three<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:37">0:17:37-0:17:44</a>:</strong>  beds in my triad, the center bed would go into a key species or a key guild.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:44">0:17:44-0:17:50</a>:</strong>  And that would usually be those plants that are the longest maturing or the largest plants,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:50">0:17:50-0:17:52</a>:</strong>  because I really want to design around them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:52">0:17:52-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  If I plant trees that have a solid stem in the middle, that bed really becomes something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:02</a>:</strong>  I can no longer drive over, but I want to be able to drive adjacent.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:08">0:18:08-0:18:14</a>:</strong>  like a dwarf cherry as the key species, and then I have other companions I find later,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:14">0:18:14-0:18:18</a>:</strong>  the adjacent bed, I want to make sure that at least one of these adjacent beds has good<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:25</a>:</strong>  harvest?<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:19:08">0:19:08-0:19:16</a>:</strong>  If I put a crop of raspberries in this other bed over here, on the sunny side, I could<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:22:59">0:22:59-0:23:00</a>:</strong>  this group before you showed up.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:13</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, you know, for irrigation, my rule of thumb is first healthy soil because healthy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:13">0:23:13-0:23:15</a>:</strong>  soil holds water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:19</a>:</strong>  So then you're better in drought and healthy soil drains.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:19">0:23:19-0:23:21</a>:</strong>  So then you're better being able to get in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:21">0:23:21-0:23:25</a>:</strong>  So first of all, by having a permanent bed system with raised permanent beds, investing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:25">0:23:25-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  in that and by integrating annuals and perennials, my beds are drier sooner when I want them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:34</a>:</strong>  drier and they stay moist longer when I want the water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:34">0:23:34-0:23:37</a>:</strong>  So that's always number one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:37">0:23:37-0:23:44</a>:</strong>  Then I go to, you know, the next layer, which is, you know, hoses and drip and sprinklers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:44">0:23:44-0:23:46</a>:</strong>  and water source and etc.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:46">0:23:46-0:23:54</a>:</strong>  And then my next thing I would say is, you know, have a system that has several backups<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:23:54">0:23:54-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  for water source.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:00">0:24:00-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  you want, but at the end of the day, it comes down to the source.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:07</a>:</strong>  How much water do you have when you need it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:07">0:24:07-0:24:12</a>:</strong>  So you know, what we have been working on, you know, on the farm and the Institute over<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:12">0:24:12-0:24:16</a>:</strong>  the years is now something that is a three source system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:16">0:24:16-0:24:23</a>:</strong>  So we have water catchment off of our barn, which collects in tanks, and that's a reserve.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:23">0:24:23-0:24:27</a>:</strong>  And then we pump from that reserve into the fields.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:35</a>:</strong>  But that system that is pumping from that tank is also connected to a well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:35">0:24:35-0:24:41</a>:</strong>  So if there is not enough water in the tank from the roof, we supplement it from the well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:41">0:24:41-0:24:45</a>:</strong>  And we're glad that it goes into the tank because we don't want to shock our plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:45">0:24:45-0:24:50</a>:</strong>  with a bunch of well water in the middle of July.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:50">0:24:50-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  They don't want that.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:24:57">0:24:57-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  to actually irrigate directly from a pond as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:06</a>:</strong>  And while irrigating from the pond, it tops up the tanks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:06">0:25:06-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  So then we're able to choose not to irrigate from the pond in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  And we've our tanks are topped up in case it hasn't been raining as well.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/zach-loeks-on-how-to-inegrate-perennial-plants-in-a-market-garden-skill-building-call-2/#t=0:25:20">0:25:20-0:25:28</a>:</strong>  around the pond so that we are balancing how much we draw from the pond while not removing<br />
