<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:15</a>:</strong>  obsessed with documentaries.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:37">0:05:37-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  would hazard a guess of 95% or more talks about the problems of the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:45</a>:</strong>  It's very, very negative.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:05:58">0:05:58-0:06:01</a>:</strong>  Falling Food, which you can watch on YouTube.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:01">0:06:01-0:06:07</a>:</strong>  It's about 50 minutes long and it's a biography of Bill Mollison, the co-founder of the concept<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:07">0:06:07-0:06:09</a>:</strong>  of permaculture.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:18">0:06:18-0:06:23</a>:</strong>  And ever since then, I mean, I just, I went the other direction and I started studying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:23">0:06:23-0:06:25</a>:</strong>  permaculture and practicing permaculture.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:35">0:06:35-0:06:41</a>:</strong>  not just a consumer, but a producer in solutions-based nonfiction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:42</a>:</strong>  Fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:42">0:06:42-0:06:47</a>:</strong>  I'm originally from Hawaii.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:47">0:06:47-0:06:51</a>:</strong>  I was born and raised there and I lived there until I was 18.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:06:59">0:06:59-0:07:00</a>:</strong>  what it was.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:05">0:07:05-0:07:14</a>:</strong>  and Fred Lobster and just all these types of businesses that we don't have on Maui.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:14">0:07:14-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  So I really wanted to leave.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:17</a>:</strong>  I wanted to move to a big city and then I did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:17">0:07:17-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  And then after I had that experience of living away and experiencing a different culture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:26</a>:</strong>  and experiencing a place where people weren't so connected to the natural world around them,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:26">0:07:26-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  Maui and all that it taught me while I grew up there became really important to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:37</a>:</strong>  And so that's where my grounding in caring for the earth really comes from, is being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:37">0:07:37-0:07:42</a>:</strong>  blessed to have been brought up in a place where nature is gorgeous all around me and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:42">0:07:42-0:07:45</a>:</strong>  makes my day better every single day, just by being around it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:45">0:07:45-0:07:50</a>:</strong>  And I've had the luck of getting to live in a lot of different places and some people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:50">0:07:50-0:07:51</a>:</strong>  just don't have that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:51">0:07:51-0:07:55</a>:</strong>  That's just not the reality of a lot of different people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:07:55">0:07:55-0:08:01</a>:</strong>  So that started really creating for me this understanding of how your reality shapes your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:01">0:08:01-0:08:02</a>:</strong>  worldview.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:02">0:08:02-0:08:10</a>:</strong>  And I like to tell a little story about this, which is if you have a fish that's swimming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:10">0:08:10-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  around and you ask that fish to describe what color of the water it is that they're swimming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:18</a>:</strong>  in, they're going to say, what water?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:18">0:08:18-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  Because they don't know they're in water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:19">0:08:19-0:08:24</a>:</strong>  It's not until that fish is possibly caught and then makes it into the non-water world<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:24">0:08:24-0:08:28</a>:</strong>  and then hopefully makes it back to its other water friends that it's going to be able to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:30</a>:</strong>  say, dude, we're swimming around in water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:30">0:08:30-0:08:32</a>:</strong>  I didn't know it was there before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:32">0:08:32-0:08:33</a>:</strong>  And that was me in Hawaii.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:33">0:08:33-0:08:37</a>:</strong>  I was swimming around in a certain water and then I had to leave and live someplace else<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:37">0:08:37-0:08:39</a>:</strong>  and then come back to it in order to understand it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:39">0:08:39-0:08:46</a>:</strong>  And that's one reason why I think the stories are really important is because when you hear<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:46">0:08:46-0:08:50</a>:</strong>  about another person's experience or you hear about another person's worldview, not even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:50">0:08:50-0:08:55</a>:</strong>  the worldview, but like actually done within an experience, it opens up my mind, opens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:08:55">0:08:55-0:09:00</a>:</strong>  up my whole being really to another way of being and doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:00">0:09:00-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  So to take that down another level, I also grew up doing theater.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:10</a>:</strong>  And theater you're quite literally putting yourself into a different storyline and living<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:17</a>:</strong>  characters and you've got lighting and costumes and stage and a bunch of different people<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:29</a>:</strong>  time when I was five, possibly earlier.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:09:37">0:09:37-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  theater there and theater was different there.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:04">0:10:04-0:10:07</a>:</strong>  okay that I was not feeling like I fit in there and like maybe I was having culture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:07">0:10:07-0:10:09</a>:</strong>  shock and maybe I actually fit back in more in Hawaii.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:10:18">0:10:18-0:10:24</a>:</strong>  an actor and going on auditions just really ground me down.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:21">0:11:21-0:11:26</a>:</strong>  And I remember that they did this exercise where they asked us, what are the most, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:26">0:11:26-0:11:30</a>:</strong>  are the memories that you have from school that you felt like you learned the most?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:30">0:11:30-0:11:33</a>:</strong>  And for every single one of us across the board, it was something experiential and something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:33">0:11:33-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  that was part of our own story.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:39">0:11:39-0:11:45</a>:</strong>  kids, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11 year olds and having them go through experiences.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:45">0:11:45-0:11:50</a>:</strong>  I remember we decided to shipwreck a bunch of kids, that was a lot of fun.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:11:56</a>:</strong>  world.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:02">0:12:02-0:12:05</a>:</strong>  started showing me all these different documentaries and things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:05">0:12:05-0:12:09</a>:</strong>  And I also, part of theater is that I understand story because I've just lived in a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:09">0:12:09-0:12:10</a>:</strong>  different stories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:10">0:12:10-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  So I understand how they kind of work on the human soul a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:15">0:12:15-0:12:19</a>:</strong>  I'm not the only one, but I'm grateful for that understanding and that perspective.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:23">0:12:23-0:12:30</a>:</strong>  how we're in this era at time of peak everything and nothing's really quite certain and there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:33</a>:</strong>  a lot of terrible things that have happened and there's a lot of terrible things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:33">0:12:33-0:12:35</a>:</strong>  still could happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:35">0:12:35-0:12:43</a>:</strong>  If you just leave people there like, oh, genocide, nothing else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:43">0:12:43-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  It doesn't make people want to engage and make a difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:50</a>:</strong>  It doesn't make people want to engage and make a change and be part of the solution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:50">0:12:50-0:12:54</a>:</strong>  And people are so busy that it takes a certain type of person that has the time and the bandwidth<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:54">0:12:54-0:12:56</a>:</strong>  to think, okay, well, what are the solutions?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:56">0:12:56-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  Let me go after them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:12:59</a>:</strong>  So instead, can we create experiences?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:12:59">0:12:59-0:13:00</a>:</strong>  Can we create content?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:00">0:13:00-0:13:07</a>:</strong>  Can we create stories that engage human resilience, resiliency of the human spirit?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:07">0:13:07-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  And so everything else I've done since there, usually under the realm, something I call<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:14</a>:</strong>  social artistry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:14">0:13:14-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  And that's a term that was coined by a woman named Jean Houston, who's a mentor of mine,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  but a lot of different people use it in a lot of different contexts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:27</a>:</strong>  It's how do you use art and creativity and story to engage people in their potential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:27">0:13:27-0:13:30</a>:</strong>  of who they can be at this time on this planet?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:30">0:13:30-0:13:35</a>:</strong>  When we are being asked to really look at ourselves and make changes so that we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:35">0:13:35-0:13:41</a>:</strong>  be living more resiliency, resiliently and regeneratively for generations to come.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:41">0:13:41-0:13:46</a>:</strong>  And so the podcast came about because I've been learning about permaculture with Laxley<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:46">0:13:46-0:13:49</a>:</strong>  and I've been learning about social artistry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:49">0:13:49-0:13:53</a>:</strong>  And these are things that if I engage somebody to sort of conversation, they wouldn't necessarily<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:53">0:13:53-0:13:54</a>:</strong>  know what I'm talking about right away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:54">0:13:54-0:13:59</a>:</strong>  Because they're kind of the concepts that require a little bit of theory and a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:13:59">0:13:59-0:14:01</a>:</strong>  bit of a world perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:01">0:14:01-0:14:08</a>:</strong>  And the best way, I think, to share that world perspective and to encourage people to think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:08">0:14:08-0:14:15</a>:</strong>  in these ways is to show and tell the stories of what it is in action and what it's done<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:15">0:14:15-0:14:20</a>:</strong>  to a community, what it's done to a piece of land, what it's done to a person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:20">0:14:20-0:14:22</a>:</strong>  And so that's where the podcast came from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:22">0:14:22-0:14:23</a>:</strong>  I love that explanation.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:26">0:14:26-0:14:32</a>:</strong>  So over the new year, we're just a couple of weeks in, I have been thinking a lot about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:32">0:14:32-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  how I want to theme or redirect this publication for the upcoming season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:43</a>:</strong>  And I was thinking about all these concepts of becoming a better listener through proactive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:43">0:14:43-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  means and learning how to ask the questions that get people to share and making them comfortable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:14:52</a>:</strong>  enough to be vulnerable and really give the information that connects with people on another<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:52">0:14:52-0:14:58</a>:</strong>  level as well as the practical information that I focused on in previous seasons.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:14:58">0:14:58-0:15:03</a>:</strong>  And a lot of that comes along with storytelling in a way to engage people and have it connect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:03">0:15:03-0:15:08</a>:</strong>  with their experience in a way that just techniques and information on its own struggles to do<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:16">0:15:16-0:15:22</a>:</strong>  the right moment while I was trying to kind of culminate and clarify some of these contexts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:22">0:15:22-0:15:31</a>:</strong>  And so tell me a little bit about the power of narrative in your own experiences and how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:31">0:15:31-0:15:38</a>:</strong>  it sort of connected you to these larger concepts of regeneration and holistic thinking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:38">0:15:38-0:15:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:39">0:15:39-0:15:48</a>:</strong>  So for me, in Spanish, the word historia means story and history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:48">0:15:48-0:15:55</a>:</strong>  So my background is in history and it's about crafting the story of the past in a sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:15:55">0:15:55-0:16:02</a>:</strong>  That said, the way that my Western linear male mind always thought was very much in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:02">0:16:02-0:16:07</a>:</strong>  terms of facts and figures and dates and whatnot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:07">0:16:07-0:16:11</a>:</strong>  And it was very, very much up in the head, although I felt like I could craft a good<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:11">0:16:11-0:16:12</a>:</strong>  story with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:12">0:16:12-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  Now, I realized later on that that was a story that would resonate with certain types of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:25</a>:</strong>  minds that were more similar to my own and it didn't have great resonance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:25">0:16:25-0:16:32</a>:</strong>  And so what I later found, especially around the year 2016 and the national conversation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:32">0:16:32-0:16:40</a>:</strong>  we were having in the United States at that time was that stories of the heart, actual<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:40">0:16:40-0:16:44</a>:</strong>  stories that tug at people's heartstrings have resonance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:44">0:16:44-0:16:51</a>:</strong>  And when you can combine those two, it has really powerful resonance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:51">0:16:51-0:16:59</a>:</strong>  And one way I want to take that question to is this lowest common denominator, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:16:59">0:16:59-0:17:03</a>:</strong>  permaculture or what have you, or facts or information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:03">0:17:03-0:17:09</a>:</strong>  We create them as humans to affect other humans and because it's part of our own story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:09">0:17:09-0:17:13</a>:</strong>  And so if you take away anything and everything, you're left with a human being.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:13">0:17:13-0:17:17</a>:</strong>  And what is a human being, but a storyteller, the way that I choose to live my life, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:17">0:17:17-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  way I choose to engage with other people, the things I choose to dress, the things I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:24</a>:</strong>  choose to watch, that's all me telling a story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:24">0:17:24-0:17:28</a>:</strong>  And even more so than narrative, because when you do become aware of what your narrative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:28">0:17:28-0:17:34</a>:</strong>  is, then you start to be able to change it, which is really powerful in a person's life<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:34">0:17:34-0:17:37</a>:</strong>  and live the life that you're wanting to live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:37">0:17:37-0:17:40</a>:</strong>  Not everybody is aware that they can even do that, but once you are aware, then you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:40">0:17:40-0:17:44</a>:</strong>  can just start making those tiny little changes as an individual.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:44">0:17:44-0:17:45</a>:</strong>  That's really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:45">0:17:45-0:17:52</a>:</strong>  The thing that I find myself teaching people with even more gusto though is the listening,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:52">0:17:52-0:17:56</a>:</strong>  because listening is, it's that other part of storytelling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:17:56">0:17:56-0:18:00</a>:</strong>  Like there is no, there is a story if somebody is not listening because maybe you're listening<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:00">0:18:00-0:18:02</a>:</strong>  to yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:02">0:18:02-0:18:07</a>:</strong>  But performance is not performance unless there's somebody receiving the performance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:07">0:18:07-0:18:11</a>:</strong>  That's actually part of the origins of the word.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:11">0:18:11-0:18:18</a>:</strong>  And so knowing how to listen is such a huge part of making change in the world because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:18">0:18:18-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  one has to listen and observe, interact, listening as a type of interaction to what is happening<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:28</a>:</strong>  now, what is actually happening, what were you saying to me?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:28">0:18:28-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  What am I saying?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:35</a>:</strong>  And can I really listen in a way and respond to you and tell you that I have heard you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:35">0:18:35-0:18:42</a>:</strong>  And that is a foundational building block to peace, to change, to transformation in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:42">0:18:42-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  the ways that I think our communities need to transform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:50</a>:</strong>  That led us to Story Bridge, which is one of the most sophisticated ways to do that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:50">0:18:50-0:18:52</a>:</strong>  that I've ever done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:52">0:18:52-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  Definitely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:58</a>:</strong>  I love that concept and I'm really excited to explore the Story Bridge even more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:18:58">0:18:58-0:19:03</a>:</strong>  Can you talk a little bit first about how one can improve at listening and do so in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:03">0:19:03-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  an active way because oftentimes listening is thought of as you just sit there and receive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:16</a>:</strong>  information or you're just a vessel that is being filled with whatever is coming in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:16">0:19:16-0:19:21</a>:</strong>  But there are active ways to listen and to actually coax out new experiences and new<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:21">0:19:21-0:19:23</a>:</strong>  communications from someone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:23">0:19:23-0:19:24</a>:</strong>  Totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:24">0:19:24-0:19:30</a>:</strong>  And what comes to mind immediately when you say that are two quick tips that I use all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:30">0:19:30-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  the time, which is if I'm listening to somebody and I want to coax out more information and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:40</a>:</strong>  maybe even guide the conversation so it's more resonant for both of us, I'll take a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:40">0:19:40-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  little bit of what I heard them say almost verbatim and then throw that out in the question<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:45</a>:</strong>  that I just said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:45">0:19:45-0:19:49</a>:</strong>  So they feel like they are listened to and then I'm moving in the other direction and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:49">0:19:49-0:19:54</a>:</strong>  I'm making it really easy for them to see the connections of the threads and like taking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:54">0:19:54-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  them along that path.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:58</a>:</strong>  It's like going to where they are in the conversation, holding their hand, being like, I see you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:19:58">0:19:58-0:20:02</a>:</strong>  and listening to where you are and hey, let's go this way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:02">0:20:02-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  That's something I'll do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:09</a>:</strong>  And perhaps even more concretely, something I'll do is a practice called deep listening,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:09">0:20:09-0:20:11</a>:</strong>  whether they know I'm doing it or not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:11">0:20:11-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  And this is particularly great if you're having a conflict with somebody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:17</a>:</strong>  We collaborate with each other.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:22">0:20:22-0:20:26</a>:</strong>  So what happens is I'll hear what their person is saying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:26">0:20:26-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  And then I will say what I heard them say back.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:35">0:20:35-0:20:40</a>:</strong>  you are frustrated because, okay, here's a concrete example of something that we did<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:40">0:20:40-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  this morning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:44</a>:</strong>  He wanted to leave the house at 9 30.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:44">0:20:44-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  I wanted to leave the house at whenever, maybe 9 30 and we did not communicate about that.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:49">0:20:49-0:20:53</a>:</strong>  And ultimately I said, like, I hear that you're frustrated because you wanted to leave the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:53">0:20:53-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  house at 9 30.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:20:59">0:20:59-0:21:03</a>:</strong>  And that was really frustrating to you because you feel like you're that we're wasting time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:03">0:21:03-0:21:06</a>:</strong>  and that we're not showing up to against our word and all those things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:06">0:21:06-0:21:08</a>:</strong>  And I understand that those things are really important to you.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:19">0:21:19-0:21:20</a>:</strong>  being validated.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:45</a>:</strong>  And then we promptly congratulated each other for being on Guatemala time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:45">0:21:45-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  There's a much more fluid concept of time here.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:52">0:21:52-0:21:55</a>:</strong>  And there is another nuance aspect to this that I really, really like as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:21:55">0:21:55-0:22:03</a>:</strong>  This telling back what you heard the other person say is giving that person space to<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:10">0:22:10-0:22:16</a>:</strong>  meant to say originally and that the cloud of whatever was in their head, you know, not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:16">0:22:16-0:22:22</a>:</strong>  having eaten or frustration or whatever didn't come through clearly that first time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:22">0:22:22-0:22:27</a>:</strong>  So giving them also that space to respond back, not just, I heard you say this opportunity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:27">0:22:27-0:22:28</a>:</strong>  for clarification.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:37</a>:</strong>  in our own story modes and our own conditionings.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:22:46">0:22:46-0:22:49</a>:</strong>  for sure that the connection of listening and understanding has happened.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:05</a>:</strong>  really listened to somebody and you really heard them, they feel like they've received<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:13</a>:</strong>  And so they're more set and primed to want to listen to you.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:17</a>:</strong>  Great.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:35</a>:</strong>  And so if I'm having a conflict and I'm not feeling heard, I can say, we don't have a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:35">0:25:35-0:25:41</a>:</strong>  conflict right now, but I would be like, okay, Oliver, I hear you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:41">0:25:41-0:25:45</a>:</strong>  I hear that you're saying this and this and this.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:25:51">0:25:51-0:25:52</a>:</strong>  I don't feel like I'm being heard.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:06">0:26:06-0:26:09</a>:</strong>  share is really important and important to us achieving our goals together.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:18</a>:</strong>  And I'm also aware that a lot of people don't know how to listen.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:32</a>:</strong>  there's clearly defined rules and there is a start and a stop and there can be a winner<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:40">0:27:40-0:27:47</a>:</strong>  business or politics by infinite parameters, infinite or sorry, by by finite parameters<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:52">0:27:52-0:27:58</a>:</strong>  So the concept of winning in business or defeating your competitors or winning in politics or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:27:58">0:27:58-0:28:01</a>:</strong>  even in relationships or communication.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:01">0:28:01-0:28:05</a>:</strong>  And instead of treating it and what I like the way that we're putting this in context<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:05">0:28:05-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  right now is that of communication and especially relationships where if you are playing a relationship<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:21</a>:</strong>  or let's say a conversation by finite rules where you're trying to get one up on the other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:28:21">0:28:21-0:28:28</a>:</strong>  person or be right or kind of make your point and then and then you win somehow.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:31">0:29:31-0:29:34</a>:</strong>  And I am a facilitator for different groups.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:37">0:29:37-0:29:41</a>:</strong>  I've learned that it's really helpful to create finite spaces within the infinite and just<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:29:50">0:29:50-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  knows about?<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:30:05">0:30:05-0:30:10</a>:</strong>  infinite situations where it's not I win, you win, but it's we both win and we keep<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:33">0:32:33-0:32:36</a>:</strong>  beyond just deep listening.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:32:38">0:32:38-0:32:40</a>:</strong>  What you usually do is you have a group of people.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:23</a>:</strong>  So we created the space for that to happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:23">0:33:23-0:33:25</a>:</strong>  So what is the story bridge?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:25">0:33:25-0:33:30</a>:</strong>  We had that group of people, that group was like 15, 16 people, but we can have groups<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:30">0:33:30-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  as large as like a hundred really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:33:35</a>:</strong>  It's scalable depending on what you're doing with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:35">0:33:35-0:33:42</a>:</strong>  And we made it the finite space in that everybody knew what the rules were in that space and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:42">0:33:42-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  like, well, the respect was a relationship, et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:51</a>:</strong>  But most importantly, we asked people to think of a personal story, a story from their own<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:33:52</a>:</strong>  personal narrative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:52">0:33:52-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  And we gave them a prompt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:33:55">0:33:55-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  That prompt for them was talk about a moment in a school garden that you saw made a huge<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  impact on a child's life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:05</a>:</strong>  Roughly that was the prompt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:05">0:34:05-0:34:08</a>:</strong>  It might've been slightly different worded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:08">0:34:08-0:34:11</a>:</strong>  And then everybody got into groups of two.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:11">0:34:11-0:34:14</a>:</strong>  So you had one person talking to another person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:14">0:34:14-0:34:16</a>:</strong>  So we had 16 people in the group.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:16">0:34:16-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  We had eight groups of two and each group of two is talking at the same time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:25</a>:</strong>  And one person goes first and the other person's the listener.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:25">0:34:25-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  And for about three minutes, the first teller would tell the story from their own personal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:36</a>:</strong>  experience based on the prompt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:36">0:34:36-0:34:40</a>:</strong>  And like the prompt is just to get people started and to get them into that general<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:40">0:34:40-0:34:43</a>:</strong>  context of, Hey, we're all talking about the same thing here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:43">0:34:43-0:34:45</a>:</strong>  It doesn't have to be specifically that prompt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:45">0:34:45-0:34:48</a>:</strong>  And we told them that too, but more concrete details.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:48">0:34:48-0:34:56</a>:</strong>  And after the first person is told their story, the listener then tells that person's story<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:34:56">0:34:56-0:35:00</a>:</strong>  back to them in the first person is if it happened to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:00">0:35:00-0:35:05</a>:</strong>  So for example, if I, if I was paired up with you, Oliver, and you were telling your story<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:05">0:35:05-0:35:10</a>:</strong>  and I happened to know that you were your first place of living was in Japan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:10">0:35:10-0:35:15</a>:</strong>  I might say when I'm telling your story back when I was a boy living in Japan, no, I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:15">0:35:15-0:35:19</a>:</strong>  not a boy, nor did I ever live in Japan, but I'm telling your story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:19">0:35:19-0:35:25</a>:</strong>  And so that becomes I, and then that person, the listener tells that story back to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:25">0:35:25-0:35:29</a>:</strong>  person who told it as if that narrative happened to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:29">0:35:29-0:35:34</a>:</strong>  And that's really cool because it really hard wires ourselves for compassion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:34">0:35:34-0:35:37</a>:</strong>  It's like hacking people to be compassionate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:37">0:35:37-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  So if you're sitting across from somebody who you might think is really different from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:47</a>:</strong>  you, and there's no win-win in with this person, if you're hearing them tell a story and you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:47">0:35:47-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  are telling that story back to them in the first person, you're going to have compassion<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:57</a>:</strong>  and empathy for that person's story just because our brains are set up that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:35:57">0:35:57-0:36:02</a>:</strong>  And here I want to give a shout out to our good friend, Ching-Hong Wei, who's also a collaborator<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:02">0:36:02-0:36:05</a>:</strong>  with us and with Richard and the Story Bridge Method.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:05">0:36:05-0:36:12</a>:</strong>  And she's actually done her PhD research on the positive community building effects of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:12">0:36:12-0:36:13</a>:</strong>  Story Bridge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:18</a>:</strong>  And there's, she has amazing examples of her dissertation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:18">0:36:18-0:36:23</a>:</strong>  And so then of course they trade places with the person who then told the person's story<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:23">0:36:23-0:36:26</a>:</strong>  back to them, tells their own personal story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:26">0:36:26-0:36:32</a>:</strong>  And then the person who was listening that time tells that story back in the first person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:32">0:36:32-0:36:35</a>:</strong>  And there's always a connection that happens there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:35">0:36:35-0:36:37</a>:</strong>  And I'm still playing with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:37">0:36:37-0:36:40</a>:</strong>  So sometimes I wonder like, okay, how much of this is a forced connection?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:40">0:36:40-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  How much of this really is an important connection?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:49</a>:</strong>  But regardless, every space I'm in where I do that with a group of people, it's kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:49">0:36:49-0:36:53</a>:</strong>  of across the board, but there's always some pairs in that group where I can hardly get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:53">0:36:53-0:36:57</a>:</strong>  them to stop talking just because they have so connected and they've so received some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:36:57">0:36:57-0:37:03</a>:</strong>  type of nutritional inspiration from each other in that experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:03">0:37:03-0:37:07</a>:</strong>  And they're like hugging or I'll see people like wiping away tears.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:07">0:37:07-0:37:12</a>:</strong>  Like it just immediately gets to that heart centered place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:12">0:37:12-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  And depending on what you're doing and about it really can help a group identify then what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:16</a>:</strong>  important to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:16">0:37:16-0:37:20</a>:</strong>  So I did it in another context where what we were doing is trying to figure out, okay,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:20">0:37:20-0:37:25</a>:</strong>  how can we as a coalition be more attractive at including other people and making people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:25">0:37:25-0:37:27</a>:</strong>  feel comfortable being a part of this coalition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:27">0:37:27-0:37:32</a>:</strong>  So I had them do a story of vision partners where they talked about a moment that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:32">0:37:32-0:37:36</a>:</strong>  felt really included in the part of the group that meant something a lot to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:36">0:37:36-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  And then after that we wrote all this together in the group saying like what needs to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:46</a>:</strong>  present for a group to feel really inclusive and really meaningful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:46">0:37:46-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  And that group had no problem just like naming out all of the different things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:55</a>:</strong>  And it was because I had them connected in their own personal narrative first, shared<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:55">0:37:55-0:37:59</a>:</strong>  that as like, oh, this is really important with another person in that space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:37:59">0:37:59-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  And then as a group, we made that brainstorm list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  So every single person was engaged in the making of that list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  So if they had just gone straight to the list, it wouldn't have come from such a heart centered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:09</a>:</strong>  place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:09">0:38:09-0:38:10</a>:</strong>  It would have come from a brain centered place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:10">0:38:10-0:38:15</a>:</strong>  And most probably all they've allowed us talkers would have contributed to the list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:15">0:38:15-0:38:21</a>:</strong>  Engage in everybody's voice too because they've now been primed to speak and to be heard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  See how important that would be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:25</a>:</strong>  So that's the first part of Story Bridge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:25">0:38:25-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  What's amazing for it is a community building tool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:32</a>:</strong>  The part I just talked about is more like a one on one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:32">0:38:32-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  But as a community building tool, then you have the group of two decide which story they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:41</a>:</strong>  feel because that group of two has told two stories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:41">0:38:41-0:38:45</a>:</strong>  They have to now choose one story that they're going to continue to tell during that story<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:45">0:38:45-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  telling session.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:50">0:38:50-0:38:53</a>:</strong>  Like it's not a win win thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:53">0:38:53-0:38:57</a>:</strong>  It's really about getting those two people to think about what is the effect of the story<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:57">0:38:57-0:38:59</a>:</strong>  on both of us?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:38:59">0:38:59-0:39:01</a>:</strong>  What is the effect of the story on this group?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:01">0:39:01-0:39:09</a>:</strong>  What story do we feel needs to be told again in order to be the most impactful in this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:09">0:39:09-0:39:12</a>:</strong>  space, to be the most healing in this space?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:12">0:39:12-0:39:14</a>:</strong>  This is a story that needs to be told.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:14">0:39:14-0:39:18</a>:</strong>  So they create a consensus amongst themselves that they're going to choose one of those<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:36">0:39:36-0:39:41</a>:</strong>  called storybridge.spaces, storybridge.spaces, where you can really learn more about the<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:45</a>:</strong>  That's Dr. Richard Gere, that's Dr. Ching Hong Wei.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:03">0:40:03-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  We're going to collaborate to create these stories.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:09">0:40:09-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  are part of this process, there's such reverence for those stories, so much love for those<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:23</a>:</strong>  there for each other that is deeply regenerative on the human aspect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:23">0:40:23-0:40:26</a>:</strong>  Yeah, this is social permaculture, without a doubt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:26">0:40:26-0:40:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:31">0:40:31-0:40:33</a>:</strong>  Um, I, yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:33">0:40:33-0:40:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah, we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:35">0:40:35-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  And before we do, I just want to tell a little story about storybridge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:39</a>:</strong>  Perfect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:39">0:40:39-0:40:40</a>:</strong>  How it can make an effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:40">0:40:40-0:40:41</a>:</strong>  It's very meta.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:41">0:40:41-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's very meta, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:48</a>:</strong>  So the first, I don't think, yeah, that's a good one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:48">0:40:48-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  So the first community that really used this process is a small community in rural Georgia<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:02</a>:</strong>  called Colquitt and Colquitt, Georgia about 25 years ago was facing when a lot of rural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:02">0:41:02-0:41:06</a>:</strong>  communities was facing in that a lot of people are moving out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:06">0:41:06-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  They used to have industry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:09</a>:</strong>  That industry was based on agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:09">0:41:09-0:41:11</a>:</strong>  The agriculture was shutting down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:11">0:41:11-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  Like there was no more industry there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:18</a>:</strong>  Urbanization was happening in terms that people were moving to urban areas and the small town<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:18">0:41:18-0:41:21</a>:</strong>  didn't know how it was going to survive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:21">0:41:21-0:41:27</a>:</strong>  And Richard Gere heard about this and he really wanted to explore the power of narrative,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:27">0:41:27-0:41:30</a>:</strong>  bringing people together on something that matters to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:30">0:41:30-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  And so he came down to Colquitt and he ultimately had people share stories and created a play<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:39</a>:</strong>  out of the stories from that community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:39">0:41:39-0:41:43</a>:</strong>  So it was really specifically based on the values that are transmitted through stories<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:43">0:41:43-0:41:47</a>:</strong>  that was important to that community in Colquitt, Georgia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:47">0:41:47-0:41:49</a>:</strong>  And it was also a very inclusive cast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:49">0:41:49-0:41:53</a>:</strong>  So when he does these things, particularly when he did it in Colquitt, Georgia and some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:53">0:41:53-0:41:59</a>:</strong>  other places too, it's a cast that included young people like the age of seven up until<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:41:59">0:41:59-0:42:01</a>:</strong>  older people the age of 90.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:01">0:42:01-0:42:05</a>:</strong>  You don't usually get that group of people and that whole spectrum of people hanging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:05">0:42:05-0:42:07</a>:</strong>  out together and doing something meaningful together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:07">0:42:07-0:42:08</a>:</strong>  But that's what this did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:08">0:42:08-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  It also included blacks and whites and anything in between in the same cast, which again,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:21</a>:</strong>  especially in that Colquitt, Georgia in the 70s, that doesn't happen very often.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:21">0:42:21-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  And all the stories are shared, all the stories are seen and they turn it into performance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:30</a>:</strong>  And the part that I love about this is that when you do this, coincidences and synchronicities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:30">0:42:30-0:42:32</a>:</strong>  can pop up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:32">0:42:32-0:42:38</a>:</strong>  And one of the coincidences and synchronicities was a little boy in that cast who was black<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:38">0:42:38-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  loved firemen and there was a fire station right across from the hall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:42:47</a>:</strong>  And so he used to just on all the breaks go and hang out right next to the fire station.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:47">0:42:47-0:42:49</a>:</strong>  So the fire chief started kind of getting to know him.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:49">0:42:49-0:42:54</a>:</strong>  He was the fire chief was really turned off to the whole story bridge idea and the creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:54">0:42:54-0:42:55</a>:</strong>  stories in theater and like, what is this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:55">0:42:55-0:42:58</a>:</strong>  No, I don't want anything to do with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:42:58">0:42:58-0:43:03</a>:</strong>  But for some reason, the fire chief ended up in the building doing one of the performances<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:03">0:43:03-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  and he was captivated and he ended up not missing another performance ever since.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:11</a>:</strong>  So like, even though he didn't think that it was something that was worth his time,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:11">0:43:11-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  just being exposed to it a little bit, he then became a very avid story bridge proponent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:21</a>:</strong>  And that little boy who was hanging out at the fire station was showing up so consistently,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:21">0:43:21-0:43:25</a>:</strong>  so consistently, so consistently that ultimately they started letting him sweep things or they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:25">0:43:25-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  started letting him show up on his bicycles with his other friends to go and fight fires<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  in the community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:30">0:43:30-0:43:35</a>:</strong>  And they were showing up with such regularity, more so than the volunteer firefighters in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:35">0:43:35-0:43:42</a>:</strong>  the village, in the town, that ultimately it led to desegregating the fire station in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:42">0:43:42-0:43:45</a>:</strong>  the community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:45">0:43:45-0:43:48</a>:</strong>  And that town, Colquitt, Georgia, still does a story bridge play every single day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:48">0:43:48-0:43:51</a>:</strong>  I mean, every single year, excuse me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:51">0:43:51-0:43:54</a>:</strong>  And they've been doing it for the last 25 years and it's created a sense of identity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:54">0:43:54-0:43:55</a>:</strong>  for that community.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:43:58">0:43:58-0:44:01</a>:</strong>  are murals of the stories that have been told during story bridge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:01">0:44:01-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  They don't call it story bridge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:03">0:44:03-0:44:08</a>:</strong>  They call it swamp gravy because that is, um, like kind of their original stone soup.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:08">0:44:08-0:44:14</a>:</strong>  It's a dish that everybody knows out in Colquitt, Georgia, where you take the leftover fish<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:14">0:44:14-0:44:18</a>:</strong>  droppings and you create a soup out of it by adding what you have on hand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:44:18">0:44:18-0:44:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:25</a>:</strong>  to kind of like stick in the gut and they often are the first one that you think of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:25">0:45:25-0:45:26</a>:</strong>  The first one that bubbles up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:26">0:45:26-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  Now you are the storyteller.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:30</a>:</strong>  You get to choose which story you want to tell.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:37">0:45:37-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  Um, I was doing a story bridge in Ashland, Oregon at a, um, transformative young leaders<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:56</a>:</strong>  training.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:03">0:46:03-0:46:06</a>:</strong>  in his life and the story bridge that they had us do that time, the prompt, like I just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:06">0:46:06-0:46:08</a>:</strong>  gave you, I had us go really deep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:08">0:46:08-0:46:14</a>:</strong>  It was like, talk about the, we started using that of force for these.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:14">0:46:14-0:46:17</a>:</strong>  And the metaphor was ultimately like, what was that time that you were so in the dark<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:17">0:46:17-0:46:21</a>:</strong>  that there was no other place for you to go except to look through the light.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:21">0:46:21-0:46:27</a>:</strong>  Um, and a friend of mine ended up telling a really personal story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:27">0:46:27-0:46:29</a>:</strong>  A lot of people did, but it was a story that he'd never shared before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:29">0:46:29-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  And it had to do with really dark parts of our culture that we don't usually talk about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:37</a>:</strong>  Um, he happened to have been sexually abused as a child.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:37">0:46:37-0:46:41</a>:</strong>  And that's the story that he told and how that that had played out in his family and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:41">0:46:41-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  family dynamics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:49</a>:</strong>  And like really deeply, like these were wounds that had turned him into who he was today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:49">0:46:49-0:46:54</a>:</strong>  And he ultimately made a choice to, um, look at that story differently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:54">0:46:54-0:46:58</a>:</strong>  But for the first time, he really shared that story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:46:58">0:46:58-0:47:01</a>:</strong>  And then he had that story shared back to him in the first person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:01">0:47:01-0:47:05</a>:</strong>  And then that was the story that was chosen to then be turned into a performance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:05">0:47:05-0:47:07</a>:</strong>  And he chose to play himself in that performance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:07">0:47:07-0:47:10</a>:</strong>  Cause when you feel a performance, you don't have to be yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:10">0:47:10-0:47:13</a>:</strong>  You could actually be the person who's the perpetrator rather than the victim or whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:13">0:47:13-0:47:14</a>:</strong>  you want to be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:14">0:47:14-0:47:16</a>:</strong>  He chose to be himself.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:28</a>:</strong>  to have happen by having the last part of that be him having a reconciliation with his<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:28">0:47:28-0:47:32</a>:</strong>  mom over all of that, which had happened, but by performing it, it became an even more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:32">0:47:32-0:47:34</a>:</strong>  real.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:34">0:47:34-0:47:40</a>:</strong>  And uh, that experience of taking something that was so deeply held within himself, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:40">0:47:40-0:47:42</a>:</strong>  so often in our culture, they're wrapped up around shame.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:42">0:47:42-0:47:43</a>:</strong>  Like you just don't share it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:43">0:47:43-0:47:46</a>:</strong>  There's just not a space for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:46">0:47:46-0:47:49</a>:</strong>  He got to share it and other people helped him share it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:49">0:47:49-0:47:55</a>:</strong>  And so suddenly that burden wasn't so heavy on him and he was able to, um, to really transform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:47:55">0:47:55-0:48:00</a>:</strong>  Um, and the phrase that came out during that process is many hands make light work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:00">0:48:00-0:48:05</a>:</strong>  So it's like many hands lifting up the story, make it not so heavy on one person and makes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:05">0:48:05-0:48:10</a>:</strong>  it more of something that the community is looking at, which is ultimately a way that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:10">0:48:10-0:48:13</a>:</strong>  you change things that you do want to have change in a community.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:19">0:48:19-0:48:20</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:20">0:48:20-0:48:21</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:21">0:48:21-0:48:27</a>:</strong>  So I have hitchhiked in a lot of different countries, but Laos was probably the one that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:27">0:48:27-0:48:29</a>:</strong>  I remember the clearest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:29">0:48:29-0:48:35</a>:</strong>  So I was traveling with a buddy of mine from Canada, both two tall gangly white kids in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:35">0:48:35-0:48:37</a>:</strong>  the middle of Laos.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:37">0:48:37-0:48:40</a>:</strong>  And we decided to hitchhike kind of on a whim.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:40">0:48:40-0:48:44</a>:</strong>  We had booked a shuttle bus to take us to a border.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:44">0:48:44-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  And it turns out like in many other places in developing countries, that bus does not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:51</a>:</strong>  leave unless it's full and nobody was coming that day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:51">0:48:51-0:48:58</a>:</strong>  So we either needed to wait for another extra day or find another way to get to the border.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:48:58">0:48:58-0:49:01</a>:</strong>  And we were like, well, we both hitchhiked before, how hard can it be?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:01">0:49:01-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  And so we stuck out our thumbs and got no ride.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:12">0:49:12-0:49:14</a>:</strong>  no, no, not like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:14">0:49:14-0:49:19</a>:</strong>  Not with your thumb out, but rather with your hand out waving towards you kind of in a downward<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:19">0:49:19-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  motion.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:27">0:49:27-0:49:30</a>:</strong>  Everybody does it because not that many people have vehicles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:30">0:49:30-0:49:31</a>:</strong>  They just don't stick out their thumbs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:31">0:49:31-0:49:33</a>:</strong>  There's a different symbol for it.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:39">0:49:39-0:49:44</a>:</strong>  and within a few minutes it became clear that the brakes didn't really work on the truck<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:44">0:49:44-0:49:49</a>:</strong>  we were in because as we started to go down the hills, the guy was like slamming on the<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:49:55">0:49:55-0:49:56</a>:</strong>  How we didn't die that time.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:07">0:50:07-0:50:11</a>:</strong>  We're going through all this gorgeous countryside forested mountain lands and all of a sudden<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:17">0:50:17-0:50:20</a>:</strong>  Because at the same time we're going through all of these small communities where it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:20">0:50:20-0:50:23</a>:</strong>  basically just little wood and thatch huts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:23">0:50:23-0:50:24</a>:</strong>  The villages were really, really basic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:24">0:50:24-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  Oh, they probably just cook with fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:31</a>:</strong>  And then there was a lot of smoke and there was even more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:31">0:50:31-0:50:37</a>:</strong>  And to the point where we pretty much couldn't see out of this open truck cab.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:37">0:50:37-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  And we kind of turned around and we could see flames off in the distance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:40">0:50:40-0:50:45</a>:</strong>  We were about to drive through a forest fire and we were not inside the truck.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:45">0:50:45-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  We were just in the open back outside, which did not seem to concern our driver in the<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:50:57">0:50:57-0:50:59</a>:</strong>  sand on it.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:07</a>:</strong>  And then after that we saw a guy with an AK-47 supervising the people who were throwing sand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:07">0:51:07-0:51:08</a>:</strong>  on the fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:08">0:51:08-0:51:14</a>:</strong>  And I was like, oh, there's probably a backstory here that I don't want to investigate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:14">0:51:14-0:51:15</a>:</strong>  Let's keep driving.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:15">0:51:15-0:51:19</a>:</strong>  And it did get pretty hot as we were driving and very smoky and tough to breathe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:19">0:51:19-0:51:25</a>:</strong>  But fortunately we got through it before it got too hot and before we started to suffocate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:25">0:51:25-0:51:26</a>:</strong>  So that was fortunate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:26">0:51:26-0:51:28</a>:</strong>  It was quite a thing to observe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:28">0:51:28-0:51:35</a>:</strong>  I still make up backstories in my head, but we finally ended up getting to the border.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:35">0:51:35-0:51:40</a>:</strong>  And just before the border was going to close, we got our visas, we got through.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:40">0:51:40-0:51:44</a>:</strong>  And the only way to get down into the nearest village was to catch a ride with one of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:44">0:51:44-0:51:48</a>:</strong>  migrant workers who sort of crossed the border regularly selling things from one side or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:48">0:51:48-0:51:49</a>:</strong>  the other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:49">0:51:49-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  And they had these big loaded up motorcycles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:51:58</a>:</strong>  So each one of us paid a motorcycle driver a bit of money to take us down the mountain<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:51:58">0:51:58-0:52:00</a>:</strong>  and into Vietnam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:00">0:52:00-0:52:06</a>:</strong>  And the conclusion that I actually have on this is borders are made up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:06">0:52:06-0:52:09</a>:</strong>  We've completely invented them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:09">0:52:09-0:52:12</a>:</strong>  They're geopolitical lines that we've drawn on a map.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:12">0:52:12-0:52:17</a>:</strong>  Sometimes they correspond with geographical features like mountain ranges or rivers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:17">0:52:17-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  And sometimes they're purely political.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  Now, though the lines themselves might be made up, over time we make them real.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:32</a>:</strong>  Crossing from forest fire unregulated Laos on dirt roads, all of a sudden everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:32">0:52:32-0:52:35</a>:</strong>  was paved, nice and clean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:35">0:52:35-0:52:39</a>:</strong>  And the towns and the settings were just completely different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:39">0:52:39-0:52:43</a>:</strong>  And this is when I kind of internalized because I had done a lot of traveling before this,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:43">0:52:43-0:52:46</a>:</strong>  but mostly it was making jumps by plane.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:46">0:52:46-0:52:51</a>:</strong>  I very rarely was crossing borders that were over land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:51">0:52:51-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  And when I was, it was in places where it wasn't extremely different, but this is when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:53:00</a>:</strong>  I realized that imaginary borders can be made real over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:00">0:53:00-0:53:04</a>:</strong>  Thank you for that story.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:19">0:53:19-0:53:21</a>:</strong>  I think I'll be okay though.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:21">0:53:21-0:53:23</a>:</strong>  That's something I love to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:23">0:53:23-0:53:24</a>:</strong>  All right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:24">0:53:24-0:53:29</a>:</strong>  So a while ago I was traveling through the country of Laos and I was traveling with a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:29">0:53:29-0:53:30</a>:</strong>  friend of mine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:30">0:53:30-0:53:38</a>:</strong>  So we're like these two big gangly white dudes traveling through Laos and we wanted to cross<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:38">0:53:38-0:53:40</a>:</strong>  the border into what country?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:40">0:53:40-0:53:41</a>:</strong>  Vietnam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:41">0:53:41-0:53:43</a>:</strong>  We wanted to cross the border into Vietnam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:43">0:53:43-0:53:50</a>:</strong>  And so we've hired a shuttle to do this and we found the shuttle and we were on the shuttle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:50">0:53:50-0:53:53</a>:</strong>  And like in many developing countries, we found that this shuttle wasn't going to leave<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:53">0:53:53-0:53:56</a>:</strong>  unless it was full of people and nobody else was coming that day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:56">0:53:56-0:53:58</a>:</strong>  So we needed a different plan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:53:58">0:53:58-0:54:02</a>:</strong>  Either we had to stay another day or we could hitchhike.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:02">0:54:02-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  So we decided to try hitchhiking and we stood on the side of the road and we stuck out our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:11</a>:</strong>  thumbs and cars kept passing and cars kept passing and nobody was picking us up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:11">0:54:11-0:54:13</a>:</strong>  And we didn't really want to think about that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:13">0:54:13-0:54:17</a>:</strong>  But then somebody told us, no, no, no, that's not how you hitchhike here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:17">0:54:17-0:54:22</a>:</strong>  How you hitchhike here is you stick out your hand and you wave towards yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:22">0:54:22-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  And within three minutes we caught a ride.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:27</a>:</strong>  Ends up that hitchhiking is super, super common in Laos.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:27">0:54:27-0:54:31</a>:</strong>  There's just a different symbol for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:31">0:54:31-0:54:38</a>:</strong>  And so we got a ride and we're riding through and maybe we've gotten multiple rides.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:38">0:54:38-0:54:43</a>:</strong>  But ultimately we ended up on a truck that didn't have very good brakes and we didn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:43">0:54:43-0:54:46</a>:</strong>  know they didn't have brakes until we started going downhill and we saw that the guy driving<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:46">0:54:46-0:54:52</a>:</strong>  had to pound on those brakes a lot and we were not slowing down like hardly at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:52">0:54:52-0:54:55</a>:</strong>  I'm still happy that I survived that one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:55">0:54:55-0:54:58</a>:</strong>  I'm not really sure how I did, but thank you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:54:58">0:54:58-0:55:03</a>:</strong>  And another thing that happened is that we started smelling smoke and we're going past<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:03">0:55:03-0:55:04</a>:</strong>  all these different villages, et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:04">0:55:04-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  And we're like, okay, maybe somebody is cooking something, but there's a lot of smoke.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:16</a>:</strong>  And ultimately we realized that we're about to go through a forest fire and that this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:16">0:55:16-0:55:20</a>:</strong>  is definitely an issue because we're not even on the inside of the vehicle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:20">0:55:20-0:55:23</a>:</strong>  Me and my friend are on the outside of the vehicle and this doesn't seem to bother the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:23">0:55:23-0:55:25</a>:</strong>  guy at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:25">0:55:25-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  And so we start driving through this forest fire and we're on the outside of the vehicle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:29">0:55:29-0:55:33</a>:</strong>  So it's super smoky and there's fire and it starts getting hotter and we see people throwing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:33">0:55:33-0:55:34</a>:</strong>  sand on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:34">0:55:34-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  And you can see somebody with an AK-47 guarding the sand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:40</a>:</strong>  Greatfully, we should have had that one too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:40">0:55:40-0:55:41</a>:</strong>  It didn't suffocate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:55:41">0:55:41-0:55:46</a>:</strong>  And when we got to the border and we crossed the border, everything changed really quickly.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:41">0:58:41-0:58:42</a>:</strong>  the statistical part of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:42">0:58:42-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  Say, for example, we have X number of people suffering from obesity or X number of people<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:49">0:58:49-0:58:57</a>:</strong>  I think that resonates with a certain type of mindset and those facts can be better bolstered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:58:57">0:58:57-0:59:00</a>:</strong>  by a real heartfelt story.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:06">0:59:06-0:59:07</a>:</strong>  community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:07">0:59:07-0:59:08</a>:</strong>  There's stacking functions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:08">0:59:08-0:59:12</a>:</strong>  That's what I like about it in a social permaculture sort of way because you have the group of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:12">0:59:12-0:59:15</a>:</strong>  people that are telling the stories and they're getting the benefit of being really listened<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:15">0:59:15-0:59:16</a>:</strong>  to.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:20">0:59:20-0:59:24</a>:</strong>  that is one of the foundational building blocks of creating changes, creating people that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:24">0:59:24-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  know how to listen.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:28">0:59:28-0:59:33</a>:</strong>  Second thing is it creates that space for people to share their narrative and have their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:33">0:59:33-0:59:39</a>:</strong>  narrative be validated and have that narrative connect for themselves in some big way in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:39">0:59:39-0:59:42</a>:</strong>  terms of what has meaning for them and what they choose to have meaning.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:44">0:59:44-0:59:48</a>:</strong>  Thirdly, the people in the space that are creating a performance together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:48">0:59:48-0:59:52</a>:</strong>  And mind you, Storybridge does not always have to be a performance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:52">0:59:52-0:59:56</a>:</strong>  Storybridge Spaces, that is always ending a performance.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=0:59:58">0:59:58-1:00:03</a>:</strong>  But the group of people that are creating the performance suddenly have bonds that weren't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:03">1:00:03-1:00:04</a>:</strong>  there before.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:08">1:00:08-1:00:10</a>:</strong>  else, which is important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:10">1:00:10-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  If you've got multiple communities coming together to tell stories, that's a beneficial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:15</a>:</strong>  thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:15">1:00:15-1:00:20</a>:</strong>  And then finally, you have them sharing these personal stories out to the wider community,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:20">1:00:20-1:00:26</a>:</strong>  which creates this space, which is a celebration as well as an investigation of things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:29</a>:</strong>  are important to that local community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:29">1:00:29-1:00:34</a>:</strong>  Or in this case, we are really investigating local food and bringing that attention and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:34">1:00:34-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  that spotlight that arts can do, that creative events can do to local food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:45</a>:</strong>  And what that is and what are the stories in our community right now, right here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:45">1:00:45-1:00:49</a>:</strong>  And those stories can be inspirational, those stories can be sad, those stories can be impactful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:49">1:00:49-1:00:50</a>:</strong>  in all the different ways that stories can be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:00:50">1:00:50-1:00:52</a>:</strong>  But it's very real and very authentic.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:20">1:01:20-1:01:21</a>:</strong>  up for him.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:32">1:01:32-1:01:36</a>:</strong>  And this process is a series of seeds that you can go and sow.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:42">1:01:42-1:01:44</a>:</strong>  in her research, that of empathy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:44">1:01:44-1:01:51</a>:</strong>  When I go in the either in the telling the story back in the first person and in addition<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:01:56">1:01:56-1:02:03</a>:</strong>  performance, that embodiment of that story that exists in that room, we're not talking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:03">1:02:03-1:02:08</a>:</strong>  about some far off Greek god, we're talking about this person in front of you that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:08">1:02:08-1:02:13</a>:</strong>  now know, you can see, you can smell, you can touch, etc.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:13">1:02:13-1:02:20</a>:</strong>  I, in a sense, lived their story in that enactment that we do in the story bridge process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:20">1:02:20-1:02:26</a>:</strong>  And that for me, cultivated such a sense of great sense of empathy for that other person<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:26">1:02:26-1:02:35</a>:</strong>  that I have found very, very, very difficult in all other aspects of my life and my culture<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:39">1:02:39-1:02:44</a>:</strong>  It's a process where my story becomes our story and the our story happens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:44">1:02:44-1:02:50</a>:</strong>  And in certain cases, when you can have a really strong our story, our mission, our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:50">1:02:50-1:02:55</a>:</strong>  vision, what is important to us, that is what can keep the ducks flying in the formation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:55">1:02:55-1:02:59</a>:</strong>  and moving towards the same direction at the same time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:02:59">1:02:59-1:03:05</a>:</strong>  And Ching Hong Wei as well, she did her PhD dissertation on the Colquitt, Georgia, that<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:09">1:03:09-1:03:15</a>:</strong>  And her dissertation proved in the ways that social sciences like to prove things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:15">1:03:15-1:03:22</a>:</strong>  it was an urban planning and urban development, that Colquitt, Georgia had more resiliency<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:23">1:03:23-1:03:27</a>:</strong>  She had more benchmarks of how she was measuring the resiliency than other small towns of its<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:27">1:03:27-1:03:31</a>:</strong>  size, of its similar history that were around it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:31">1:03:31-1:03:34</a>:</strong>  And a lot of that had to do with the coming together and telling stories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:34">1:03:34-1:03:35</a>:</strong>  I can imagine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:35">1:03:35-1:03:40</a>:</strong>  Now, before we wrap things up, because I've got to attend to a few things on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:40">1:03:40-1:03:46</a>:</strong>  Talk to me a little bit about how one can invite more storytelling and better listening<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:46">1:03:46-1:03:48</a>:</strong>  in their own lives.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:48">1:03:48-1:03:52</a>:</strong>  That's a good question, my friend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:03:52">1:03:52-1:04:00</a>:</strong>  So Rhapsody is really, in my mind, a wealth of knowledge on a lot of different techniques,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:00">1:04:00-1:04:02</a>:</strong>  including story bridge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:02">1:04:02-1:04:08</a>:</strong>  And I would first and foremost reiterate giving space for story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:08">1:04:08-1:04:13</a>:</strong>  And like you were mentioning to me earlier today, building a table, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:13">1:04:13-1:04:21</a>:</strong>  So having a physical space, obviously, for story, but then also the meal is a place for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:21">1:04:21-1:04:27</a>:</strong>  a powerful place for a story that you don't even necessarily have to have some fancy advanced<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:27">1:04:27-1:04:32</a>:</strong>  technique or go to a training on how to do just serve somebody a meal or have a meal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:32">1:04:32-1:04:36</a>:</strong>  with another person and sit across from them and the stories will emerge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:36">1:04:36-1:04:41</a>:</strong>  So having a physical space and a temporal space for it, I think is the first key that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:41">1:04:41-1:04:42</a>:</strong>  anybody can take.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:42">1:04:42-1:04:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:43">1:04:43-1:04:47</a>:</strong>  And to add to that a couple more things, definitely creating a space for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:47">1:04:47-1:04:50</a>:</strong>  When you're telling stories, you're creating culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:50">1:04:50-1:04:55</a>:</strong>  And one way that you can do that is by repeating certain stories that are important to your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:55">1:04:55-1:04:57</a>:</strong>  mission and vision of whatever it is you're creating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:04:57">1:04:57-1:05:01</a>:</strong>  So Grand Hasekim, for example, or Abundant Edge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:01">1:05:01-1:05:06</a>:</strong>  If you have a story of something that's happened here that is really like just a great story<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:06">1:05:06-1:05:10</a>:</strong>  at depicting and sharing the experience of the values that you hold dear here, share<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:10">1:05:10-1:05:15</a>:</strong>  that story, share that story, share that story amongst each other, amongst any person that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:15">1:05:15-1:05:16</a>:</strong>  comes to your farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:16">1:05:16-1:05:22</a>:</strong>  So that story starts to identify with your organization in a way that you can just go<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:22">1:05:22-1:05:26</a>:</strong>  a little bit deeper and help people connect to what you're doing here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:26">1:05:26-1:05:30</a>:</strong>  So that's one way you can do it to create more of a cultural vision.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:30">1:05:30-1:05:36</a>:</strong>  The other way that you can do it is to create that space within the rhythm of a week for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:36">1:05:36-1:05:38</a>:</strong>  there to be shared stories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:38">1:05:38-1:05:46</a>:</strong>  So one way I've seen some families do it is, and I personally really like, is sharing that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:46">1:05:46-1:05:47</a>:</strong>  moment of impact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:47">1:05:47-1:05:50</a>:</strong>  That's not what I mean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:50">1:05:50-1:05:54</a>:</strong>  Sharing like a highlight of your week and have it be a practice of sharing a highlight<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:54">1:05:54-1:05:55</a>:</strong>  of your week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:55">1:05:55-1:05:56</a>:</strong>  Some people like to call it peaks and valleys.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:56">1:05:56-1:05:58</a>:</strong>  Some people like to call it roses and thorns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:05:58">1:05:58-1:06:03</a>:</strong>  We actually did that with Laksu's family over the Christmas holiday.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:03">1:06:03-1:06:08</a>:</strong>  We were sitting there and eating Christmas dinner and we had everybody go around and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:08">1:06:08-1:06:14</a>:</strong>  share what was the things that you want to celebrate about 2018 and every single person<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:14">1:06:14-1:06:19</a>:</strong>  went around and just shared a little bit and it wasn't a full developed story, but it absolutely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:19">1:06:19-1:06:22</a>:</strong>  gave me more inkling into what's going on with these people who maybe I only see once<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:22">1:06:22-1:06:23</a>:</strong>  a year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:23">1:06:23-1:06:29</a>:</strong>  And you can do that on a weekly basis, like just creating that space to really listen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:29">1:06:29-1:06:30</a>:</strong>  to those stories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:30">1:06:30-1:06:34</a>:</strong>  And even small little, I guess you would say finite structures, putting it to there and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:34">1:06:34-1:06:37</a>:</strong>  having a clear basis of rules beforehand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:37">1:06:37-1:06:42</a>:</strong>  Like we said, okay, we're going to go clockwise and everybody's going to get a chance to speak.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:42">1:06:42-1:06:48</a>:</strong>  And there was just a minimal amount of facilitation when one person was starting to cross talk<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:48">1:06:48-1:06:51</a>:</strong>  over another, it's like, okay, now it's this person's turn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:51">1:06:51-1:06:57</a>:</strong>  And that didn't happen very often, but sometimes a little bit of structure and giving people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:57">1:06:57-1:06:59</a>:</strong>  a heads up too, you know, it helps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:06:59">1:06:59-1:07:06</a>:</strong>  And then we went around and we did what are you most excited about for 2019 for example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:06">1:07:06-1:07:09</a>:</strong>  And it gives us things to connect in with those people about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:09">1:07:09-1:07:15</a>:</strong>  And one more when it comes to your group of people working on something together, making<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:15">1:07:15-1:07:18</a>:</strong>  cultural norms explicit is really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:18">1:07:18-1:07:22</a>:</strong>  And I think that that's particularly important for that deep listening exercise that I talked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:22">1:07:22-1:07:23</a>:</strong>  about before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:23">1:07:23-1:07:27</a>:</strong>  And like next time that you have a group meeting with a group of people that you want there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:27">1:07:27-1:07:33</a>:</strong>  to be more listening, introduce that practice and say, I think listening can really help<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:33">1:07:33-1:07:36</a>:</strong>  us achieve our goals together so we can really know that we're being seen and heard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:36">1:07:36-1:07:40</a>:</strong>  I learned this way of doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:40">1:07:40-1:07:44</a>:</strong>  Can we practice this real quick so that we can try it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:44">1:07:44-1:07:49</a>:</strong>  And so then you invite somebody in your group to talk about what's on their mind for two<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:49">1:07:49-1:07:54</a>:</strong>  minutes and then you repeat back to them, not I, but just what I heard you say is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:54">1:07:54-1:07:58</a>:</strong>  you've been working on this and this and this, and that this is a challenge that you're facing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:07:58">1:07:58-1:08:00</a>:</strong>  and that this is something that's going really well for you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:00">1:08:00-1:08:05</a>:</strong>  And then give that person a chance to reflect back on anything else that maybe you've missed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-loxley-and-rhapsody-of-the-story-connective/#t=1:08:05">1:08:05-1:08:11</a>:</strong>  And then you've showed people what listening is and you're inviting people to be part of<br />
