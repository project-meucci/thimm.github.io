<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:14</a>:</strong>  cropping.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:17">0:36:17-0:36:21</a>:</strong>  And these are really flat lands as well.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:36:58">0:36:58-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  seeing is interesting is that a lot of rangeland is actually deficient in sodium.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  And the reason for that is very old landscapes have leached out and put that into these depressions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:37:08">0:37:08-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  So we see areas that have gone alkaline.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:32</a>:</strong>  well in that context, and you've mentioned some of them, Mark, and then people try and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:41:32">0:41:32-0:41:37</a>:</strong>  take that exact program and transplant it and put it on their place at huge expense<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:15">0:54:15-0:54:19</a>:</strong>  One being people thinking, oh, that doesn't affect me here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/how-to-repair-the-hydrological-cycle-of-a-landscape-expert-panel-7/#t=0:54:19">0:54:19-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  Until the fire is at their doorstep, they are not thinking about water.<br />
