<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:01">0:02:01-0:02:04</a>:</strong>  Ya in the highlands of Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:04">0:02:04-0:02:07</a>:</strong>  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:15</a>:</strong>  who worked for slave wages on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:15">0:02:15-0:02:19</a>:</strong>  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:19">0:02:19-0:02:22</a>:</strong>  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:22">0:02:22-0:02:27</a>:</strong>  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:27">0:02:27-0:02:31</a>:</strong>  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:31">0:02:31-0:02:34</a>:</strong>  it and create a better life for their families.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:02:34">0:02:34-0:02:38</a>:</strong>  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:44">0:03:44-0:03:50</a>:</strong>  intensity of the wildfires that have dominated current events around this increasingly extended<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:50">0:03:50-0:03:55</a>:</strong>  fire season that affects more and more acreage especially in the western United States every<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:55">0:03:55-0:03:56</a>:</strong>  year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:04:01</a>:</strong>  Eric explains how fire can actually be a regenerative force for the ecology of many forests, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:05</a>:</strong>  how the indigenous people of the western United States have managed fires strategically for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:05">0:04:05-0:04:07</a>:</strong>  thousands of years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:11</a>:</strong>  We talk about how communities can work together to manage the risks of their ecosystems and<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:15">0:04:15-0:04:19</a>:</strong>  We also explore some of the wisdom and lessons that Eric has learned in more than 20 years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:19">0:04:19-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  running his permaculture landscaping business, and the challenges of meeting clients' needs<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:28">0:04:28-0:04:31</a>:</strong>  Like many of the more seasoned and experienced professionals that I've had the pleasure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:31">0:04:31-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  of speaking to on this show, Eric shies away from making specific recommendations for techniques<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:40</a>:</strong>  or designs, and rather encourages people to cultivate a deeper understanding of their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:40">0:04:40-0:04:47</a>:</strong>  place and context before making assumptions about how to manage their land or even businesses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:04:51</a>:</strong>  This is a great episode for people looking to better understand fire-prone ecologies,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:51">0:04:51-0:04:55</a>:</strong>  but also for people who enjoy the challenge of considering a deeper understanding of their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:55">0:04:55-0:04:58</a>:</strong>  relationship to natural systems in general.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:04:58">0:04:58-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  So before I give it all away, I'll hand things over now to Eric.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:02">0:05:02-0:05:04</a>:</strong>  Hey Eric!<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:04">0:05:04-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  It's so great to be talking to you again!<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  How have you been?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:07</a>:</strong>  I've been great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:07">0:05:07-0:05:09</a>:</strong>  Thanks so much for having me back on the show.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:09">0:05:09-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  Hey, it's my pleasure, and I'm also really glad that you recovered from your neck injury<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  recently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:18</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that was a strange one, but here we are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:18">0:05:18-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  Here we are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:19">0:05:19-0:05:23</a>:</strong>  So rather than having you talk about your background the way we did last time, I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:23">0:05:23-0:05:26</a>:</strong>  going to refer people back to that original episode where you explained a lot about how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:26">0:05:26-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  you started out as an activist and then started to realize that you could be more effective<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:34</a>:</strong>  in the private sector.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:34">0:05:34-0:05:40</a>:</strong>  But let's talk today about some things that are very relevant to your place and time on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:44</a>:</strong>  the coastal area of California, and that's the subject of fires.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:44">0:05:44-0:05:50</a>:</strong>  Especially in the last couple of years, they have kind of compounded based on some things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:50">0:05:50-0:05:53</a>:</strong>  that have happened with drought and rain cycles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:53">0:05:53-0:05:59</a>:</strong>  Can you give us a little bit of a context as to how we're dealing with fire landscapes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:05:59">0:05:59-0:06:02</a>:</strong>  and how it's changed over the last couple of decades?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:02">0:06:02-0:06:08</a>:</strong>  Absolutely, and I'll just note that even right at this moment when I look to the north, normally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:08">0:06:08-0:06:14</a>:</strong>  I have a view of the mountains and currently as of this morning, it's totally smoked in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:14">0:06:14-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  from a fire that's happening in southern Oregon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:25</a>:</strong>  So smoke travels a very long way, and this is becoming the norm here in California.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:25">0:06:25-0:06:32</a>:</strong>  We all have our respirator masks near and ready, a few times over the last couple of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:32">0:06:32-0:06:40</a>:</strong>  years I might go out to work and by the time I come home, it's smoke and it's ash and we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:40">0:06:40-0:06:42</a>:</strong>  stuck inside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:42">0:06:42-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  In fact, even the school districts and my kids who are in middle school, we now have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  school days that are closed, schools closed on smoke days, and schools are now preparing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:01</a>:</strong>  each year to close extra days every year due to smoke.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:01">0:07:01-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  So this is becoming a normalized situation and it's really increased just in the last<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:13</a>:</strong>  few years, really since the major drought hit, which was about five years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:13">0:07:13-0:07:20</a>:</strong>  We went into a major drought, which currently is not the current situation due to the heavy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:20">0:07:20-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  rains we had this last winter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  Most reservoirs and lakes are at capacity and snowpack is thick, but it's all exacerbated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:36</a>:</strong>  by the changing in climate, the heating of the planet, the shifting of water temperature<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:36">0:07:36-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  in the ocean and the way that that affects wind currents, and these events are getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:42</a>:</strong>  more and more extreme.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:42">0:07:42-0:07:50</a>:</strong>  And they're also compounded by the fact that we have a boring beetle infestation in many<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:50">0:07:50-0:07:51</a>:</strong>  of our forests.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:51">0:07:51-0:07:57</a>:</strong>  So because of the drought, the boring beetle, they're the beetles that go in there and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:07:57">0:07:57-0:08:04</a>:</strong>  can basically kill the tree even just in one year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:09</a>:</strong>  During the drought years, they spread very fast, they reproduce very quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:09">0:08:09-0:08:16</a>:</strong>  So a lot of different aspects to what's kind of set up this crisis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:16">0:08:16-0:08:22</a>:</strong>  And another part of the crisis and probably where it all began was when we shifted our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:22">0:08:22-0:08:28</a>:</strong>  relationship with fire maybe about 100 years ago from a relationship that the native people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:35</a>:</strong>  of these lands have always had, which is that fire is a regenerative tool to renew the land<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:35">0:08:35-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  versus what Western culture has been doing the last 100 years, which is suppressing fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:52</a>:</strong>  And what's happened is the forests have become congested, congested with dead and dying wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:52">0:08:52-0:08:58</a>:</strong>  The number of trees per acre has increased tenfold, hundredfold in some places.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:08:58">0:08:58-0:09:00</a>:</strong>  And this is what we call fuel load.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:00">0:09:00-0:09:07</a>:</strong>  And this fuel load, once it ignites, the fires burn quickly up into the canopy of the forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:07">0:09:07-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  And once the canopy erupts, we've got embers and firestorms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:17</a>:</strong>  And we've seen the news over the last few years and we've seen the devastating effect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:17">0:09:17-0:09:19</a>:</strong>  that has on communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:19">0:09:19-0:09:22</a>:</strong>  So this is the new normal in the West.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:22">0:09:22-0:09:31</a>:</strong>  And the beautiful aspect of this is that cities and counties and governments and the citizenry<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:31">0:09:31-0:09:39</a>:</strong>  is waking up to not only the crisis, but the context that we've been talking about here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:39">0:09:39-0:09:48</a>:</strong>  And there are some very promising new processes like here in my county, Sonoma County, we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:48">0:09:48-0:09:56</a>:</strong>  got hit by the big fire in 2017, the Tubbs fire, which burned over 5,000 structures and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:56">0:09:56-0:09:58</a>:</strong>  had a devastating effect on our community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:09:58">0:09:58-0:10:02</a>:</strong>  And now the county is, we're doing prescribed burns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:02">0:10:02-0:10:05</a>:</strong>  I was down at my local park just the other day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:05">0:10:05-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  There's sheep in there grazing on public lands right now to mitigate fuel load.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:17</a>:</strong>  So there's a lot of positive action being taken place from an ecological point of view<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:17">0:10:17-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  that hopefully will be the growing trend throughout all of our communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:26</a>:</strong>  And we can really kind of get to the next stage of managing these.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:26">0:10:26-0:10:27</a>:</strong>  That's really encouraging to hear.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:27">0:10:27-0:10:32</a>:</strong>  I know when I started to learn more about this after some of the devastating fires of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:32">0:10:32-0:10:38</a>:</strong>  the previous years, a lot of the conclusions that I had read about, including through your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:38">0:10:38-0:10:42</a>:</strong>  blog, were somewhat counterintuitive from what I might have guessed otherwise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:42">0:10:42-0:10:46</a>:</strong>  Because the last one that you mentioned, it was the Tubbs fire?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:46">0:10:46-0:10:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:47">0:10:47-0:10:53</a>:</strong>  In 2017, came after the rain sort of returned after a drought period.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:53">0:10:53-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  And I thought that that was going to be more of a help in preventing large fires like this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:07</a>:</strong>  But it caused a lot of underbrush growth very rapidly in an area that had previously been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:07">0:11:07-0:11:10</a>:</strong>  sort of stunted because of the lack of moisture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:10">0:11:10-0:11:14</a>:</strong>  And when the summer came back in, there was that much more, like you said, fuel load for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:14">0:11:14-0:11:21</a>:</strong>  fires which had not been managed sort of periodically and in a controlled fashion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:21">0:11:21-0:11:25</a>:</strong>  And these types of things kind of start to accumulate again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:25">0:11:25-0:11:32</a>:</strong>  And also the introduction of non-native species, specifically, I believe it's eucalyptus trees,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:32">0:11:32-0:11:37</a>:</strong>  and how much those can add to large fires.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:37">0:11:37-0:11:43</a>:</strong>  Can you talk about some of these other things that are perhaps, I guess, non-intuitive or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:43">0:11:43-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  could be contradictory to most people's thinking about how fires come about and perhaps are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  managed?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:11:50</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:50">0:11:50-0:11:58</a>:</strong>  I mean, the first point there about the increase in underbrush relative to heavy rains, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:11:58">0:11:58-0:12:01</a>:</strong>  was a big issue.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:01">0:12:01-0:12:05</a>:</strong>  And it's kind of this perfect storm that happens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:05">0:12:05-0:12:12</a>:</strong>  And one of my native friends, Redbird, taught me a lot about this after the Tubbs fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:12">0:12:12-0:12:21</a>:</strong>  A lot about how when you have that heavy winter with a lot of spring growth, and then you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:21">0:12:21-0:12:27</a>:</strong>  have a hot summer, and then you get what we might call the Diablo winds or in Southern<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:27">0:12:27-0:12:33</a>:</strong>  California they might call them the Santa Ana winds, which are an eastern wind that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:33">0:12:33-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  is pulling warm, dry air from inland areas and blowing across the land, blowing this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:43</a>:</strong>  hot air, almost like a blow dryer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:43">0:12:43-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  That is this combination that creates these firestorms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:51</a>:</strong>  And one of the things that Redbird taught me was that actually the native communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:51">0:12:51-0:12:56</a>:</strong>  here in this area literally have a word for that wind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:12:56">0:12:56-0:13:03</a>:</strong>  And that word has been passed down generation after generation for 10,000 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:03">0:13:03-0:13:07</a>:</strong>  And they actually have a name for each one of these fires.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:07">0:13:07-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  I think this is an important point that I think a lot of folks don't realize is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  a lot of the fire zones where these big fires are happening, while the scale and speed and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:27</a>:</strong>  devastation is unprecedented because of the fuel load and human development and fire suppression<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:27">0:13:27-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  and all these things, the fires themselves, the locations and the fact that they are erupting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:38</a>:</strong>  is not a new precedent at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:38">0:13:38-0:13:42</a>:</strong>  In fact, native people have been tracking these fires for 10,000 years to the point<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:42">0:13:42-0:13:45</a>:</strong>  they actually have names for these fires.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:45">0:13:45-0:13:52</a>:</strong>  So one of the illusions we have to dispel is that one, that we can stop the fire from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:52">0:13:52-0:13:53</a>:</strong>  coming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:53">0:13:53-0:13:56</a>:</strong>  We just need to let go of that notion 100% complete.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:13:56">0:13:56-0:14:04</a>:</strong>  We're not going to stop fire from coming into a ecological system that has evolved with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:04">0:14:04-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  fire for tens of thousands of years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  Those are natural phenomenons, just like a geyser would be a natural phenomenon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:17</a>:</strong>  And so it's just about the time intervals of understanding when these megafires, what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:17">0:14:17-0:14:18</a>:</strong>  the history?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:18">0:14:18-0:14:23</a>:</strong>  And that's where we need to look to our native communities to learn and understand what the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:23">0:14:23-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  history of these fires are beyond our Western records and back into those deeper land-based<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:34</a>:</strong>  knowledge of these fires.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:34">0:14:34-0:14:39</a>:</strong>  So for one, we can't stop the fires from coming, but they are unprecedentedly huge and devastating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:39">0:14:39-0:14:43</a>:</strong>  because of the context.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:43">0:14:43-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  And we want to be aware of the buildup of fuel load.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  We want to be aware of the patterns of climate so that we can really predict when an area<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:14:57</a>:</strong>  is going to go up in flames.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:14:57">0:14:57-0:15:00</a>:</strong>  And it's actually not as hard as it sounds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:00">0:15:00-0:15:06</a>:</strong>  If we take the time to learn the story of place and we take the time to understand a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:06">0:15:06-0:15:11</a>:</strong>  bit more about the role that fire has in the community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:11">0:15:11-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  And another piece that I think is kind of paradoxical or that we may not understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:23</a>:</strong>  is that after a fire comes through, that doesn't actually mean that that area that was burned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:23">0:15:23-0:15:26</a>:</strong>  is now safe from a fire again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:26">0:15:26-0:15:33</a>:</strong>  In fact, we're noticing in some areas after the Tubbs fire in Santa Rosa that some of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:33">0:15:33-0:15:40</a>:</strong>  those areas are growing up very, very thick with Scotch Broom, which is an invasive opportunistic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:40">0:15:40-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  plant in our area, and other plants that will go up in flames pretty quickly, very flashy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:47</a>:</strong>  fuel loads.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:47">0:15:47-0:15:50</a>:</strong>  And they're growing in very thick and very congested.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:50">0:15:50-0:15:55</a>:</strong>  And when I consult with the fire ecologists about this, they say, yeah, really we should<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:15:55">0:15:55-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  be prescribed burning those zones the next year after the first big wildfire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:06</a>:</strong>  So as we start to unpack what it means to be in a relationship with fire and to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:06">0:16:06-0:16:13</a>:</strong>  this, first and foremost is that we need fire in these ecologies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:13">0:16:13-0:16:23</a>:</strong>  And so we need to sort of embrace its role and then control this intensity by using prescribed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:23">0:16:23-0:16:30</a>:</strong>  burn strategies to burn these areas at the right time of year in a controlled manner<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:30">0:16:30-0:16:37</a>:</strong>  that will help manage these fuels and help that regrowth, help manage that regrowth in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:37">0:16:37-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  such a way that we're not just allowing another massive fuel load growth to happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  And one more example, we're kind of waiting for an area near where I live, the hills of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:16:57</a>:</strong>  Casa Deiro, sort of like that's due to burn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:16:57">0:16:57-0:17:03</a>:</strong>  There was a big fire there in 1978 or 79 that burned those ridges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:03">0:17:03-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  When you go into those, when you go look at that forest now, it's highly congested with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:13</a>:</strong>  tannic, a lot of dying tannic, and it's just ripe for burning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:13">0:17:13-0:17:18</a>:</strong>  And part of the issue there is that all that sprouted up really dense and thick after that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:18">0:17:18-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  last big fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:26</a>:</strong>  So these aren't things that are going to go away, and it's really a year by year management.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:26">0:17:26-0:17:31</a>:</strong>  It's not like we can just wait 10 years to look at these systems again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:31">0:17:31-0:17:38</a>:</strong>  So we really have to incorporate into how we manage our landscapes, how we develop,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:40</a>:</strong>  how we build our communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:40">0:17:40-0:17:46</a>:</strong>  Fire has to have a place inside if we want to live in these ecologies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:46">0:17:46-0:17:50</a>:</strong>  Let's go back to something that you said a minute ago about how fires can be managed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:50">0:17:50-0:17:56</a>:</strong>  for the regeneration of landscapes and how right after one of these burns occurs, right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:17:56">0:17:56-0:18:01</a>:</strong>  now there are opportunistic or some would call them invasive species originally from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:07</a>:</strong>  other parts of the world that are finding niches in these damaged or disturbed ecosystem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:07">0:18:07-0:18:10</a>:</strong>  and kind of running amuck.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:10">0:18:10-0:18:16</a>:</strong>  How can those either be leveraged for something positive or replaced by something further<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:16">0:18:16-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  along in the succession to restore a healthy ecosystem over the ashes of the disturbed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:25</a>:</strong>  landscape?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:25">0:18:25-0:18:33</a>:</strong>  So the first thing that we need to realize is that these fires and the vegetative growth<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:33">0:18:33-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  that follows them is going to be different from ridge to ridge and valley to valley.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  So it makes it more complex and it causes us to become real people of the land because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  there really is not one prescription that is, you know, there's not a one size fits<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:54</a>:</strong>  all approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:18:54">0:18:54-0:19:00</a>:</strong>  And so we really have to take the time to read each ridge and each valley to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:00">0:19:00-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  what's going to be the appropriate response to that particular zone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:08</a>:</strong>  Like some areas have the Scotch broom growing up thick and other areas are just full of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:08">0:19:08-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  native bunch grasses of wildflowers and the beauty of what the fire has brought to those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:18</a>:</strong>  areas is really apparent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:18">0:19:18-0:19:23</a>:</strong>  So first off, let's just remember that one of the roles that fire, fires are what we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:23">0:19:23-0:19:26</a>:</strong>  might call a regenerative disturbance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:26">0:19:26-0:19:30</a>:</strong>  It's actually one of the great nutrient cyclers of the ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:30">0:19:30-0:19:35</a>:</strong>  When a fire rolls through it changes the pH.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:35">0:19:35-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  It produces a lot of potassium, potash, so it's one of the ways that we actually renew<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:42</a>:</strong>  potassium in the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:42">0:19:42-0:19:46</a>:</strong>  It takes out a lot of dead and diseased species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:46">0:19:46-0:19:53</a>:</strong>  So kind of cleans the slate from a disease point of view.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:53">0:19:53-0:19:59</a>:</strong>  And many of the species, the native species, actually need fire to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:19:59">0:19:59-0:20:04</a>:</strong>  Many seeds need the heat in order to sprout.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:04">0:20:04-0:20:10</a>:</strong>  So a lot of the land has evolved with fire and when the fire comes through these beautiful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:10">0:20:10-0:20:14</a>:</strong>  processes can take place where new diverse species sprout.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:14">0:20:14-0:20:18</a>:</strong>  They've been waiting for fire now that's their chance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:18">0:20:18-0:20:23</a>:</strong>  Where the strong healthy plants that were able to burn back in the fire and they have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:23">0:20:23-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  those deep root systems, they can now sprout with space and grow and thrive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:29">0:20:29-0:20:33</a>:</strong>  So these are some of the benefits and that we get that nutrient load and that potassium<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:33">0:20:33-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  and all that nutrient cycling is great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:37">0:20:37-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  So we've got to take each zone and look at the benefits or effects of fire in that zone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  and then help manage for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:20:56</a>:</strong>  So then the other aspect of that is well then how do we as a species, as major changers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:20:56">0:20:56-0:21:03</a>:</strong>  of the environment, how do we show up for this and how do we manage the new growth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:03">0:21:03-0:21:08</a>:</strong>  And so some of the tools in the toolkit here are managed grazing is definitely a tool in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:08">0:21:08-0:21:09</a>:</strong>  the toolkit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:09">0:21:09-0:21:13</a>:</strong>  And we have to remember that a lot of these ecosystems evolved for tens of thousands of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:13">0:21:13-0:21:23</a>:</strong>  years with elk, antelope, bear and these species are no longer thriving in these ecosystems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:23">0:21:23-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  and they were fuel load managers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  So one of the things that we can do right off the bat is use our domesticated animal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:41</a>:</strong>  patterns of sheep, goats, cows in a managed rotational holistic way to mimic the patterns<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:41">0:21:41-0:21:45</a>:</strong>  of elk and antelope and bear to help reduce fuel loads.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:45">0:21:45-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  So that's one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:53</a>:</strong>  The other one specific about the invasive species and one of my friends and mentors,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:53">0:21:53-0:21:59</a>:</strong>  Penny Livingston, she's made a really good point on this which is that a lot of these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:21:59">0:21:59-0:22:03</a>:</strong>  opportunistic invasive species are really functional.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:03">0:22:03-0:22:12</a>:</strong>  They're species that we could harvest for our own fuel, for our own fiber needs, our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:12">0:22:12-0:22:13</a>:</strong>  own building needs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:13">0:22:13-0:22:16</a>:</strong>  Some of them are medicinal, some of them are edible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:16">0:22:16-0:22:24</a>:</strong>  And we've talked at length about a intensive management of these invasive plants, not through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:24">0:22:24-0:22:28</a>:</strong>  a demonistic viewpoint that, oh, these are horrible, these are bad, we got to get rid<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:28">0:22:28-0:22:29</a>:</strong>  of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:29">0:22:29-0:22:33</a>:</strong>  Let's just bomb them with glyphosate and kill them off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:37</a>:</strong>  But more from the point of view of what functions and uses do they have in our communities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:37">0:22:37-0:22:39</a>:</strong>  What kinds of resources can they provide us?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:39">0:22:39-0:22:46</a>:</strong>  And if we look at them from the resource lens, now we have species we can harvest heavily<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:46">0:22:46-0:22:53</a>:</strong>  which enables natives to then take over those niches as we harvest and pull out these invasives.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:53">0:22:53-0:22:54</a>:</strong>  But let's use them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:54">0:22:54-0:22:55</a>:</strong>  Let's create industry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:55">0:22:55-0:22:57</a>:</strong>  Let's create economy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:22:57">0:22:57-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  Let's create medicine and fiber that we can localize these resources by heavily harvesting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:07</a>:</strong>  those invasives.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:07">0:23:07-0:23:13</a>:</strong>  And I think that's a beautiful win-win function stack problem as a solution approach to looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:13">0:23:13-0:23:16</a>:</strong>  at the role that these invasives play.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:16">0:23:16-0:23:21</a>:</strong>  And then we also have to context this within the overall shifting climate, the overall<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:21">0:23:21-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  shifting of weather patterns, which is more or less the trend is warm weather is moving<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:29</a>:</strong>  north.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:29">0:23:29-0:23:35</a>:</strong>  And so as warm weather moves north, some of these species which may or may not be native<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:35">0:23:35-0:23:40</a>:</strong>  may have better adaptable qualities to a new kind of climate regime.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:40">0:23:40-0:23:44</a>:</strong>  And so they may provide erosion control functions or they might be providing forage for bees<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:44">0:23:44-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  and insects at times of the year when other things aren't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:23:49</a>:</strong>  So we really have to weigh and balance all of this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:49">0:23:49-0:23:53</a>:</strong>  And then back to the original point is that there's no one size fits all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:53">0:23:53-0:23:58</a>:</strong>  This is really a ridge to ridge, valley to valley, meadow to meadow approach to look<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:23:58">0:23:58-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  at what's going on in any one place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:07</a>:</strong>  What's the story of that place and what is the beneficial management regimes that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:07">0:24:07-0:24:09</a>:</strong>  necessary in that place?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:09">0:24:09-0:24:11</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I completely agree with that approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:11">0:24:11-0:24:16</a>:</strong>  I really like what you said about finding an economy or use for the invasive species<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:16">0:24:16-0:24:21</a>:</strong>  that we've otherwise treated as something that needs to be eradicated rather than something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:21">0:24:21-0:24:28</a>:</strong>  that has inherent value in it and is most likely serving a use in the succession of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:28">0:24:28-0:24:33</a>:</strong>  whatever plants are going to go after that either in tilling or re-fertilizing the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:33">0:24:33-0:24:37</a>:</strong>  in some cases or, you know, depending on the plant, there's a lot of different functions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:37">0:24:37-0:24:39</a>:</strong>  that they might serve.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:39">0:24:39-0:24:45</a>:</strong>  Now we've mostly been talking about the recovery of fairly wild or less actively cultivated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:45">0:24:45-0:24:46</a>:</strong>  landscapes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:46">0:24:46-0:24:53</a>:</strong>  What about the, let's say the more actively managed ones, human landscapes, lawns in particular<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:53">0:24:53-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  or public spaces?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:25:01</a>:</strong>  Are there ways that we can start to manage those, especially in your area that would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:01">0:25:01-0:25:07</a>:</strong>  have a healthier relationship with these fire cycles we just mentioned?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:07">0:25:07-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  So for our communities, the urban areas, the suburban areas, there's a pretty prescriptive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:21</a>:</strong>  approach to protecting our communities from fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:21">0:25:21-0:25:27</a>:</strong>  First thing that needs to be said is follow the advice of your local fire department.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:27">0:25:27-0:25:31</a>:</strong>  And one of the things, here's a few of the things that they suggest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:31">0:25:31-0:25:33</a>:</strong>  One is 100 foot defensible space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:33">0:25:33-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  So essentially what that means is that 100 feet around your house where you live, make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:39">0:25:39-0:25:42</a>:</strong>  sure that you don't have excessive fuel load.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:42">0:25:42-0:25:48</a>:</strong>  So if you've got a forest, you might want to manage the understory of that forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:25:53</a>:</strong>  If there's dead or dying branches or trees, remove them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:25:53">0:25:53-0:26:00</a>:</strong>  Often we limb up our trees so that they are, you know, maybe 10 feet off the ground before<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:00">0:26:00-0:26:01</a>:</strong>  you hit the first branch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:01">0:26:01-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  Because when a fire comes, you know, often a fire starts on the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:11</a>:</strong>  And if we can keep it from going up into the canopy, that's the best case scenario.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:11">0:26:11-0:26:17</a>:</strong>  Then we have a low intensity healing type fire that kind of burns across the surface<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:17">0:26:17-0:26:21</a>:</strong>  without catching the canopy and burning trees down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:21">0:26:21-0:26:28</a>:</strong>  That being said, coffee park, which got decimated in the Tubbs fire in 2017, one of the patterns<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:28">0:26:28-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  that we saw was when you look at those photos or you go through that community, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:40</a>:</strong>  now being rebuilt, it was pretty apparent that the trees in that community were not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:40">0:26:40-0:26:42</a>:</strong>  setting the houses on fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:42">0:26:42-0:26:47</a>:</strong>  In fact, it was the opposite that most of the trees that got burned down in coffee park<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:47">0:26:47-0:26:50</a>:</strong>  were burned because they were near a house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:50">0:26:50-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  The house caught fire and then burned the tree down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:26:58</a>:</strong>  And most trees that weren't up against houses didn't actually burn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:26:58">0:26:58-0:27:03</a>:</strong>  So that was a really interesting pattern to see that, you know, the trees around your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:03">0:27:03-0:27:08</a>:</strong>  house, trees around your property, they're not necessarily the problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:08">0:27:08-0:27:15</a>:</strong>  And in most cases, it's the houses themselves that are the biggest fuel load tinder boxes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:15">0:27:15-0:27:17</a>:</strong>  ready to go up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:17">0:27:17-0:27:22</a>:</strong>  After the Tubbs fire, we had a neighborhood gathering here in my neighborhood and where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:22">0:27:22-0:27:26</a>:</strong>  we had about 50 families and folk that live around here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:26">0:27:26-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  And we're all living on one to two acre properties.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:35</a>:</strong>  And we had a fire, a battalion chief come out and meet with us for a couple hours.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:35">0:27:35-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  That was really eye opening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:43</a>:</strong>  And what he said that we need to do is you really need to go around your house and identify<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:43">0:27:43-0:27:47</a>:</strong>  any places where embers can ignite around your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:47">0:27:47-0:27:49</a>:</strong>  It might be around a deck.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:49">0:27:49-0:27:53</a>:</strong>  It might be a little shed that has, you know, gas cans in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:53">0:27:53-0:27:55</a>:</strong>  It might be the vents in your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:27:55">0:27:55-0:28:00</a>:</strong>  It might be dry leaves, you know, right around the base of your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:00">0:28:00-0:28:06</a>:</strong>  And really look for, you know, when the embers blow in because the fire is spread first and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:06">0:28:06-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  foremost through the movement of embers, hot embers, and they usually blow ahead of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:20</a>:</strong>  So you've got these, you know, burning pieces of leaf and coal and wood and house and whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:20">0:28:20-0:28:25</a>:</strong>  might be blowing across and starting all these little spot fires and those turn into big<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:25">0:28:25-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  fires.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  So how can we protect our houses from igniting?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:31">0:28:31-0:28:36</a>:</strong>  Certainly if you have trees that are, that have branches that are like touching the roof<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:36">0:28:36-0:28:38</a>:</strong>  of your house, those you want to remove.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:38">0:28:38-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  And that's good actually rodent control anyway, because rats like to use those as their pathways<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:45</a>:</strong>  to get into addicts and things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:45">0:28:45-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  So you want to manage the vegetation around your house in such a way that you're not increasing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:52</a>:</strong>  field load, but your vegetation is the least of your worries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:52">0:28:52-0:28:57</a>:</strong>  Most people have junk, you know, I mean stuff like around the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:28:58</a>:</strong>  It's a wood pile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:28:58">0:28:58-0:29:02</a>:</strong>  It's a, you know, timber for the deck that wasn't finished.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:02">0:29:02-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  It's gas cans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:09</a>:</strong>  It's camping gear, you know, and you don't want to have a lot of stuff around the base<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:09">0:29:09-0:29:10</a>:</strong>  of your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:10">0:29:10-0:29:16</a>:</strong>  You can also store that in a storage shed away or make sure that you have things in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:16">0:29:16-0:29:18</a>:</strong>  your garage well sealed up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:18">0:29:18-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  So there's a lot of potential places for embers to ignite around your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:26</a>:</strong>  And that's one of the most important things to watch out for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:26">0:29:26-0:29:31</a>:</strong>  One thing that I've noticed that happens is people get so worried about this, so worried<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:31">0:29:31-0:29:37</a>:</strong>  about their landscaping and having plants around the house, thinking that this is the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:37">0:29:37-0:29:42</a>:</strong>  main fuel load you have to worry about, that folks end up doing this moonscape type thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:42">0:29:42-0:29:47</a>:</strong>  where they remove all the vegetation and they just pour concrete or they just have gravel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:47">0:29:47-0:29:48</a>:</strong>  or something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:48">0:29:48-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  And they think that that's going to protect them in a fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:29:56</a>:</strong>  Well, I confirmed it with our battalion chief that that's not actually necessarily going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:56">0:29:56-0:29:57</a>:</strong>  to protect you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:29:57">0:29:57-0:30:01</a>:</strong>  And one of the things that we found in the big fires around here is that some houses<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:01">0:30:01-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  were literally saved by the green vegetation around them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  So a well thought out fire oriented landscape could actually protect your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  And one of the things we noticed was a lot of really green hedgerows that were well managed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:26</a>:</strong>  became heat buffers from as the fire blew through, they might catch embers that would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:26">0:30:26-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  have gone into the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:32</a>:</strong>  And instead they were caught by a hedgerow that was maybe 23 feet away from the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:32">0:30:32-0:30:39</a>:</strong>  And that the heat wave that precedes the flames also these hedgerows protected the houses<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:39">0:30:39-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  from those heat waves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:30:41</a>:</strong>  Because sometimes it's not even an ember.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:41">0:30:41-0:30:47</a>:</strong>  Sometimes it's just the heat wave that's coming off of the fire is so hot and so intense that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:47">0:30:47-0:30:52</a>:</strong>  it will ignite your house just by the intensity of the heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:52">0:30:52-0:30:56</a>:</strong>  And so again, you know, understand your context.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:56">0:30:56-0:30:57</a>:</strong>  Are you living on a ridge?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:57">0:30:57-0:30:59</a>:</strong>  Are you living down in a valley?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:30:59">0:30:59-0:31:04</a>:</strong>  This is going to change how you approach your fire management around your house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:04">0:31:04-0:31:06</a>:</strong>  Fire generally moves uphill.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:06">0:31:06-0:31:10</a>:</strong>  So if you live up on a ridge on the side of a ridge, then you want to identify what we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:10">0:31:10-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  call chimneys.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:11">0:31:11-0:31:14</a>:</strong>  And those chimneys are your main fire corridor, your main fire zone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:14">0:31:14-0:31:20</a>:</strong>  If a fire hit, it's going to run, it's going to ride up that chimney and right into your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:20">0:31:20-0:31:21</a>:</strong>  house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:21">0:31:21-0:31:27</a>:</strong>  So when you have that level of assessment, you can understand the pattern that fire might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:27">0:31:27-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  follow in your neighborhood, in your region.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:36</a>:</strong>  Then you can start managing and designing for this specifically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:36">0:31:36-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  And some of the things we're doing is we're thinking about shaded fuel breaks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:46</a>:</strong>  So you've got places like Coffee Park, which was a very, you know, built up suburb, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:31:51</a>:</strong>  know, thousands of homes really packed in your typical suburb.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:51">0:31:51-0:31:56</a>:</strong>  That's different than a somewhat rural neighborhood like where I live, where everyone has an acre.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:31:56">0:31:56-0:32:00</a>:</strong>  But there's still a lot of us living on this land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:00">0:32:00-0:32:03</a>:</strong>  Those are two different approaches that you'll have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:03">0:32:03-0:32:13</a>:</strong>  And in my case, in my neighborhood, we have the ability to think about stopping fire at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:13">0:32:13-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  the edge of our property, to think about different ways of, you know, if it's putting in ponds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:20">0:32:20-0:32:24</a>:</strong>  and creating some cooling and fire breaks, that's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:24">0:32:24-0:32:26</a>:</strong>  We talk a lot about shaded fuel breaks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:26">0:32:26-0:32:33</a>:</strong>  If you're in a neighborhood that is in a forested area, then how can you look at shaded fuel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:33">0:32:33-0:32:37</a>:</strong>  breaks and ways that you can stop fire?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:37">0:32:37-0:32:43</a>:</strong>  And the other piece that a lot of fire professionals talk a lot about, and it's really important,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:43">0:32:43-0:32:46</a>:</strong>  is they need access.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:46">0:32:46-0:32:55</a>:</strong>  And if you don't provide access when a fire hits and the firefighters don't feel safe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:32:55">0:32:55-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  to drive up to your house, they're not going to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:02</a>:</strong>  If it's not safe, they're not going to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:02">0:33:02-0:33:05</a>:</strong>  They're going to let that place burn because they've got other people they want to save<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:05">0:33:05-0:33:08</a>:</strong>  and they don't want to put themselves at risk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:08">0:33:08-0:33:16</a>:</strong>  So access, which is really about having open areas where a fire truck can turn around,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:16">0:33:16-0:33:23</a>:</strong>  if that's the case, or having a neighborhood plan as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:23">0:33:23-0:33:26</a>:</strong>  One of the things we've been seeing a lot since the Tufts fires in these more rural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:26">0:33:26-0:33:33</a>:</strong>  communities, folks are kind of erasing this concept of private property boundaries where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:33">0:33:33-0:33:36</a>:</strong>  everyone's managing their own properties differently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:36">0:33:36-0:33:42</a>:</strong>  And we're seeing now whole neighborhoods of people coming together and collectively talking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:42">0:33:42-0:33:47</a>:</strong>  about how they're going to manage the fuel load on their properties, where they're going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:47">0:33:47-0:33:50</a>:</strong>  to put firebreaks, where they're going to put escape routes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:50">0:33:50-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  I've had neighbors say, hey, if you need to knock down my fence and get through my property<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:55">0:33:55-0:33:58</a>:</strong>  to escape in a fire, go ahead and do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:33:58">0:33:58-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  Things like that, where we can come together and have a plan collectively are very, very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  powerful because we're not isolated in this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:11</a>:</strong>  And our neighbors are really going to affect us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:11">0:34:11-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  Right now, everybody should be mowing their tall grasses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:20</a>:</strong>  And that's, you know, I drive by my local fire department and they've got their little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:20">0:34:20-0:34:24</a>:</strong>  informational signs out there and they say, high weed mowing, be a good neighbor, mow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:27</a>:</strong>  down your high weeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:27">0:34:27-0:34:28</a>:</strong>  That is the case.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:28">0:34:28-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  We should all be doing that, not only to protect ourselves, but to protect each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  So we have to come at this not as individuals, but as communities, as neighborhoods, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:39</a>:</strong>  create plans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:39">0:34:39-0:34:45</a>:</strong>  In my neighborhood, we have a map of the neighborhood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:45">0:34:45-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  On that map is not just people's information, but who has water tanks, who has ponds, how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:34:55</a>:</strong>  much water is stored, where their fire exits and escapes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:34:55">0:34:55-0:35:00</a>:</strong>  And so this is the kind of resilience that we need to be setting up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:00">0:35:00-0:35:06</a>:</strong>  It's not just physical design, it's social design as well to give us those, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:06">0:35:06-0:35:10</a>:</strong>  the best opportunity to stay safe in a fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:10">0:35:10-0:35:16</a>:</strong>  That's such good advice and I think transcends just fire preparedness and perhaps communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:16">0:35:16-0:35:22</a>:</strong>  that are at risk of flood damage or other types of storms could benefit from collaborating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:22">0:35:22-0:35:27</a>:</strong>  and coming up with community-wide plans and figuring out how each property sort of plays<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:27">0:35:27-0:35:34</a>:</strong>  a role in a larger preparedness for the things that most threaten those communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:34">0:35:34-0:35:36</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:36">0:35:36-0:35:42</a>:</strong>  And I think one of the big aha moments that we all got during these fires, because none<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:42">0:35:42-0:35:46</a>:</strong>  of us ever thought that Santa Rosa, that's the town where I grew up, got hit hard in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:46">0:35:46-0:35:48</a>:</strong>  the Tubbs fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:48">0:35:48-0:35:50</a>:</strong>  You know, we didn't think Santa Rosa could catch on fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:50">0:35:50-0:35:54</a>:</strong>  I mean, there's 200,000 people living there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:54">0:35:54-0:35:59</a>:</strong>  It's a city and you think about like a firestorm is going to blow through there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:35:59">0:35:59-0:36:04</a>:</strong>  Okay, maybe a building will catch fire here or there, but a firestorm that can't be stopped,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:04">0:36:04-0:36:08</a>:</strong>  it's literally taking out neighborhood after neighborhood after neighborhood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:08">0:36:08-0:36:11</a>:</strong>  That felt like something that would never happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:11">0:36:11-0:36:17</a>:</strong>  One, because we've totally forgot our recent history, just 50 years ago history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:17">0:36:17-0:36:23</a>:</strong>  Two, because we haven't had the wisdom to talk to our native people, the native people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:23">0:36:23-0:36:29</a>:</strong>  that have been in relationship with these lands for so long.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:29">0:36:29-0:36:36</a>:</strong>  And so what that brought up is, and to your point about natural disaster, about flood,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:36">0:36:36-0:36:45</a>:</strong>  drought, fire, hurricane, earthquake, it's a sobering notion, but none of this is an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:45">0:36:45-0:36:47</a>:</strong>  if it happens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:47">0:36:47-0:36:52</a>:</strong>  And that's what we need to realize is it's a when, when is it going to happen?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:52">0:36:52-0:36:57</a>:</strong>  Because these are natural phenomenons that humans don't have a lot of control in stopping.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:36:57">0:36:57-0:37:06</a>:</strong>  So even if the flood doesn't hit your community for 30, 40 years, if you're in a flood, it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:06">0:37:06-0:37:07</a>:</strong>  will hit at some point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:07">0:37:07-0:37:12</a>:</strong>  Even if your community is never burned, but there's a history of fire, at some point the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:12">0:37:12-0:37:13</a>:</strong>  fire is going to roll through there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:13">0:37:13-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  It's not an if, it's a when.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:22</a>:</strong>  And as soon as we acknowledge that, then we can start being smart about how we manage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:22">0:37:22-0:37:25</a>:</strong>  and plan together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:25">0:37:25-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:26">0:37:26-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  Now, you mentioned something earlier too, as warmer weather starts to move up north,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:36</a>:</strong>  it's bringing species that maybe will out-compete or will adapt sooner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:36">0:37:36-0:37:41</a>:</strong>  But there's a lot of other things to consider, especially in your line of work as an ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:41">0:37:41-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  designer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:47</a>:</strong>  Could you maybe talk a little about designing for lower consumption and perhaps maintenance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:47">0:37:47-0:37:54</a>:</strong>  as the area that we have come individually to understand being a part of whatever classification<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:37:54">0:37:54-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  you may have, whether it's the USDA hardiness zones or just the climate that you have come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  to rely on as a constant begins to change in whichever way based on your locale is going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:09</a>:</strong>  to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:09">0:38:09-0:38:17</a>:</strong>  How do you predict that and design for the changes that are likely to happen?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:17">0:38:17-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  First off, as a species down to a person, we need to become people of the land again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:26">0:38:26-0:38:36</a>:</strong>  And what I mean by that is we have to go about our days each day, noticing what's happening<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:36">0:38:36-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  in the natural environment around us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:41</a>:</strong>  Even if you're in an urban community, what kinds of weeds are growing, what kinds of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:41">0:38:41-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  plants are growing, what kinds of birds are there, what's thriving, what's not thriving.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:50</a>:</strong>  Because again, it's all about place, not every place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:50">0:38:50-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  There's so many microclimates and soil changes and topographical changes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:38:58</a>:</strong>  Everything has to be context to place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:38:58">0:38:58-0:39:06</a>:</strong>  And I start with that because I can see the patterns every single day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:06">0:39:06-0:39:13</a>:</strong>  I can see what's getting hit by disease, what's thriving, when there's a disturbance, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:13">0:39:13-0:39:14</a>:</strong>  comes in first.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:14">0:39:14-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  It's all is just about awareness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:16">0:39:16-0:39:21</a>:</strong>  And so first and foremost, if we all learn to become people of the land again, then we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:21">0:39:21-0:39:26</a>:</strong>  constantly in a communication and a dialogue with the ecology every day, whether we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:26">0:39:26-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  going to work or school or hanging out or whatever it might be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:36</a>:</strong>  We're noticing the ecological patterns and the plant patterns and insect patterns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:36">0:39:36-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  And that is the information that's going to, that's the data point that you need to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:46</a>:</strong>  able to understand the changes that are taking place and how we design for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:46">0:39:46-0:39:48</a>:</strong>  So that's first and foremost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:48">0:39:48-0:39:54</a>:</strong>  Second off, it has a lot to do with our cultural aesthetic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:39:54">0:39:54-0:40:00</a>:</strong>  And currently Western culture's aesthetic for landscape is a very English rose garden<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:00">0:40:00-0:40:11</a>:</strong>  aesthetic, very, very perfect lawns and perfectly managed shrubs and trees and all of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:11">0:40:11-0:40:16</a>:</strong>  And that aesthetic is very, I want to say, you know, it's not very natural.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:16">0:40:16-0:40:22</a>:</strong>  It's not how the natural ecosystem, and when you talk about low impact and when we think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:22">0:40:22-0:40:26</a>:</strong>  about, well, how can we reduce our consumption?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:26">0:40:26-0:40:35</a>:</strong>  A lot of that is in many ways, and this is counterintuitive again, but I've been, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:35">0:40:35-0:40:39</a>:</strong>  know, it's over 20 years now I've been doing permaculture and reading landscapes and working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:39">0:40:39-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  with the land every single day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:50</a>:</strong>  And in the last few years, what I've been really blown away by is how, what actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:50">0:40:50-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  I need to do more is to get out of the way of natural systems evolution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  That often the decision to not do something, to not intervene is as powerful or more powerful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:11</a>:</strong>  than the decision to go in there and intervene in a system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:11">0:41:11-0:41:18</a>:</strong>  Because in some ways there's a level of trust of the natural ecology to kind of have the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:18">0:41:18-0:41:26</a>:</strong>  deeper wisdom that we don't have to know how to adapt and change to the bigger changes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:26">0:41:26-0:41:27</a>:</strong>  that are happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:27">0:41:27-0:41:32</a>:</strong>  And so there's a bit of trust in the more that I, and I'll give you an example, okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:32">0:41:32-0:41:39</a>:</strong>  This spring, as the news about the insect apocalypse started ramping up and the realization<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:39">0:41:39-0:41:48</a>:</strong>  that we might lose the world of insects in the next 50 years, that's an insane, horrible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:48">0:41:48-0:41:50</a>:</strong>  thing to consider.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:50">0:41:50-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  And I realized that on my little one acre homestead that I hadn't planted enough early<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:04</a>:</strong>  spring forage, like C. anothis and silk tassel and manzanita, that would provide forage for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:04">0:42:04-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  bees earlier on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:10</a>:</strong>  So I was sort of, I was like, oh gosh, I haven't planted enough of these.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:10">0:42:10-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  But then the wild radish, which is a bane of many gardeners around here, because it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:20</a>:</strong>  a, you know, it's not a native and it grows really proficiently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:20">0:42:20-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  The wild radish sort of like took over the garden in early spring in February and started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  blooming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:32</a>:</strong>  And I noticed that all the bees and butterflies were all over these radishes, like all in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:32">0:42:32-0:42:35</a>:</strong>  the second half of winter and into early spring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:35">0:42:35-0:42:39</a>:</strong>  And that was that realization of, you know, normally I would come out here and I would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:39">0:42:39-0:42:42</a>:</strong>  cut back a lot of this and start to prep for spring garden.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:42">0:42:42-0:42:49</a>:</strong>  But this year instead, instead of taking that action to go intervene, I allowed that wild<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:49">0:42:49-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  radish to more or less take over the garden and held back prepping my spring vegetables<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:43:04</a>:</strong>  by probably about a month to allow this forage for wildlife to have its place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:04">0:43:04-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  And that wild radish bloomed for months.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:08</a>:</strong>  And it was amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:08">0:43:08-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  All the species, every day I go out there and look at everyone who's visiting these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:13</a>:</strong>  flowers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:13">0:43:13-0:43:14</a>:</strong>  It was absolutely amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:14">0:43:14-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  And that's where I sort of just, you know, had that, ah, okay, you know, nature has a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:25</a>:</strong>  wisdom that I need to trust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:25">0:43:25-0:43:31</a>:</strong>  And the more that I can observe and listen, the more I can be in relationship and know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:31">0:43:31-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  when to take action, when to intervene.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:38</a>:</strong>  Like for instance, an overcrowded forest that's full of fuel load.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:38">0:43:38-0:43:43</a>:</strong>  I would not hesitate to intervene in a situation like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:43">0:43:43-0:43:49</a>:</strong>  But in a situation like my garden, when we're trying to protect the future of insects and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:49">0:43:49-0:43:52</a>:</strong>  I'm about to take out the main forage plant, okay, let me not do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:52">0:43:52-0:43:59</a>:</strong>  So a lot of it is about connecting and understanding and reading the patterns and learning how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:43:59">0:43:59-0:44:00</a>:</strong>  to intervene and not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:00">0:44:00-0:44:06</a>:</strong>  And the other side is to plant diversity, plant and diversity, plant a lot of different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:06">0:44:06-0:44:13</a>:</strong>  species and experiment in, you know, around our houses, around our homes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:13">0:44:13-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  That's the place to experiment, not in the wild, experiment around your homes, plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:23</a>:</strong>  a lot of diverse and I expect die off, you know, in every garden and landscape, I expect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:23">0:44:23-0:44:25</a>:</strong>  certain things to die off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:25">0:44:25-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  And that tells me something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:31</a>:</strong>  Some plants that I, you know, didn't care that much about all of a sudden become the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:31">0:44:31-0:44:38</a>:</strong>  thriving anchor of the landscape and the provider.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:38">0:44:38-0:44:40</a>:</strong>  And so I have a new love for that plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:40">0:44:40-0:44:43</a>:</strong>  So a lot of it is about that approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:43">0:44:43-0:44:46</a>:</strong>  And I know these aren't like tangible, you know, here's a checklist of things you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:46">0:44:46-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:54</a>:</strong>  But I think it's this deeper understanding that leads us to make the right decisions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:54">0:44:54-0:44:58</a>:</strong>  I think that's a great observation and definitely one of the commonalities that I've been sussing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:44:58">0:44:58-0:45:02</a>:</strong>  out through these interviews, especially with people who have more experience and have been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:02">0:45:02-0:45:09</a>:</strong>  doing this for a longer period of time, they tend to shy away from prescribed techniques<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:09">0:45:09-0:45:13</a>:</strong>  or things that have actually worked for them and tend to focus much more on pattern recognition<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:13">0:45:13-0:45:15</a>:</strong>  and observation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:15">0:45:15-0:45:22</a>:</strong>  And it's really cool to see that kind of emerge from patterns themselves in the information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:24</a>:</strong>  that I'm getting when I ask certain questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:24">0:45:24-0:45:30</a>:</strong>  And it's causing me to think a lot more about how interaction within these systems that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:30">0:45:30-0:45:35</a>:</strong>  we either create or that we simply go out and observe ideally in their most untouched<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:35">0:45:35-0:45:42</a>:</strong>  form can give us the information to create more elegant and compassionate designs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:42">0:45:42-0:45:48</a>:</strong>  But also where does technology come in, especially as you're operating this on a business level,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:45:54</a>:</strong>  to kind of gather information that either we couldn't observe on our own or would be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:54">0:45:54-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  difficult to kind of compile or create as a data set.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:46:03</a>:</strong>  I'm talking, of course, like with computers and creating spreadsheets to crunch information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:03">0:46:03-0:46:09</a>:</strong>  Perhaps if you have experience using drones or mapping technology like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:09">0:46:09-0:46:15</a>:</strong>  Where do those fit in with the on the ground observation of nature to help make more informed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:15">0:46:15-0:46:18</a>:</strong>  decisions?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:18">0:46:18-0:46:27</a>:</strong>  They are important tools that we use daily to assess landscapes and provide those prescription<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:27">0:46:27-0:46:28</a>:</strong>  services for our clients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:28">0:46:28-0:46:32</a>:</strong>  So the more that we can under, you know, there's a lot of different ways to understand the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:32">0:46:32-0:46:37</a>:</strong>  land and not everyone's going to have, you know, to be able to not everyone's going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:37">0:46:37-0:46:43</a>:</strong>  be able to walk onto a site and and take in as much information as someone who's been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:43">0:46:43-0:46:45</a>:</strong>  doing that for 20 years can do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:45">0:46:45-0:46:49</a>:</strong>  And sometimes the landscapes are really large and you're not going to be able to get much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:49">0:46:49-0:46:52</a>:</strong>  in an even a single day walk around.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:52">0:46:52-0:46:56</a>:</strong>  So it's a it's kind of an all the above, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:46:56">0:46:56-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  You've got your on the ground observation, which is one level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:07</a>:</strong>  You've got topography and topographical maps, which are an essential tool for design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:07">0:47:07-0:47:14</a>:</strong>  And all of our projects that are beyond like suburban scale, we produce topographical maps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:14">0:47:14-0:47:17</a>:</strong>  Usually they're overlaid on satellite imagery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:17">0:47:17-0:47:21</a>:</strong>  And then what's beautiful about that is then you can let me at least like with Google Earth,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:29</a>:</strong>  you can go back in time, maybe about 20 years in some cases and see satellite images of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:29">0:47:29-0:47:31</a>:</strong>  the last 20 years of that site.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:31">0:47:31-0:47:36</a>:</strong>  But the more that we can understand the history of a site and that and when we say story of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:36">0:47:36-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  place, that's really what that is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:47:43</a>:</strong>  That's that's really what we're talking about is, okay, what what are the patterns here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:43">0:47:43-0:47:46</a>:</strong>  Did fire roll through here at one point or what kind of natural disasters?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:46">0:47:46-0:47:51</a>:</strong>  What were the dominant species that's, you know, in the past?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:51">0:47:51-0:47:55</a>:</strong>  What kinds of social activities in the industry?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:55">0:47:55-0:47:57</a>:</strong>  You know, was this logged?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:57">0:47:57-0:47:58</a>:</strong>  Are these logging roads?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:47:58">0:47:58-0:48:04</a>:</strong>  Is it a silage operation where they grew out here for 30, 40 years and mined all the nutrients<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:04">0:48:04-0:48:06</a>:</strong>  out of the soil?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:06">0:48:06-0:48:11</a>:</strong>  These are all really important aspects of that data collection and that initial site<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:11">0:48:11-0:48:16</a>:</strong>  assessment to understand soil, water, vegetation, climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:16">0:48:16-0:48:20</a>:</strong>  And the more that we understand soil, water, vegetation, climate, now we can start coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:20">0:48:20-0:48:24</a>:</strong>  up with a prescriptive design plan to move forward that really takes into account the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:24">0:48:24-0:48:27</a>:</strong>  constraints and resources of that site.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:27">0:48:27-0:48:34</a>:</strong>  So drones have become a powerful tool for mostly from a presentation point of view,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:34">0:48:34-0:48:39</a>:</strong>  I would say, because we also we want to provide professional services for folks and to provide<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:39">0:48:39-0:48:45</a>:</strong>  professional services means that the materials that we give them, whether it's maps or it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:45">0:48:45-0:48:51</a>:</strong>  written out notes and recommendations or it's concept plans, we want these plans and these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:48:51">0:48:51-0:49:01</a>:</strong>  maps to be professionally done, accurate, to scale most of the time, and really born<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:01">0:49:01-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  out of an understanding of the patterns in the history, the natural history of the site.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:05">0:49:05-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  So all of that, as the technology has gotten better and better, like the drones have gotten<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:19</a>:</strong>  better and smaller and cheaper, we've been using that technology a lot more and it speeds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:19">0:49:19-0:49:27</a>:</strong>  up the ability to present concepts to clients, to educate them and move management forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:27">0:49:27-0:49:38</a>:</strong>  Now one of the challenges that we face in this work is how we educate clients around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:38">0:49:38-0:49:40</a>:</strong>  this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:40">0:49:40-0:49:47</a>:</strong>  And when folks who are doing ecological landscape design, you have a choice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:47">0:49:47-0:49:52</a>:</strong>  And I'm not going to say one way is better than another, but you have a choice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:49:52">0:49:52-0:50:00</a>:</strong>  You can either provide landscape services to clients based on what the client wants,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:00">0:50:00-0:50:06</a>:</strong>  first and foremost, regardless of ecology, and you can build a nice business that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:06">0:50:06-0:50:14</a>:</strong>  Or as you deepen your understanding of a place, you can really push a client, educate a client<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:14">0:50:14-0:50:19</a>:</strong>  to make the right decisions based on the ecological resources and constraints.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:19">0:50:19-0:50:23</a>:</strong>  Now that's not always easy in most projects you find that middle ground, but the truth<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:23">0:50:23-0:50:32</a>:</strong>  is, the more professional your presentation, the more accurate your information, you'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:32">0:50:32-0:50:37</a>:</strong>  have a much easier time of bringing a client on board to understand like, oh God, yeah,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:37">0:50:37-0:50:41</a>:</strong>  I probably should manage that bit of forest at the edge of my property because it's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:41">0:50:41-0:50:46</a>:</strong>  fuel load issue, or I should focus on water catchment, even though I really just want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:46">0:50:46-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  like a patio with some herbs and a place to hang out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:57</a>:</strong>  Maybe I should put a rain garden into that herb garden and maybe my patio should be permeable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:50:57">0:50:57-0:51:01</a>:</strong>  because of all these aspects related to water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:05</a>:</strong>  So as ecological landscapers, we're an edge species right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:05">0:51:05-0:51:11</a>:</strong>  And one of the things that we're doing is we're bringing the traditional process of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:11">0:51:11-0:51:22</a>:</strong>  landscape design and construction together with the ecological way of managing the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:22">0:51:22-0:51:29</a>:</strong>  And I've spoken about this at length over the years, that the more professional we are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:29">0:51:29-0:51:33</a>:</strong>  when we do that, the more effective we are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:33">0:51:33-0:51:38</a>:</strong>  And if we just talk about the idealism, if we're just ideal and we talk about all these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:38">0:51:38-0:51:41</a>:</strong>  things that you tell a client, you should do this, you should do that because it's good<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:41">0:51:41-0:51:44</a>:</strong>  for the water, you should do this because it's good for the soil, but we don't back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:44">0:51:44-0:51:49</a>:</strong>  that up with data, we don't present it in a professional way, they're not going to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:49">0:51:49-0:51:50</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:50">0:51:50-0:51:54</a>:</strong>  And they may not trust it and then they might make different decisions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:51:54">0:51:54-0:52:03</a>:</strong>  So we're sort of at the forefront of shifting the cultural narrative of landscape from an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:03">0:52:03-0:52:18</a>:</strong>  extractive, impose upon way to a regenerative, compose with nature point of view.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:18">0:52:18-0:52:25</a>:</strong>  And professionalism is our main tool, our main package to move the mainstream in this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:25">0:52:25-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:31</a>:</strong>  Along those lines, what of the technology that you use commonly would you recommend<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:31">0:52:31-0:52:36</a>:</strong>  that someone starting out in this business invest in, in order to help them get to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:36">0:52:36-0:52:41</a>:</strong>  next level and present themselves as professionally as possible?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:41">0:52:41-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  First off, you have to understand yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:49</a>:</strong>  Google Earth, everyone should be using Google Earth in this work because it's so accessible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:49">0:52:49-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  And even if all you do is you have a satellite image that you annotate on, you know, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:52:59</a>:</strong>  draw some lines on it, or you print it out and draw on it that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:52:59">0:52:59-0:53:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's the most simple baseline, cheapest thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:03">0:53:03-0:53:04</a>:</strong>  Everybody can use that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:04">0:53:04-0:53:09</a>:</strong>  And even at our level, where I have a seven figure landscape company and 20 employees,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:09">0:53:09-0:53:12</a>:</strong>  we're still use Google Earth in our process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:12">0:53:12-0:53:15</a>:</strong>  So it's so it works from beginner all the way to advanced level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:15">0:53:15-0:53:19</a>:</strong>  So absolutely, Google Earth is is a key tool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:19">0:53:19-0:53:26</a>:</strong>  And then when we think about design, you there's so many options there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:26">0:53:26-0:53:36</a>:</strong>  And we use in our office, we use Auto AutoCAD, which is the industry standard for digital<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:36">0:53:36-0:53:37</a>:</strong>  design plans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:37">0:53:37-0:53:41</a>:</strong>  And one of the reasons why we use AutoCAD is because the architects are using AutoCAD,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:41">0:53:41-0:53:43</a>:</strong>  the engineers are using AutoCAD.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:43">0:53:43-0:53:50</a>:</strong>  And so it is very useful in using a format that is accepted across various trades and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:50">0:53:50-0:53:53</a>:</strong>  various industries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:53:53">0:53:53-0:54:00</a>:</strong>  Because you can now talk with other other professionals, you can integrate mapping concepts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:00">0:54:00-0:54:04</a>:</strong>  and and build and layer upon each other with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:04">0:54:04-0:54:08</a>:</strong>  So we use AutoCAD, but AutoCAD is a is an advanced tool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:08">0:54:08-0:54:11</a>:</strong>  It's takes a long time to learn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:11">0:54:11-0:54:16</a>:</strong>  And I wouldn't suggest anyone starting out that you should jump into that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:16">0:54:16-0:54:19</a>:</strong>  It's something to work towards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:19">0:54:19-0:54:21</a>:</strong>  And so there's a lot of different things out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:21">0:54:21-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  There's Dynascape, there's Inkscape, there's SketchUp.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:26</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of different tools.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:26">0:54:26-0:54:31</a>:</strong>  And if folks want to go digital, which is where you're going to be able to create a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:31">0:54:31-0:54:35</a>:</strong>  lot of these professional designs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:35">0:54:35-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  Some of those might be I think Inkscape is free.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:40</a>:</strong>  So that might be a good place for people to start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:40">0:54:40-0:54:42</a>:</strong>  Vectorworks is another one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:42">0:54:42-0:54:44</a>:</strong>  So you have to decide if that's the path you want to take.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:44">0:54:44-0:54:54</a>:</strong>  Now for myself, I am not literate when it comes to digital design software.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:54">0:54:54-0:54:55</a>:</strong>  I'm not literate at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:55">0:54:55-0:54:58</a>:</strong>  I don't I don't use any of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:54:58">0:54:58-0:55:00</a>:</strong>  It's not my it's not my passion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:00">0:55:00-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  It's not my forte.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:06</a>:</strong>  And but what I'm good at doing is I'm good at organizing other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:06">0:55:06-0:55:10</a>:</strong>  And so so I always tell my students, you have to know who you are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:10">0:55:10-0:55:17</a>:</strong>  If you are so if you're if you're a hands in the ground person, and you're not it and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:17">0:55:17-0:55:21</a>:</strong>  learning a computer technology just isn't in the cards for you, that is totally fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:21">0:55:21-0:55:24</a>:</strong>  It doesn't mean that you can't get to that professional level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:24">0:55:24-0:55:28</a>:</strong>  It just means that you need to partner up with somebody who has that passion and that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:28">0:55:28-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:29">0:55:29-0:55:30</a>:</strong>  And that's what I've done over the years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:30">0:55:30-0:55:35</a>:</strong>  And now my design, my design department, there's currently three designers soon to be four<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:35">0:55:35-0:55:42</a>:</strong>  designers in my design department that are producing these professional quality maps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:42">0:55:42-0:55:47</a>:</strong>  Now if you have drafting skills like hand drawn skills, that's totally fine as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:47">0:55:47-0:55:49</a>:</strong>  You don't have to do things digitally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:49">0:55:49-0:55:55</a>:</strong>  If you have if you can do artistic rendering by hand, in some sometimes that's even better,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:55">0:55:55-0:55:57</a>:</strong>  depending on the client.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:55:57">0:55:57-0:56:05</a>:</strong>  A well drawn out, hand drawn map can be beautiful and artistic, and a great way to communicate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:05">0:56:05-0:56:10</a>:</strong>  So you have to know yourself your strengths and and and ask yourself what you're willing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:10">0:56:10-0:56:13</a>:</strong>  to learn and where you want to go with this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:13">0:56:13-0:56:16</a>:</strong>  Ask yourself if you can work with others, if that's a model that works for you, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:16">0:56:16-0:56:21</a>:</strong>  thing is, when we talk about ecological landscaping, there are just so many different ways to go<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:21">0:56:21-0:56:25</a>:</strong>  about this, which I think is so wonderful, because I think there's a fit for everybody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:25">0:56:25-0:56:30</a>:</strong>  You could be the solo designer that has all the design chops and can produce these maps<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:30">0:56:30-0:56:34</a>:</strong>  and you could have a whole business just you doing consultation and design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:34">0:56:34-0:56:35</a>:</strong>  And that's it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:35">0:56:35-0:56:39</a>:</strong>  You could build a nice business that way, regenerating the planet and inspiring people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:39">0:56:39-0:56:41</a>:</strong>  to connect with nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:41">0:56:41-0:56:47</a>:</strong>  Or like me, you can be someone who would prefer to be digging in the in the earth, or prefer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:47">0:56:47-0:56:54</a>:</strong>  to be walking on the soil and and build a team around you to do all the things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:54">0:56:54-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  you don't like to do, but are necessary.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:57:04</a>:</strong>  And some folks, you know, going into the construction side of this is a whole different ballgame<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:04">0:57:04-0:57:08</a>:</strong>  than just doing being a consultant or in a designer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:08">0:57:08-0:57:09</a>:</strong>  And it's not for everybody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:09">0:57:09-0:57:16</a>:</strong>  And it's much more stressful to have the installation arm of doing this work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:16">0:57:16-0:57:23</a>:</strong>  But it's, it's quite rewarding, because you're literally building regenerative system, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:23">0:57:23-0:57:27</a>:</strong>  you're not just conceptualizing it, you're actually in there building soil, planting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:27">0:57:27-0:57:32</a>:</strong>  trees, catching water, you get to see the results of your design of your work, you get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:32">0:57:32-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  to ensure that it's done right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:39</a>:</strong>  You get to ensure that the impact is the is the minimum, the least negative impact on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:39">0:57:39-0:57:41</a>:</strong>  the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:41">0:57:41-0:57:46</a>:</strong>  And from a business point of view, instill construction installation generally has a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:46">0:57:46-0:57:49</a>:</strong>  higher profit margin as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:49">0:57:49-0:57:54</a>:</strong>  So it could be more of a financial approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:54">0:57:54-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  But there's a lot of liability, a lot of stress, you're managing staff, you're managing a team<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:00</a>:</strong>  of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:00">0:58:00-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  And so you have to know what your skill level is, and then and then build your business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  around where your skill level and your passions are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:13</a>:</strong>  That is another great set of advice there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:13">0:58:13-0:58:18</a>:</strong>  And quite frankly, I wish I had heard that when I was first starting out in all of these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:18">0:58:18-0:58:22</a>:</strong>  different types of work, because I've struggled with basically every single one of those steps<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:22">0:58:22-0:58:27</a>:</strong>  that you laid out as the designer figuring out if I wanted to do my designs hand drawn,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:27">0:58:27-0:58:31</a>:</strong>  which was kind of always my skill set from before, but also realizing that there's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:31">0:58:31-0:58:36</a>:</strong>  lot of powerful technology that can speed that along or present things even in a better<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:36">0:58:36-0:58:37</a>:</strong>  way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:37">0:58:37-0:58:41</a>:</strong>  And then figuring out where I stand in the implementation, because in a lot of places<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:41">0:58:41-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  that I've worked in developing countries, there hasn't been someone else there that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:58:52</a>:</strong>  I could either connect with very well, or that I could give these types of instructions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:52">0:58:52-0:58:58</a>:</strong>  over that either had access to the experience or the equipment to implement the designs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:58">0:58:58-0:58:59</a>:</strong>  that I'd put out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:58:59">0:58:59-0:59:06</a>:</strong>  And by constantly being stretched so thin and resisting collaboration pretty early on,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:06">0:59:06-0:59:10</a>:</strong>  mostly just because I was kind of nervous about it and not knowing like how to manage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:10">0:59:10-0:59:11</a>:</strong>  other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:11">0:59:11-0:59:15</a>:</strong>  I was held back really early on by trying to do everything all at once.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:15">0:59:15-0:59:19</a>:</strong>  And like you said, some people can excel that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:19">0:59:19-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  They have the multitasking skills or they just are well organized enough to play all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:25">0:59:25-0:59:26</a>:</strong>  of those out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:26">0:59:26-0:59:31</a>:</strong>  But the thing that I keep coming back to over and over again is that no one can be very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:31">0:59:31-0:59:33</a>:</strong>  good at everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:33">0:59:33-0:59:39</a>:</strong>  Though I consider myself somewhat of a jack of all trades, there's a reason why there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:39">0:59:39-0:59:45</a>:</strong>  a second part to that label being the master of none.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:45">0:59:45-0:59:49</a>:</strong>  It's often kind of disregarded when people try and amass all of these skill sets, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:49">0:59:49-0:59:51</a>:</strong>  in a condensed period of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:51">0:59:51-0:59:57</a>:</strong>  And there's a certain amount of humility and accepting of limitations that I really wish<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:57">0:59:57-0:59:59</a>:</strong>  that I had come to earlier in my career.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=0:59:59">0:59:59-1:00:03</a>:</strong>  I think I probably would have gotten further and been more of an expert in some of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:03">1:00:03-1:00:09</a>:</strong>  things that I excelled at early on, rather than having kind of a competent but somewhat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:09">1:00:09-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  limiting understanding or proficiency in doing all of these other things when trying to deliver<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:18</a>:</strong>  the best quality product or service.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:18">1:00:18-1:00:19</a>:</strong>  Totally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:19">1:00:19-1:00:22</a>:</strong>  And where have you found your niche?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:22">1:00:22-1:00:28</a>:</strong>  Other than just advising others on figuring out what theirs is, what are some of the other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:28">1:00:28-1:00:33</a>:</strong>  things that you have kind of found as guiding principles that have helped you get past some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:33">1:00:33-1:00:37</a>:</strong>  of these hurdles that you've seen perhaps other peers or people in the entrepreneurial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:37">1:00:37-1:00:42</a>:</strong>  side of ecological design sort of stumble on?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:42">1:00:42-1:00:43</a>:</strong>  I love that question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:43">1:00:43-1:00:48</a>:</strong>  So there's two important sides to answer that question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:48">1:00:48-1:00:53</a>:</strong>  First off, knowing yourself as much as you can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:53">1:00:53-1:00:57</a>:</strong>  Not everyone feels like they have a path and not everyone feels like they really understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:57">1:00:57-1:00:58</a>:</strong>  themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:00:58">1:00:58-1:01:02</a>:</strong>  But to the degree that you can understand like where you get excited, what aspect of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:02">1:01:02-1:01:04</a>:</strong>  this work are you excited about?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:04">1:01:04-1:01:07</a>:</strong>  Where do you get turned on?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:07">1:01:07-1:01:13</a>:</strong>  And it's a little cliche to say, but what's your passion, follow your passion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:13">1:01:13-1:01:17</a>:</strong>  This is all about understanding your context of who you are, what your skill set is, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:17">1:01:17-1:01:19</a>:</strong>  you're excited about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:19">1:01:19-1:01:25</a>:</strong>  So first off, you want to spend a little time to identify that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:25">1:01:25-1:01:28</a>:</strong>  And then the other, what I've always done, and I think it's given me an advantage in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:28">1:01:28-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  life is that I am always setting goals way ahead of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:37">1:01:37-1:01:42</a>:</strong>  I do a two year, five year, seven year, 10 year set of goals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:42">1:01:42-1:01:50</a>:</strong>  And once you first understand yourself, but go ahead and think about where you want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:50">1:01:50-1:01:52</a>:</strong>  be in five years with the work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:52">1:01:52-1:01:54</a>:</strong>  Like dream big.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:54">1:01:54-1:01:56</a>:</strong>  I'm always dreaming big.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:01:56">1:01:56-1:02:04</a>:</strong>  And I think that we, it's scary to dream big and often folks don't have the self-confidence<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:04">1:02:04-1:02:09</a>:</strong>  to imagine that you can create that dream, but it's five years from now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:09">1:02:09-1:02:14</a>:</strong>  So who cares whether you have the skill set now or not?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:14">1:02:14-1:02:15</a>:</strong>  What is that five year dream?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:15">1:02:15-1:02:16</a>:</strong>  What is that 10 year dream?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:16">1:02:16-1:02:17</a>:</strong>  Where do you want to be?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:17">1:02:17-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  You know, write it down, work it out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:20</a>:</strong>  What's the world like?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:20">1:02:20-1:02:23</a>:</strong>  What's your role in your work?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:23">1:02:23-1:02:29</a>:</strong>  What's your role in the cultural revolution that we're a part of?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:29">1:02:29-1:02:33</a>:</strong>  Even if it just seems totally unattainable, write that down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:33">1:02:33-1:02:38</a>:</strong>  So this is what I've done for the last 20 years and I, I've got my next 10 years all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:38">1:02:38-1:02:39</a>:</strong>  planned out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:39">1:02:39-1:02:42</a>:</strong>  Then what I do is I reverse engineer from that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:42">1:02:42-1:02:43</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:43">1:02:43-1:02:47</a>:</strong>  So maybe I'll go out to a five year goal and then I start to reverse engineer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:47">1:02:47-1:02:48</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:48">1:02:48-1:02:50</a>:</strong>  What are the skills I'm going to need to get there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:50">1:02:50-1:02:54</a>:</strong>  What kinds of, what kind of team would I need to develop?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:54">1:02:54-1:02:56</a>:</strong>  Where do I need to be in my business?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:56">1:02:56-1:02:57</a>:</strong>  Where do I need to be physically?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:02:57">1:02:57-1:03:00</a>:</strong>  Where do I need to be in my relationships?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:00">1:03:00-1:03:03</a>:</strong>  And I start reverse engineering back from that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:03">1:03:03-1:03:09</a>:</strong>  And as I start to reverse engineer back from my, my dreams there's particulars that come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:09">1:03:09-1:03:12</a>:</strong>  into place like, Oh, this thing's going to have to happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:12">1:03:12-1:03:15</a>:</strong>  I have no skill sets in that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:15">1:03:15-1:03:19</a>:</strong>  So I'm going to, I know I'm going to need to collaborate with someone to do, to fulfill<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:19">1:03:19-1:03:20</a>:</strong>  that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:20">1:03:20-1:03:21</a>:</strong>  What is the skill that I need to learn?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:21">1:03:21-1:03:22</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:22">1:03:22-1:03:27</a>:</strong>  Well, if I have five years to learn that skill, maybe I'll just start really slowly right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:27">1:03:27-1:03:28</a>:</strong>  now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:28">1:03:28-1:03:31</a>:</strong>  You know, maybe once a week I'll pick up a book on that subject or maybe I'll take that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:31">1:03:31-1:03:33</a>:</strong>  online class or something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:33">1:03:33-1:03:37</a>:</strong>  And I'm not going to rush to learn that skill because I'm slowly going to incorporate it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:37">1:03:37-1:03:39</a>:</strong>  into my life and my work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:39">1:03:39-1:03:45</a>:</strong>  I think ultimately what happens, and I did this a lot in my twenties and some of my thirties<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:45">1:03:45-1:03:49</a>:</strong>  and the second half of my thirties, I'm 40 now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:49">1:03:49-1:03:55</a>:</strong>  It started to shift and it's this tension between urgency and patience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:55">1:03:55-1:03:59</a>:</strong>  The urgency comes from the state of the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:03:59">1:03:59-1:04:05</a>:</strong>  It comes from the need to take action now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:05">1:04:05-1:04:11</a>:</strong>  But one of the things I've found that a lot of us do in permaculture movement, activists<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:11">1:04:11-1:04:13</a>:</strong>  do this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:13">1:04:13-1:04:20</a>:</strong>  People do this in general, is when we operate from a place of urgency, we may actually create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:20">1:04:20-1:04:26</a>:</strong>  more harm than good in the process of trying to make that change, whatever it might be,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:26">1:04:26-1:04:33</a>:</strong>  because we don't actually have the skills or the data or the organizations to actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:33">1:04:33-1:04:35</a>:</strong>  make it come true in that short timeframe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:35">1:04:35-1:04:41</a>:</strong>  So there's this side of patience and really it's how, you know, I always get inspiration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:41">1:04:41-1:04:44</a>:</strong>  from a tree, from an old tree or from a forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:44">1:04:44-1:04:50</a>:</strong>  And there's a 250 year old oak tree that I visit about five days a week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:50">1:04:50-1:04:54</a>:</strong>  I hike out to this tree and I visit it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:54">1:04:54-1:04:59</a>:</strong>  And one of the things that that tree has been teaching me lately, as I see all the birds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:04:59">1:04:59-1:05:04</a>:</strong>  that live in that tree and I have gratitude for the abundance of acorns it drops and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:04">1:05:04-1:05:10</a>:</strong>  shade it produces and all the services of carbon sequestration and water filtration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:10">1:05:10-1:05:15</a>:</strong>  and air filtration, all that is that I have to realize, well, you know, it took 250 years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:15">1:05:15-1:05:19</a>:</strong>  for this tree to get here to this level, operating at this level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:19">1:05:19-1:05:21</a>:</strong>  It's not moving so fast today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:21">1:05:21-1:05:23</a>:</strong>  You know, I'll sit at the base of this tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:23">1:05:23-1:05:27</a>:</strong>  This thing isn't running around trying to do a bunch of stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:27">1:05:27-1:05:28</a>:</strong>  It's pretty chill.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:28">1:05:28-1:05:30</a>:</strong>  It's pretty present.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:30">1:05:30-1:05:37</a>:</strong>  So I've shifted in the last few years with my work to give myself more time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:37">1:05:37-1:05:40</a>:</strong>  And one of the things people have said about me in the past is like, I bolt those into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:40">1:05:40-1:05:44</a>:</strong>  life and kind of what that means is that I'm willing to take a lot of risk, always willing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:44">1:05:44-1:05:46</a>:</strong>  to take risks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:46">1:05:46-1:05:52</a>:</strong>  So the combination of taking risk of following the things that excite you and yet at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:52">1:05:52-1:05:59</a>:</strong>  same time, taking time to learn and build skill sets that are necessary to achieve those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:05:59">1:05:59-1:06:01</a>:</strong>  bigger goals in life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:01">1:06:01-1:06:06</a>:</strong>  That's that tension that you have to live in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:06">1:06:06-1:06:15</a>:</strong>  And that is my suggestion for folks getting into this work is you know, you can move some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:15">1:06:15-1:06:22</a>:</strong>  things you can move quickly on and some things take time and what you need to cultivate the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:22">1:06:22-1:06:27</a>:</strong>  skill of perseverance of patience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:27">1:06:27-1:06:34</a>:</strong>  We need to cultivate the skill of taking critical feedback because we live in cultures where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:34">1:06:34-1:06:39</a>:</strong>  we haven't been taught the emotional skills of being strong in ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:39">1:06:39-1:06:46</a>:</strong>  And because there's so much low self-esteem in our cultures these days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:46">1:06:46-1:06:49</a>:</strong>  Technology doesn't help us with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:06:49">1:06:49-1:07:00</a>:</strong>  We have to have the, we need to be able to take feedback because that's what pushes you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:00">1:07:00-1:07:01</a>:</strong>  to learn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:01">1:07:01-1:07:03</a>:</strong>  That shows you where your weak parts are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:03">1:07:03-1:07:06</a>:</strong>  That shows you the gaps and places that you need to fulfill.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:06">1:07:06-1:07:10</a>:</strong>  And I think what happens a lot, and I did this a lot in my life, is that you go out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:10">1:07:10-1:07:15</a>:</strong>  there and you try something and you fail and somebody gives you some critical feedback<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:15">1:07:15-1:07:16</a>:</strong>  about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:16">1:07:16-1:07:20</a>:</strong>  And a lot of people just say, I'm not doing that again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:20">1:07:20-1:07:21</a>:</strong>  Screw that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:21">1:07:21-1:07:22</a>:</strong>  Nope, not for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:22">1:07:22-1:07:25</a>:</strong>  Didn't give me those good feeling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:25">1:07:25-1:07:26</a>:</strong>  I'm done with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:26">1:07:26-1:07:28</a>:</strong>  I'm going to try something different.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:28">1:07:28-1:07:34</a>:</strong>  So a lot of people give up self-rejection before you even had a chance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:34">1:07:34-1:07:37</a>:</strong>  And the regenerative fire is going to burn through you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:37">1:07:37-1:07:38</a>:</strong>  It's going to teach you a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:38">1:07:38-1:07:40</a>:</strong>  It's going to knock you down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:40">1:07:40-1:07:46</a>:</strong>  But those are renewal moments and there's gems in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:46">1:07:46-1:07:52</a>:</strong>  So once you let the emotions, feel the emotions that come up, it's okay to feel upset and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:52">1:07:52-1:07:53</a>:</strong>  whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:53">1:07:53-1:07:58</a>:</strong>  But once those emotions settle, then you need to integrate that feedback.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:07:58">1:07:58-1:08:01</a>:</strong>  Integrate feedback, integrate, not segregate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:01">1:08:01-1:08:02</a>:</strong>  And then you can grow as a person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:02">1:08:02-1:08:06</a>:</strong>  You can grow in your skill set and you can grow in your confidence.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:06">1:08:06-1:08:13</a>:</strong>  And like a 250 year old oak tree that's working its magic, if we want to make big sweeping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:13">1:08:13-1:08:20</a>:</strong>  change in the world and in our lives and as a culture, then we need to have vision that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:20">1:08:20-1:08:23</a>:</strong>  is generational in its scope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:23">1:08:23-1:08:27</a>:</strong>  And if we want to accomplish vision that's generational in its scope, then we need to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:27">1:08:27-1:08:31</a>:</strong>  realize that it's going to take lifetimes to achieve that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:31">1:08:31-1:08:39</a>:</strong>  And once you are humbled by that, you can breathe into the next step and the next step<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:39">1:08:39-1:08:41</a>:</strong>  and the next step and the next step.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:41">1:08:41-1:08:47</a>:</strong>  And you can be in a place of awareness of where you are on your journey and where you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:47">1:08:47-1:08:48</a>:</strong>  need to go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:48">1:08:48-1:08:52</a>:</strong>  And feedback and failure becomes a gift.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:52">1:08:52-1:08:54</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:54">1:08:54-1:08:59</a>:</strong>  Man, there's so many things that I would love to continue to explore and unpack about everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:08:59">1:08:59-1:09:04</a>:</strong>  you just said there, a lot of which has really rang true in my own experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:04">1:09:04-1:09:08</a>:</strong>  One of the main things that I've noticed or kind of sussed out from what you put down<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:08">1:09:08-1:09:17</a>:</strong>  there is the idea of long term planning and the times in treating this perhaps as more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:17">1:09:17-1:09:23</a>:</strong>  of a marathon than a sprint and the differences in decision making that that cultivates in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:23">1:09:23-1:09:30</a>:</strong>  a mindset and how you see your ability to achieve or to complete goals in a much longer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:30">1:09:30-1:09:35</a>:</strong>  term sense, especially when you're working with natural systems, ecosystems, which are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:35">1:09:35-1:09:38</a>:</strong>  going to outlive all of us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:38">1:09:38-1:09:44</a>:</strong>  And whether or not we are able to design in a way that takes into that much larger time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:44">1:09:44-1:09:51</a>:</strong>  frame and think about setting the foundations for nature to take over and to make the better<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:51">1:09:51-1:09:55</a>:</strong>  decisions that we can't predict, certainly not from the smaller vantage point that we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:55">1:09:55-1:09:56</a>:</strong>  at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:09:56">1:09:56-1:10:02</a>:</strong>  But before we run too long on these, and I'd still like to perhaps schedule another interview<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:02">1:10:02-1:10:08</a>:</strong>  or a chat at some point to unpack this further, but could you tell me a little about some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:08">1:10:08-1:10:13</a>:</strong>  of the books that you've been coming out with as well as the educational opportunities that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:13">1:10:13-1:10:17</a>:</strong>  you've been promoting through your different networks and your company?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:17">1:10:17-1:10:18</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:18">1:10:18-1:10:22</a>:</strong>  So at the Permaculture Skills Center, we're a five acre demonstration site in Northern<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:22">1:10:22-1:10:25</a>:</strong>  California.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:25">1:10:25-1:10:27</a>:</strong>  We have two online courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:27">1:10:27-1:10:35</a>:</strong>  We've got the Ecological Landscape Mastery School, where it's a full on program to help<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:35">1:10:35-1:10:39</a>:</strong>  people start and grow their ecological landscape businesses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:39">1:10:39-1:10:44</a>:</strong>  And a lot of things we've talked about here, we talk about in there, but it's really an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:44">1:10:44-1:10:52</a>:</strong>  A to Z of design process, consultation process, client management and relationship.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:52">1:10:52-1:10:57</a>:</strong>  And then all based in permaculture principles and ecological principles, how to create your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:10:57">1:10:57-1:11:01</a>:</strong>  design plan, how to present it, and then how to move into install, how to create budgets,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:01">1:11:01-1:11:06</a>:</strong>  how to talk to clients about money, how to deal with tricky situations running the business,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:06">1:11:06-1:11:09</a>:</strong>  how to manage staff and employees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:09">1:11:09-1:11:15</a>:</strong>  All of that is in the Ecolandscape Mastery School.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:15">1:11:15-1:11:22</a>:</strong>  And then we have our core modules, which have templates, contract templates, and design<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:22">1:11:22-1:11:25</a>:</strong>  workflow process templates and all that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:25">1:11:25-1:11:27</a>:</strong>  And then we also have live sessions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:27">1:11:27-1:11:30</a>:</strong>  Every month I do a case study.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:30">1:11:30-1:11:36</a>:</strong>  Tonight I'm actually doing a case study on a 160 acre broad acre management project that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:36">1:11:36-1:11:38</a>:</strong>  I worked on years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:38">1:11:38-1:11:42</a>:</strong>  But we also do urban case studies, just a full mix.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:42">1:11:42-1:11:47</a>:</strong>  And then we bring experts in to talk about anything from gray water to community organizing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:47">1:11:47-1:11:49</a>:</strong>  to QuickBooks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:49">1:11:49-1:11:55</a>:</strong>  How do you run accounting software to carbon farming to no till farming, kind of like everything,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:11:55">1:11:55-1:12:04</a>:</strong>  all the different pieces of design and regenerative design we cover and all the pieces that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:04">1:12:04-1:12:07</a>:</strong>  incorporated in providing those services to others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:07">1:12:07-1:12:09</a>:</strong>  So that's the Ecolandscape Mastery School.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:09">1:12:09-1:12:16</a>:</strong>  And we have the Regenerative Agroforestry Program with Penny Livingston Stark.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:16">1:12:16-1:12:22</a>:</strong>  And that is a program all about regenerative agroforestry, assessment, design, implementation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:22">1:12:22-1:12:24</a>:</strong>  species management.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:24">1:12:24-1:12:28</a>:</strong>  And we do live sessions once every season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:28">1:12:28-1:12:32</a>:</strong>  But the whole core program is there for folks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:32">1:12:32-1:12:35</a>:</strong>  So those are the educational components that we have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:35">1:12:35-1:12:41</a>:</strong>  And I was talking about that future planning and reverse engineering and all that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:41">1:12:41-1:12:44</a>:</strong>  And so over the last few years, I've written a number of books.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:44">1:12:44-1:12:47</a>:</strong>  I've written a couple of children's books.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:47">1:12:47-1:12:50</a>:</strong>  I produced a couple of educational coloring books.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:50">1:12:50-1:12:55</a>:</strong>  I came out with a personal development book called Activate Your Joy, which talks a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:12:55">1:12:55-1:13:02</a>:</strong>  about some of the things we discussed about self-confidence, about context, about future<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:02">1:13:02-1:13:04</a>:</strong>  planning, reverse engineering, all that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:04">1:13:04-1:13:08</a>:</strong>  And then I just came out with the Ecological Landscape Professional, which is really a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:08">1:13:08-1:13:15</a>:</strong>  book that distills all the aspects of how to take permaculture and traditional landscaping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:15">1:13:15-1:13:20</a>:</strong>  and integrate them together in a system so that we can create businesses that regenerate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:20">1:13:20-1:13:23</a>:</strong>  the planet and care for people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:23">1:13:23-1:13:25</a>:</strong>  That book just came out this year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:25">1:13:25-1:13:33</a>:</strong>  What I'm working on now is both in the world of fiction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:33">1:13:33-1:13:39</a>:</strong>  I'm working on some projects right now that I can't talk too much about them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:39">1:13:39-1:13:43</a>:</strong>  Part of the goal here is how do we shift the culture?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:43">1:13:43-1:13:49</a>:</strong>  How do we tell story in such a way that connects people back to nature, that vision's a new<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:49">1:13:49-1:13:57</a>:</strong>  world, that vision's a way out of the current destructive practices that we have and recognizing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:57">1:13:57-1:13:59</a>:</strong>  that we are a species of story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:13:59">1:13:59-1:14:01</a>:</strong>  We follow story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:01">1:14:01-1:14:06</a>:</strong>  And it is in some ways the narrative of our culture are the kinds of media that people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:06">1:14:06-1:14:07</a>:</strong>  are consuming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:07">1:14:07-1:14:14</a>:</strong>  And right now, a lot of the media that people consume are heavily racist, heavily violent,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:14">1:14:14-1:14:17</a>:</strong>  dystopian.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:17">1:14:17-1:14:24</a>:</strong>  And so can we breathe fresh air into our cultural storytelling that integrates the tools and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:24">1:14:24-1:14:33</a>:</strong>  the connective way of being that's required for us as a culture to find peace again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:33">1:14:33-1:14:35</a>:</strong>  That's my main project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:35">1:14:35-1:14:36</a>:</strong>  I'm working on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:36">1:14:36-1:14:39</a>:</strong>  And then this is my first time telling anyone this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:39">1:14:39-1:14:43</a>:</strong>  I also have a big regenerative landscape book that I'm in the process on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:43">1:14:43-1:14:49</a>:</strong>  So in the next couple of years, probably two to three years, those will start coming out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:49">1:14:49-1:14:50</a>:</strong>  and I'll talk more about them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:50">1:14:50-1:14:52</a>:</strong>  Fantastic, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:52">1:14:52-1:14:57</a>:</strong>  Those sound like really exciting projects and I can't wait to see as they update and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:57">1:14:57-1:14:58</a>:</strong>  start to come out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:14:58">1:14:58-1:15:02</a>:</strong>  Well, again, Eric, thank you so much for being so generous with your time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:02">1:15:02-1:15:05</a>:</strong>  As always, whenever we chat or catch up, I got a whole lot out of this and I think it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:05">1:15:05-1:15:08</a>:</strong>  going to be really important for the audience as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:08">1:15:08-1:15:13</a>:</strong>  So I'll leave it at that and hopefully we can schedule another session soon in the future<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:13">1:15:13-1:15:15</a>:</strong>  to catch up again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:15">1:15:15-1:15:16</a>:</strong>  I would love that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:16">1:15:16-1:15:19</a>:</strong>  Thanks so much for the opportunity and I appreciate all the good work you're doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:19">1:15:19-1:15:20</a>:</strong>  Thanks so much, Eric.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:20">1:15:20-1:15:21</a>:</strong>  Take care.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:21">1:15:21-1:15:22</a>:</strong>  Bye.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:15:51">1:15:51-1:15:52</a>:</strong>  Bye.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-erik-ohlsen-1/#t=1:16:21">1:16:21-1:16:45</a>:</strong>  Thank you so much for listening and I'll see you again in next week's session.  </p>
