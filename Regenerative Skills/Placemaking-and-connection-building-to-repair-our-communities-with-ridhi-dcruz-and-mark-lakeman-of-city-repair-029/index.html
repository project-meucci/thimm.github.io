<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:25">0:01:25-0:01:29</a>:</strong>  Alright, I have an extra special interview for all of you today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:29">0:01:29-0:01:34</a>:</strong>  In this episode I've got not one, but two visionary changemakers from the community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:34">0:01:34-0:01:39</a>:</strong>  restoration non-profit City Repair, which is based in Portland, Oregon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:39">0:01:39-0:01:44</a>:</strong>  I've got Riddhi D'Cruise, the Village Coalition organizer, and the founder of City Repair,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:44">0:01:44-0:01:46</a>:</strong>  Mark Lakeman.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:46">0:01:46-0:01:51</a>:</strong>  They each come from very different backgrounds, but have united to foster thriving, inclusive,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:51">0:01:51-0:01:56</a>:</strong>  and sustainable communities through the creative reclamation of public space.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:01:56">0:01:56-0:02:01</a>:</strong>  City Repair also facilitates artistic and ecologically oriented placemaking through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:01">0:02:01-0:02:06</a>:</strong>  projects that honor the interconnection of human communities and the natural world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:06">0:02:06-0:02:10</a>:</strong>  Now I know that all sounds a bit complicated, but what's really worth knowing is that a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:10">0:02:10-0:02:15</a>:</strong>  large part of their projects involve permaculture garden installations and community spaces<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:15">0:02:15-0:02:19</a>:</strong>  built with natural materials, all in urban environments where those types of projects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:19">0:02:19-0:02:22</a>:</strong>  have traditionally been hard to get approved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:22">0:02:22-0:02:27</a>:</strong>  In this interview, Mark and Riddhi go in depth about the concept of placemaking and why it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:27">0:02:27-0:02:30</a>:</strong>  so essential in our modern communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:30">0:02:30-0:02:34</a>:</strong>  Mark gives incredible insights on the history of colonial advancement through the Americas<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:34">0:02:34-0:02:39</a>:</strong>  and how it's shaped the landscape and our environment into one that isolates us from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:39">0:02:39-0:02:40</a>:</strong>  one another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:40">0:02:40-0:02:44</a>:</strong>  Riddhi goes on to explain their annual event called the Village Building Convergence and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:44">0:02:44-0:02:48</a>:</strong>  how their work has already had an amazing impact on the interconnectedness of people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:48">0:02:48-0:02:52</a>:</strong>  that they've worked with in unexpected ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:52">0:02:52-0:02:57</a>:</strong>  At the end, both of them give invaluable advice on how you can take up the mantle and effectively<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:02:57">0:02:57-0:03:01</a>:</strong>  create and facilitate connections in your own community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:01">0:03:01-0:03:03</a>:</strong>  The answers may surprise you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:03">0:03:03-0:03:07</a>:</strong>  But before I give anything away, I'll turn things over to Riddhi D'Cruz and Mark Lakeman.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:20">0:03:20-0:03:24</a>:</strong>  Could you both introduce yourselves just a little and tell us a little bit about your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:24">0:03:24-0:03:28</a>:</strong>  backgrounds and how you came to work with City Repair?<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:29">0:03:29-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  I first heard about City Repair in India from a co-participant in a natural building workshop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:46</a>:</strong>  I told him that I had been considering grad school in Portland.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:46">0:03:46-0:03:53</a>:</strong>  There were just various things that were drawing me towards Oregon, mostly awesome people who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:53">0:03:53-0:03:57</a>:</strong>  had the spirit of the forest in their step in India.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:03:57">0:03:57-0:04:01</a>:</strong>  And so yeah, he said, Oh, wow, you're going to Portland.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:02</a>:</strong>  Have you heard of City Repair?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:02">0:04:02-0:04:04</a>:</strong>  And I was like, no.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:08</a>:</strong>  And then he said, Oh, my gosh, it's right up your alley.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:08">0:04:08-0:04:13</a>:</strong>  And sure enough, I looked it up and, you know, I was painting walls with friends in India<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:13">0:04:13-0:04:21</a>:</strong>  to kind of as a response to rapid urbanization in my city and what I thought was the commoditization<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:21">0:04:21-0:04:22</a>:</strong>  of relationships.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:22">0:04:22-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  Like everything was transactional and money oriented and disorienting for me growing up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:32</a>:</strong>  in a more place-based culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:32">0:04:32-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  So I feel like that and a series of other decisions and choices led to me ending up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:50</a>:</strong>  in Portland and yeah, and then it was inevitable that I would get involved with City Repair.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:50">0:04:50-0:04:53</a>:</strong>  And I did grad school in anthropology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:04:53">0:04:53-0:05:03</a>:</strong>  And also part of why I chose Portland was to understand how urban planning and sustainability<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:03">0:05:03-0:05:15</a>:</strong>  can work in ways to ensure that we have a life that's both justice oriented, but also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:15">0:05:15-0:05:22</a>:</strong>  that's and to people and to the planet as well, you know, so kind of well rounded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:22">0:05:22-0:05:29</a>:</strong>  And I'm finding my exploration and that continues outside of school.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:29">0:05:29-0:05:30</a>:</strong>  And there's a lot of work to be done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:30">0:05:30-0:05:34</a>:</strong>  You know, I know that many people consider Portland a model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:34">0:05:34-0:05:40</a>:</strong>  I also challenge that because I feel like there are ways that my background in India<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:46</a>:</strong>  and my upbringing and my culture and other cultures have are very vital in informing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:46">0:05:46-0:05:48</a>:</strong>  what we have going here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:48">0:05:48-0:05:49</a>:</strong>  Fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:49">0:05:49-0:05:51</a>:</strong>  That's a lovely story and very serendipitous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:51">0:05:51-0:05:53</a>:</strong>  How about you, Mark?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:53">0:05:53-0:05:55</a>:</strong>  Well, let's see.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:05:55">0:05:55-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  I like to I like to kind of give credit to people who have been involved in activism<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:10</a>:</strong>  long before us, because part of my role in helping to get City Repair going back in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:10">0:06:10-0:06:20</a>:</strong>  mid 90s was to kind of gather ideas and sort of even, you might say, threads of of culture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:20">0:06:20-0:06:30</a>:</strong>  and of of initiatives that were already underway and try to kind of, I would say, restate them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:30">0:06:30-0:06:37</a>:</strong>  in a way where where things were kind of brought together into maybe a new iteration or a new<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:37">0:06:37-0:06:38</a>:</strong>  version.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:38">0:06:38-0:06:45</a>:</strong>  So, you know, we've been doing what you might call placemaking now in Portland for a while<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:45">0:06:45-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  to birth participatory culture and to reclaim space and transform it into gathering places<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:06:54">0:06:54-0:07:02</a>:</strong>  for community beginning most, I think, dramatically with Pioneer Square.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:02">0:07:02-0:07:09</a>:</strong>  So I, you know, in a way City Repair began officially with the efforts in the mid 90s,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:09">0:07:09-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  but really the parts and pieces that make it up were all created by other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  I mean, just like a poet invents a poem, they're still using structures and language that were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:27</a>:</strong>  invented by others and in many ways, metaphors that have been been tried before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:27">0:07:27-0:07:35</a>:</strong>  So I think, you know, the ongoing cause of, you know, creating a more a more place based<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:35">0:07:35-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  social justice oriented culture has been going on for a very, very long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:46</a>:</strong>  In fact, it's probably the basis of of human culture, of human habitat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:46">0:07:46-0:07:53</a>:</strong>  You know, we like to all talk about villages because we identify with them so strongly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:53">0:07:53-0:07:56</a>:</strong>  because of the way that working and living is integrated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:07:56">0:07:56-0:08:03</a>:</strong>  And I think so, you know, I think that what we've been doing and what what I helped contribute<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:03">0:08:03-0:08:12</a>:</strong>  to in the mid 90s was to try to restore the value of a village in Portland and then and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:12">0:08:12-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  then try to create a model that would inspire other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  And then I think that's what what really heard about the rest of what I'll say is just that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:27</a>:</strong>  I think if we were smart about anything back then in the mid 90s, it was that we knew that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:27">0:08:27-0:08:33</a>:</strong>  we didn't know everything and that what we had to create had to be open ended and essentially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:33">0:08:33-0:08:37</a>:</strong>  complimentary so that when Riddhi arrived, we became more complete.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:43</a>:</strong>  Just like everyone else who steps into city repair, we we start to learn more and know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:43">0:08:43-0:08:47</a>:</strong>  more about what we're trying to do as everyone arrives and adds their their piece.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:48">0:08:48-0:08:52</a>:</strong>  I really like that way of explaining it as a multi-level collaboration for those who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:52">0:08:52-0:08:56</a>:</strong>  came before and those who keep continuing to join and add to the whole.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:56">0:08:56-0:08:58</a>:</strong>  Now, you mentioned a concept called placemaking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:08:59">0:08:59-0:09:04</a>:</strong>  Could you talk a little bit about this concept and what does it mean to each of you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:04">0:09:04-0:09:07</a>:</strong>  And why is it so important to our communities these days?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:08">0:09:08-0:09:09</a>:</strong>  Riddhi, do you want to start on that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:10">0:09:10-0:09:18</a>:</strong>  OK. The way I look at it, Oliver, is, you know, I'm kind of annoyed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:18">0:09:18-0:09:21</a>:</strong>  I'm going to out myself in that, but I'll try to bridge it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:21">0:09:21-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  I look at colonization in terms of time and space compression, one component of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:29">0:09:29-0:09:35</a>:</strong>  And what that means is that it like time becomes a commodity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:35">0:09:35-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  Like, you know, it's like, oh, I got to work to earn money to live this life or I don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:42</a>:</strong>  have time to go into the woods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:42">0:09:42-0:09:43</a>:</strong>  I don't have time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:43">0:09:43-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  All this busy stuff, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:45">0:09:45-0:09:49</a>:</strong>  Like trying to keep keep up and then space as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:49">0:09:49-0:09:58</a>:</strong>  At least in Portland, we're seeing this more and more where free space or unutilized space<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:09:58">0:09:58-0:10:04</a>:</strong>  or things that are of just public benefit are getting less and less because there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:04">0:10:04-0:10:07</a>:</strong>  so much, it's prime real estate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:07">0:10:07-0:10:13</a>:</strong>  So land is getting privatized and commoditized in a really intense way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:13">0:10:13-0:10:20</a>:</strong>  And what that creates for a human being and a human experience is, I think, this kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:20">0:10:20-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  of fractured, frenetic and disorienting experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:36</a>:</strong>  And so for me, placemaking is at the spiritual level, it's answering the question, like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:36">0:10:36-0:10:41</a>:</strong>  what is my place in this universe, in this life in relation to other life?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:41">0:10:41-0:10:43</a>:</strong>  So there's that component.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:51</a>:</strong>  And then it's also kind of working to reclaim my place, like physically the land and my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:10:51">0:10:51-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  time and how I inhabit my life in the more material sense from ways that it has been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:00">0:11:00-0:11:06</a>:</strong>  taken away or kind of constrained and forced into certain ways and like life practices<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:06">0:11:06-0:11:10</a>:</strong>  that I don't find conducive to my spirit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:10">0:11:10-0:11:11</a>:</strong>  And to our collective spirit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:11">0:11:11-0:11:16</a>:</strong>  So that to me is the two levels I see placemaking operating at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:17</a>:</strong>  Excellent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  And Mark?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:26</a>:</strong>  Well, I'd start off by agreeing with Riddhi that especially in the American context or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:26">0:11:26-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  Western hemispheric context of colonialism, placemaking has to be understood in that context.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:35">0:11:35-0:11:40</a>:</strong>  So, you know, let's see, I want to be able to give a simple definition, though.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  I'll just try by saying placemaking is the restoration of participation at the local<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:11:50</a>:</strong>  You could say that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:51">0:11:51-0:11:57</a>:</strong>  And so to contrast that with colonialism, what we find typically in American neighborhoods<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:11:57">0:11:57-0:12:07</a>:</strong>  is that very strangely, unlike the thousands and thousands of years of otherwise human<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:07">0:12:07-0:12:12</a>:</strong>  history, in American neighborhoods, we find that we don't have power where we live to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:12">0:12:12-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  make decisions together, or at least that's how it seems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:16">0:12:16-0:12:18</a>:</strong>  And we don't have gathering places commonly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:19">0:12:19-0:12:25</a>:</strong>  Living within colonialism has resulted in the fact that American neighborhoods are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:25">0:12:25-0:12:31</a>:</strong>  characteristically merely developments created for profit by developers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:31">0:12:31-0:12:37</a>:</strong>  So we live in their economic and mental landscape, the void of their spiritual landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:38">0:12:38-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  And this is expressed particularly by the absence of gathering places in American communities,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:51</a>:</strong>  in Western hemispheric communities, but especially in the United States, where we actually have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:51">0:12:51-0:12:56</a>:</strong>  the lowest number of community gathering places of all First World nations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:12:56">0:12:56-0:13:02</a>:</strong>  And because of that isolation, we've been able to establish not just those of us who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:02">0:13:02-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  do placemaking, but academics and sociologists, anthropologists, public health officials,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  and researchers have been able to establish that so many of our dystopic kind of, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:26</a>:</strong>  normative kind of patterns of life in American communities are resulting from our isolation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:26">0:13:26-0:13:32</a>:</strong>  So we have about 10 times higher crime rates across the board than countries that we have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:32">0:13:32-0:13:37</a>:</strong>  so much to do with that our ancestors came from or that we trade with economically or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:37">0:13:37-0:13:39</a>:</strong>  we interact with politically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:39">0:13:39-0:13:42</a>:</strong>  We have 10 times higher crime rates across the board.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:42">0:13:42-0:13:46</a>:</strong>  We literally kill each other and rape each other and steal from each other more freely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:46">0:13:46-0:13:49</a>:</strong>  and we're killing each other more frequently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:49">0:13:49-0:13:51</a>:</strong>  And there's reasons for this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:51">0:13:51-0:13:54</a>:</strong>  It's not just something about the wild American character.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:13:54">0:13:54-0:14:01</a>:</strong>  It's that those countries that we might identify with as our own ancestral base, largely were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:01">0:14:01-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  created, those landscapes were created by the people that inhabit them as a way of simply<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:08</a>:</strong>  meeting their needs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:08">0:14:08-0:14:13</a>:</strong>  But in the USA, if you live in a neighborhood like say, especially a place like suburban<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:13">0:14:13-0:14:20</a>:</strong>  bus, you're living in a vast tract of housing created for profit without even one bench<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:20">0:14:20-0:14:26</a>:</strong>  to sit on, maybe not even any bus service and certainly not a single public square because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:26">0:14:26-0:14:32</a>:</strong>  it was all laid out for profit by a developer with an architect helping funded by a banker<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:32">0:14:32-0:14:37</a>:</strong>  and none of them interested in creating a public square because for one thing, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:37">0:14:37-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  harder to sell that kind of thing to the community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:40">0:14:40-0:14:47</a>:</strong>  And for another thing, you know, those sorts of interests don't want communities to have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:47">0:14:47-0:14:51</a>:</strong>  a way, not just a social space, but a social organism.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:51">0:14:51-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  Like if you were trying to sell them a public square, they would have to get together in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:14:58</a>:</strong>  order to buy it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:14:58">0:14:58-0:15:02</a>:</strong>  And the last thing that development culture wants is for us to get together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:02">0:15:02-0:15:05</a>:</strong>  I mean, this isn't a new thing either.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:05">0:15:05-0:15:11</a>:</strong>  This is at the very, this is written into the National Land Ordinance of 1785, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:11">0:15:11-0:15:16</a>:</strong>  was when these kinds of patterns and practices were basically embedded in the history of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:16">0:15:16-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  our country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:22</a>:</strong>  The idea that we would just simply grid off the continent all the way to the Pacific Ocean<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:22">0:15:22-0:15:30</a>:</strong>  and decide that it would all be transformed in a negative way from being characterized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:30">0:15:30-0:15:35</a>:</strong>  by the patterns and lives of native people who had lived there for thousands of years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:35">0:15:35-0:15:43</a>:</strong>  and instead to actually plan in that document to eliminate them, to reduce them, and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:43">0:15:43-0:15:49</a>:</strong>  to convert their commonly held land into a commodity that could be sold off in little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:49">0:15:49-0:15:49</a>:</strong>  parcels.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:50">0:15:50-0:15:56</a>:</strong>  So, I mean, the story goes on and on and on, but the fact is, you know, functionally speaking,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:15:56">0:15:56-0:16:02</a>:</strong>  it results in the lives that we live today being characterized by isolation and the highest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:02">0:16:02-0:16:03</a>:</strong>  rates of violence.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:03">0:16:03-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  And it's deeper than that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:10</a>:</strong>  The kinds of phobias that we experience as individuals, the personal challenges that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:10">0:16:10-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  we have that seem insolvable are also very much rooted in this kind of approach to creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:21</a>:</strong>  an anti-cultural condition for living.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:21">0:16:21-0:16:27</a>:</strong>  So placemaking has to take this into consideration, and it's not hard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:28">0:16:28-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  If people are divided and isolated, and then you as a placemaker are working in a community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:38</a>:</strong>  knowing that it is their very nature to actually know each other and work together and solve<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:38">0:16:38-0:16:43</a>:</strong>  their own problems, then you can know before you even get started that as soon as you get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:43">0:16:43-0:16:46</a>:</strong>  started, everybody's hearts are going to be opening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:46">0:16:46-0:16:48</a>:</strong>  They're going to be having epiphanies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:48">0:16:48-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  They're even going to be acting a little crazy because they won't be able to believe or understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:16:55</a>:</strong>  how wonderful they are feeling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:17:02</a>:</strong>  So as a placemaker, you're bringing people together into kind of a scale of an organism<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:02">0:17:02-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  of community that used to characterize our lives for at least 100,000 years in a very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:13</a>:</strong>  basic way, and that still forms the foundation of our nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:14">0:17:14-0:17:17</a>:</strong>  So I'll just stop there, but that's a bit of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:17">0:17:17-0:17:19</a>:</strong>  That's a bit of how we talk about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:19">0:17:19-0:17:25</a>:</strong>  Well, that's absolutely fascinating, and I agree, absolutely essential as well to creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:26">0:17:26-0:17:28</a>:</strong>  healthy and vibrant communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:28">0:17:28-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  Now, for both of you, but especially Riddhi, having come from a culture and a place in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:38</a>:</strong>  the world where community space is still highly valued and a very active part of life there,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:41</a>:</strong>  where do you draw some of your inspirations?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:41">0:17:41-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  And I guess for both of you, what informs the designs and the efforts that you make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  in order to recreate these essential and communal places in a city like Portland, Oregon?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:17:55">0:17:55-0:18:03</a>:</strong>  Well, Oliver, like one thing I want to say is like, you know, India is a subcontinent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:03">0:18:03-0:18:07</a>:</strong>  and we've had lots of visitors, to put it one way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:07">0:18:07-0:18:12</a>:</strong>  And then we were also colonized by the British, the Dutch, the French, the Portuguese.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:12">0:18:12-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  A lot of folks have come over.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:17</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, English is my first language.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:20</a>:</strong>  I grew up with a lot of privilege in terms of class.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:21">0:18:21-0:18:23</a>:</strong>  So I grew up Roman Catholic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:32</a>:</strong>  So I'm going to throw that all in there because just to kind of paint a really complex picture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:32">0:18:32-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  of what's happening in India, where, yes, there's like definitely, I think, a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  like public space and we have banyan trees that I remember growing up and seeing people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  congregating around in more rural parts of India.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:49">0:18:49-0:18:56</a>:</strong>  And at the same time, we also have a lot of Western ways and like, you know, I don't know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:18:56">0:18:56-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  it's just complicated to say where East and West divide and meet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  Certainly in the modern times as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:05">0:19:05-0:19:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah, very complicated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:06">0:19:06-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  And then, you know, the history is we, we had, we opened our market, we had a protectionist<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:17</a>:</strong>  economy, then we opened it up in the 90s.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:17">0:19:17-0:19:20</a>:</strong>  And so then globalization came in a big way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:23</a>:</strong>  And so, yeah, there's, there's a lot of factors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:23">0:19:23-0:19:33</a>:</strong>  But I would say to get back to your question that, that one way that I try to design spaces<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:33">0:19:33-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  is, you know, in the human realm, I try to look at what the different needs and voices<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  and perspectives are so that, you know, like truly looking at, like, does this work for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:45</a>:</strong>  me?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:45">0:19:45-0:19:47</a>:</strong>  Does this work for other people's needs?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:47">0:19:47-0:19:49</a>:</strong>  Like, what, what are we trying to do and accomplish?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:49">0:19:49-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  And how can people feel safe and be set up to thrive in some ways?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:57</a>:</strong>  Like, what's that happy medium?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:19:58">0:19:58-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  And then also looking at that for the non-human world, like, what does that mean for birds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:11</a>:</strong>  and animals passing through, or just ecology and the environment in general?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:11">0:20:11-0:20:20</a>:</strong>  And then the other part, which might sound a little strange, or woo woo, as I sometimes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:20">0:20:20-0:20:27</a>:</strong>  hear people refer to it, but I think that if we listen, the like, sometimes I can get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:27">0:20:27-0:20:32</a>:</strong>  a sense of what the land wants to be, you know, and it might be energetic, like, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:32">0:20:32-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  just the way it's just, for lack of a better word, it's, it makes sense, you know, like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:37">0:20:37-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  oh yeah, this wants to be, this is where the shed should go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:42</a>:</strong>  It just makes sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:42">0:20:42-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  So I don't know, I feel like there's, there's ways that you can, you can go to school for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:20:54</a>:</strong>  some of these things, like for anthropology, for urban planning and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:54">0:20:54-0:20:58</a>:</strong>  And they do teach us really useful skills.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:20:58">0:20:58-0:21:03</a>:</strong>  And at the same time, I strongly believe that it's just hardwired into our DNA.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:03">0:21:03-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  We've like lived from and off and with this, this earth for a really long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:13</a>:</strong>  So it's just, it's just kind of in us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:13">0:21:13-0:21:22</a>:</strong>  And I do think we can get confused and, or not be able to, or we don't feel confident.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:22">0:21:22-0:21:25</a>:</strong>  Like we feel like, oh, we don't really know these things, I have to go to school to learn<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:25">0:21:25-0:21:25</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:25">0:21:25-0:21:29</a>:</strong>  But I really believe that it's there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:29">0:21:29-0:21:35</a>:</strong>  And it's just, if we get out of our own way and that it's there for us to kind of use<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:35">0:21:35-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  as our guiding voice and our design principles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  Fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  I really liked the way you spelled that out because it gives a lot of sort of empowerment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  and inspiration to people who maybe don't have a formal education in this, that perhaps<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:57</a>:</strong>  their intuition and their own feelings could guide them well enough to create these, these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:21:57">0:21:57-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  spaces for themselves and for their community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:01</a>:</strong>  How about you, Mark?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:01">0:22:01-0:22:04</a>:</strong>  Where do you draw your inspiration?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:04">0:22:04-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  Well, let's see.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:13</a>:</strong>  I think I would start by just agreeing with what you just said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:13">0:22:13-0:22:20</a>:</strong>  A lot of the choices that I make are, well, choices that I make are ultimately all confirmed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:20">0:22:20-0:22:22</a>:</strong>  by how I feel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:22">0:22:22-0:22:27</a>:</strong>  There's so many choices that you can make with respect to design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:27">0:22:27-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  Even like one of my favorite roles to play these days is to support the design initiative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  of others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:39</a>:</strong>  Because frankly, when I'm designing, I can already visualize what it is I'm trying to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:39">0:22:39-0:22:44</a>:</strong>  create, which means the rest of the time I'm kind of producing it, which is kind of fun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:44">0:22:44-0:22:50</a>:</strong>  But it's nothing compared to supporting and assisting other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:50">0:22:50-0:22:57</a>:</strong>  In their process of kind of arriving at their creative capacity, their ability to express<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:57">0:22:57-0:22:58</a>:</strong>  themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:22:58">0:22:58-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  So I get to witness that unfolding or flowering, you might say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:10</a>:</strong>  And it's got scales of satisfaction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:10">0:23:10-0:23:14</a>:</strong>  You get to watch people having this experience as individuals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:14">0:23:14-0:23:20</a>:</strong>  You get to watch mothers working with their children, facilitating their involvement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:20">0:23:20-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  And then you get to see all of these people working as a group, discovering their deeper<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:31</a>:</strong>  identity with each other, their broader, larger identity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:31">0:23:31-0:23:44</a>:</strong>  And it brings me sometimes to my knees with joy and joy in the way that I'm trying to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:44">0:23:44-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  just an overwhelming emotion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:48">0:23:48-0:23:58</a>:</strong>  And it's hard to even describe quite how I feel about it, because what I'm tapping into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:23:58">0:23:58-0:24:09</a>:</strong>  in myself is not just my personal experience, but in order to help start City Repair, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:09">0:24:09-0:24:17</a>:</strong>  had to go around and travel for many years, basically going around to different indigenous<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  conditions, different places.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:20">0:24:20-0:24:26</a>:</strong>  Basically, I was asking what is wrong with me and what is wrong with my society.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:33</a>:</strong>  And whether I was visiting Mayan people or Egyptians during Ramadan, everybody was so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:33">0:24:33-0:24:42</a>:</strong>  startled and moved and sort of overjoyed even to be asked by a white man for their perspective<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:42">0:24:42-0:24:45</a>:</strong>  on Western culture, the United States in particular.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:46">0:24:46-0:24:53</a>:</strong>  So your question about where does my inspiration come from, it very largely comes from not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:53">0:24:53-0:24:58</a>:</strong>  just the fact that I got all these multiple perspectives and literally sets of advice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:24:58">0:24:58-0:25:03</a>:</strong>  over and over again about how to understand colonialism and the intellectual<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:03">0:25:03-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  and the intentional disruption of culture, which characterizes the history of our country<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:12</a>:</strong>  and about which we are so much in denial.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  But it's only part of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:22</a>:</strong>  I mean, what really propels me is the brotherhood and sisterhood that was offered to me as I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:22">0:25:22-0:25:26</a>:</strong>  went around seeking to be accountable for my kind, for my people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:26">0:25:26-0:25:32</a>:</strong>  And people were so receptive and happy to share their perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:32">0:25:32-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  And for that, I got a lot of growthful fertilizer for my soul.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:40">0:25:40-0:25:48</a>:</strong>  So when I'm watching us, when I'm helping to, I guess, apply that advice, like say I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:25:53</a>:</strong>  in a neighborhood and I walk into the circumstance already knowing that everyone's isolated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:53">0:25:53-0:25:54</a>:</strong>  and they don't know it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:54">0:25:54-0:25:55</a>:</strong>  It's so normative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:55">0:25:55-0:25:56</a>:</strong>  They don't even know it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:25:57">0:25:57-0:26:01</a>:</strong>  And then yet again, I get to be part of helping people sit down and just begin to speak to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:01">0:26:01-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:02">0:26:02-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  And I'm sitting there knowing that they can, that it's within their capacity within a few<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  minutes to reactivate all these faculties that they have used for thousands of years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:19</a>:</strong>  in their ancestry to actually speak and listen to each other and then fuse together their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:19">0:26:19-0:26:24</a>:</strong>  metaphors and their references and their memories into an expression of their kind of cumulative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:24">0:26:24-0:26:28</a>:</strong>  or their collaborative self.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:28">0:26:28-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  And it works every time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:34</a>:</strong>  Even, and you can witness so many different ways that it happens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:34">0:26:34-0:26:41</a>:</strong>  Like if there's a disruptive person there intending to stop them, you know that they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:41">0:26:41-0:26:44</a>:</strong>  are just being a villager trying to defend their sense of place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:44">0:26:44-0:26:50</a>:</strong>  And if you continue to feed that, the goodness of that, the nimbi can become a powerful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:50">0:26:50-0:26:55</a>:</strong>  supporter and ally rather than just trying to fight against them and stop them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:26:56">0:26:56-0:27:02</a>:</strong>  If you understand them more deeply, then you can help them to awaken to what they're really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:02">0:27:02-0:27:05</a>:</strong>  trying to do, which is that they really care about the village.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:06">0:27:06-0:27:10</a>:</strong>  They don't just want to defend the only thing that, the only ways that they know, the only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:10">0:27:10-0:27:14</a>:</strong>  patterns that they know, but they, that they care about it deeply enough to actually start<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:14">0:27:14-0:27:15</a>:</strong>  becoming creative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:15">0:27:15-0:27:22</a>:</strong>  So when I see this playing out, and then I remember the moments of the empathy and compassion<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:22">0:27:22-0:27:23</a>:</strong>  that were extended to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:25">0:27:25-0:27:33</a>:</strong>  It, it makes me think of those people that I was visiting and just remember their love<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:33">0:27:33-0:27:34</a>:</strong>  and their kindness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:34">0:27:34-0:27:40</a>:</strong>  And that's an inspiration for me that has really opened up, I guess metaphorically speaking,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:40">0:27:40-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  I feel like I was an artist before I thought I was a real badass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:51</a>:</strong>  I could draw like a maniac, but I was nothing compared to who I am now that I have started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:51">0:27:51-0:27:58</a>:</strong>  to find satisfaction so much more satisfaction in helping support the emergence of other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:58">0:27:58-0:27:59</a>:</strong>  people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:27:59">0:27:59-0:28:05</a>:</strong>  It's opened up my creative capacity in ways that were unimaginable to me before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:06">0:28:06-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  And I could do so much more individually, but now I'm capable of things I never could<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:15</a>:</strong>  have imagined before it became like this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:15">0:28:15-0:28:21</a>:</strong>  So I guess one thing that is also very propelling in this just kind of like perpetual motion<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:22">0:28:22-0:28:28</a>:</strong>  is the personal transformation effects of doing this kind of work are restorative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:28">0:28:28-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  They grow your capacity as a leader.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:32">0:28:32-0:28:34</a>:</strong>  They help you to be sincerely humble.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:34">0:28:34-0:28:40</a>:</strong>  They calm your heart issues that you might have been carrying for years and years disperse.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:40">0:28:40-0:28:45</a>:</strong>  And they disperse because you're finally more in alignment with your own nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:45">0:28:45-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  Of course, you're going to be phobic if you're running around thinking you're alone in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:50</a>:</strong>  world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:50">0:28:50-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  And of course, you're going to start to become a healthier person as you're interacting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:54">0:28:54-0:28:56</a>:</strong>  with increasingly healthy people all around you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:29:01</a>:</strong>  So it's a very restorative process that is self renewing, I would say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:01">0:29:01-0:29:05</a>:</strong>  And it's also very possible for you to exhaust yourself and burn yourself out at the same<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:05">0:29:05-0:29:06</a>:</strong>  time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:07">0:29:07-0:29:08</a>:</strong>  So it's complicated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:08">0:29:08-0:29:12</a>:</strong>  But the inspiration can come from anyone, anywhere, anytime, I would say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:13">0:29:13-0:29:16</a>:</strong>  Certainly, that's a very valuable perspective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:16">0:29:16-0:29:21</a>:</strong>  And that also echoes a lot of my own experiences as I've been traveling internationally and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:21">0:29:21-0:29:26</a>:</strong>  actually where I'm living right now here in rural Guatemala in a small indigenous town<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:26">0:29:26-0:29:27</a>:</strong>  in the highlands.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:27">0:29:27-0:29:29</a>:</strong>  My God, where are you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:29">0:29:29-0:29:31</a>:</strong>  I am in Sununan, Lake Atitlan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  Oh my gosh.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:33">0:29:33-0:29:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's one of the places I've been.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:37">0:29:37-0:29:40</a>:</strong>  That's one of the places where I was for a while.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:40">0:29:40-0:29:41</a>:</strong>  Yeah, a lot of people have passed through here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:41">0:29:41-0:29:47</a>:</strong>  It's been a congregation point for a lot of good ideas and well, actually, a lot of war<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:47">0:29:47-0:29:48</a>:</strong>  in the past, too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:48">0:29:48-0:29:52</a>:</strong>  So there's a lot of energy and a lot of history to this place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:52">0:29:52-0:29:57</a>:</strong>  But yeah, I'm very fortunate to be in a small town that has been largely untouched through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:57">0:29:57-0:29:59</a>:</strong>  a lot of these events over history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:29:59">0:29:59-0:30:05</a>:</strong>  In fact, the main language spoken in the town is Cachical and Spanish is a second language<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:05">0:30:05-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  to pretty much everyone here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:09</a>:</strong>  It makes for some very interesting communication dynamics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:10">0:30:10-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  Gosh, I'm wonderful that you're there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:14</a>:</strong>  It's making my head swirl.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:15">0:30:15-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  We'll have to talk more after this interview and catch up on your experiences here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:24</a>:</strong>  But hey, so up until now, we've talked a lot about the theories and the concepts behind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:24">0:30:24-0:30:26</a>:</strong>  placemaking and your work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:31</a>:</strong>  Could you talk a little bit about some of the projects that you've helped to facilitate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:31">0:30:31-0:30:36</a>:</strong>  over the years and some which have had unique impacts on their communities through City<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:36">0:30:36-0:30:38</a>:</strong>  Repair, starting with Reedy?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:39">0:30:39-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  I guess I can begin with the places that I inhabit, because that's personal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:55</a>:</strong>  But maybe I'll start off broad and say, yeah, so there are times when I would say people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:31:02</a>:</strong>  have had sad experiences from doing projects or like, you know, burning out or whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:02">0:31:02-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  I don't want to paint this picture that's like, it's all good, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:08</a>:</strong>  It's complex and we're working our ways through it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:08">0:31:08-0:31:12</a>:</strong>  So yeah, I just want to present that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:12">0:31:12-0:31:22</a>:</strong>  And then I've often, so often heard of these incredible stories of just people unfolding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:22">0:31:22-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  and realizing that they have the power to influence, you know, their neighborhood, their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  neighbors, themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:38</a>:</strong>  Like, and it's kind of part of why our work is really hard to measure and evaluate is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:38">0:31:38-0:31:43</a>:</strong>  because it's kind of like how Mark described the birthing of City Repair.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:43">0:31:43-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  You know, it's timeless.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:31:51</a>:</strong>  And you can try to like highlight certain threads, but you're never going to have all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:51">0:31:51-0:31:52</a>:</strong>  of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:31:53">0:31:53-0:32:00</a>:</strong>  And so sometimes I've seen how communities come forward, they do a street painting and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:00">0:32:00-0:32:07</a>:</strong>  then they realize they all share a passion for community resilience and emergency preparedness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:07">0:32:07-0:32:10</a>:</strong>  This is a story from Eugene that I heard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:11">0:32:11-0:32:16</a>:</strong>  Sometimes it's like, you know, people come together and then they realize, oh, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:16">0:32:16-0:32:24</a>:</strong>  this elderly neighbor that we have who doesn't want to ask for help, but could really use<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:24">0:32:24-0:32:29</a>:</strong>  some help from us younger people taking out Blackberry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:29">0:32:29-0:32:35</a>:</strong>  And it's and again, it's like it's not just that the the act of painting the street or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:35">0:32:35-0:32:42</a>:</strong>  a village building convergence project itself is solely responsible, but it does catalyze<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:42">0:32:42-0:32:48</a>:</strong>  a cascading series of like this enmeshing of our relationships.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:48">0:32:48-0:32:48</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:48">0:32:48-0:32:53</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, it might even be as simple as in my old homestead, you know, we'd be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:53">0:32:53-0:32:59</a>:</strong>  out in the garden doing a work party, like orienting volunteers, and then we're just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:32:59">0:32:59-0:33:05</a>:</strong>  out and about in on edges that that we can interact with our neighbors and then they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:05">0:33:05-0:33:09</a>:</strong>  call out to us and we invite them in and then they ask us what we're doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:09">0:33:09-0:33:11</a>:</strong>  And then we're like, well, we're doing this thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:11">0:33:11-0:33:13</a>:</strong>  And then they're like, wow, that sounds cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:13">0:33:13-0:33:20</a>:</strong>  And then so it begins, you know, and it just like reinforces this impulse to be a healing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:20">0:33:20-0:33:24</a>:</strong>  force with the land, collaborating with the land and with each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:25">0:33:25-0:33:30</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, we we painted the street outside my house where I currently live on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:30">0:33:30-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  Sunday, just this last Sunday.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:33:39</a>:</strong>  And I was reminded how I know my neighbors, but I've been I can easily slip into this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:39">0:33:39-0:33:40</a>:</strong>  I'm busy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:40">0:33:40-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  I have all this stuff to do and go to work in, you know, the same things that we that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:51</a>:</strong>  I feel like I'm I'm trying to fight against sometimes as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:33:52</a>:</strong>  And I was like, oh, you know what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:52">0:33:52-0:33:57</a>:</strong>  I'm going to text my neighbor that I that I just saw who brought her kid out to paint<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:33:57">0:33:57-0:34:00</a>:</strong>  the street and ask her whether she likes goat milk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:00">0:34:00-0:34:05</a>:</strong>  I've lived next to her for a whole year and I don't know this because I just wanted to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:05">0:34:05-0:34:12</a>:</strong>  gift her something, you know, and it just it's I feel like this work reminds us of who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:12">0:34:12-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  we are and what's important to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:23</a>:</strong>  And then it creates a mechanism or a container for us to find that deeper connection and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:23">0:34:23-0:34:25</a>:</strong>  then activate around it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:25">0:34:25-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  Even if it might be as simple as like mutual support emotionally, but it could also be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:36</a>:</strong>  like, you know, some really significant activist oriented things like like neighborhood scale<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:36">0:34:36-0:34:43</a>:</strong>  or block scale, solar energy or renewable energy and earthquake preparedness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:43">0:34:43-0:34:44</a>:</strong>  Who knows?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:44">0:34:44-0:34:51</a>:</strong>  Right, like it I just feel like it gives it gives us that opportunity or makes that potential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:52">0:34:52-0:34:53</a>:</strong>  palpable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:53">0:34:53-0:34:55</a>:</strong>  So you feel like, oh, you know what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:55">0:34:55-0:34:56</a>:</strong>  This is possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:34:59</a>:</strong>  So, yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:34:59">0:34:59-0:35:04</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's really once you get started with a project, it takes on a life of its own and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:04">0:35:04-0:35:12</a>:</strong>  it seems like it facilitates connections that grow larger than the initial project or investment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:12">0:35:12-0:35:19</a>:</strong>  and can manifest as different things as they grow, mature or make connections in other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:19">0:35:19-0:35:20</a>:</strong>  ways as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:22">0:35:22-0:35:22</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:23">0:35:23-0:35:24</a>:</strong>  How about you, Mark?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:24">0:35:24-0:35:28</a>:</strong>  What are some of the projects that you've done recently or in the past and how they've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:28">0:35:28-0:35:30</a>:</strong>  impacted the communities in which you've done them?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:31">0:35:31-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  Well, I'm thinking right now of the most recent, like literally the last meeting and then the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:46</a>:</strong>  first one, and I'm also thinking about your question from earlier about sources of inspiration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:49">0:35:49-0:35:54</a>:</strong>  So I want to talk about this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:35:55">0:35:55-0:36:03</a>:</strong>  We've basically been helping to be part of the the movement to create tiny home based<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:04">0:36:04-0:36:07</a>:</strong>  villages by and for homeless people since 1999.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:07">0:36:07-0:36:13</a>:</strong>  So we're really, we are both the old kind of the oldest design activist entity in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:19</a>:</strong>  country, in a sense, or the most senior involved in this from the start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:20">0:36:20-0:36:25</a>:</strong>  We've always been involved and we've been involved in pushing and pushing and pushing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:26">0:36:26-0:36:34</a>:</strong>  the idea that, well, the awareness that people can be healed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:34">0:36:34-0:36:35</a>:</strong>  They can come together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:35">0:36:35-0:36:37</a>:</strong>  They can find new purpose.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:37">0:36:37-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  They can have a restorative effect that so-called broken people, people that are cast away by<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:49</a>:</strong>  our society can find a place and new value in the village.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:36:53</a>:</strong>  And there's so much more to it, though.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:36:53">0:36:53-0:37:01</a>:</strong>  I mean, for me personally, it's it's maybe the leverage point for reintroducing human<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:01">0:37:01-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  scale, car free, utterly participatory environment of self regulation that integrates living<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  and working again, which to me is the antidote to people keep asking, like, is this the answer?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  Is this the answer to everything?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:23</a>:</strong>  In fact, really, I think the Tribune this week, its front page article is focused on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:23">0:37:23-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  our villages and it's asking, is this the answer?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:27">0:37:27-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's that this is the ultimate form of place making where it's not just the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:33</a>:</strong>  bench, it's the whole damn landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:34">0:37:34-0:37:38</a>:</strong>  It's absolutely everything that can be considered from the social organism and how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:38">0:37:38-0:37:44</a>:</strong>  itself regulates through grassroots democracy and how it propels itself through all forms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:44">0:37:44-0:37:46</a>:</strong>  of alternative currency.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:47">0:37:47-0:37:55</a>:</strong>  Not even necessarily needing money anymore to the most the most permacultural expression<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:37:56">0:37:56-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  of everything being in relative location and all these functions, dysfunctions actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:05</a>:</strong>  being stacked to the point where you're actually producing functions out of dysfunction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:07">0:38:07-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and so it's really ground us in the awareness that it's the village that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:13</a>:</strong>  been missing the whole time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:13">0:38:13-0:38:15</a>:</strong>  It's why we even have homelessness at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:16">0:38:16-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  It's why we have crazy rich people thinking that they need more than they can possibly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:20</a>:</strong>  ever spend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:24</a>:</strong>  It's because of this dystopic condition that we're in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:24">0:38:24-0:38:25</a>:</strong>  So that's our newest project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:25">0:38:25-0:38:31</a>:</strong>  Oh, our newest, our newest, that's actually a continuity that goes almost back to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:31">0:38:31-0:38:32</a>:</strong>  beginning as a project type.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:33">0:38:33-0:38:40</a>:</strong>  But the most recent one is a home for a village for veterans, United States veterans in a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:40">0:38:40-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  small town outside of Portland, where the small conservative town, actually the county,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  this very conservative county is doing this work on behalf of the veterans within its<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:38:53</a>:</strong>  boundaries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:38:53">0:38:53-0:39:00</a>:</strong>  And there's supposed to be this antagonism between progressive Portland and rural Clackamas<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:00">0:39:00-0:39:07</a>:</strong>  County, but a bridge has been established at the most radical edges for Portland now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:07">0:39:07-0:39:13</a>:</strong>  to inform how Clackamas County starts to actively take care of their veterans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:13">0:39:13-0:39:19</a>:</strong>  So we're actually designing a village with all these powerful, outstanding, professional<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:19">0:39:19-0:39:24</a>:</strong>  corporate collaborators that are being transformed through their participation in this project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:27</a>:</strong>  So that's an incredible thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:28">0:39:28-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  And why I'm able to make such wild claims is because we're creating a place where the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:37</a>:</strong>  veterans will actually, I mean, as opposed to in their harsh military conditioning programs,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:38">0:39:38-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  that in so many ways resulted in them being betrayed and broken.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:44">0:39:44-0:39:47</a>:</strong>  This will be a place where they live in a more geomorphic way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:47">0:39:47-0:39:51</a>:</strong>  It'll be a landscape that's not, it's not, it won't be like anything that they've known<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:51">0:39:51-0:39:56</a>:</strong>  before, you know, where basically they're just slotted in next to other people's homes,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:56">0:39:56-0:39:59</a>:</strong>  as if everyone is just a product and a worker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:39:59">0:39:59-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  There's going to be a dignity to this landscape, where the buildings are addressing the sun<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  and capturing, you know, passive sunlight and turning it into heat and light inside<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:15</a>:</strong>  of their spaces and then they'll have common spaces, not just for them to enjoy but where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:15">0:40:15-0:40:18</a>:</strong>  they'll have meaningful roles to actually run the village.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:18">0:40:18-0:40:25</a>:</strong>  Everything from making decisions together about every large and small detail to how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:25">0:40:25-0:40:28</a>:</strong>  they will take out the garbage and maintain the landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:28">0:40:28-0:40:36</a>:</strong>  So it'll be their place as they transition back into a life that is, you know, more dignified<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:36">0:40:36-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  for them off of the streets, back to their families or off of the streets and on with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:45</a>:</strong>  their destiny. So that's a current project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:46">0:40:46-0:40:51</a>:</strong>  The very first project though, was, I'm thinking of it right now because of the fact<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:51">0:40:51-0:40:56</a>:</strong>  that you're there down next to the lake, Atatlan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:04</a>:</strong>  We really got started. The final piece of advice that I was going around gathering came<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:04">0:41:04-0:41:10</a>:</strong>  from the Lacandon Maya north of you in Chiapas, and the launch pad for me from there was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:10">0:41:10-0:41:17</a>:</strong>  being in San Pedro for several months and learning and growing, adventuring in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:17">0:41:17-0:41:22</a>:</strong>  landscape and visiting various cooperativas. I'd been in Quetzaltenango for a pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:22">0:41:22-0:41:27</a>:</strong>  good amount of time before I arrived there. But then when I got started too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  Oh really? Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:31</a>:</strong>  Were you doing some language studies there or what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:31">0:41:31-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  Yep, just like everybody. Great. Well, that's, that's the best town.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:44</a>:</strong>  It is the best. Great community there. So, yeah, I ended up with the Lacandon Maya<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:44">0:41:44-0:41:48</a>:</strong>  and I'd been intending to go there for a long time because they're famous for having<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:48">0:41:48-0:41:55</a>:</strong>  never been conquered and distorted by having, you know, being forcibly Catholicism or,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:01</a>:</strong>  you know, forced to live in, in, in colonial grid patterns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:01">0:42:01-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  So, in nonetheless, they've, they've still been impacted since they were recontacted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:10</a>:</strong>  about, I don't know, 95 years ago or something, 85 years ago, maybe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:16</a>:</strong>  So, I guess I'm thinking about you asked earlier about source of inspiration this,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:16">0:42:16-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  this project was informed by an education in urban design and a bit of some mystical<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:31</a>:</strong>  amazingness related to the Lacandon. And then I would say a bit of kind of Jedi<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:31">0:42:31-0:42:36</a>:</strong>  stuff too, which is, which is a bit magical about trusting your feelings and following<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:36">0:42:36-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  your heart. But basically, I mean, the mystical part is when I was there with the Lacandon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:42:48</a>:</strong>  asking what was wrong with me. They described the destruction of my own villages and,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:48">0:42:48-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  you know, the, the idea that my family had basically been conscripted forcibly to become<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:43:00</a>:</strong>  part of this colonizing force and to try to figure out what you can do to stop that was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:00">0:43:00-0:43:05</a>:</strong>  almost a fruitless exercise without finding your own roots and understanding what had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:05">0:43:05-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  happened to your own people so they advised me to learn the story of when my own ancestors<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:18</a>:</strong>  first came into contact with these aggressive regimented structures that are so violently<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:18">0:43:18-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  imposed. And that was very helpful once I got home, but they keep talking about, they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  kept talking about the lines drawn on the landscape, the absence of gathering places<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  in the absence of, you know, cultural dynamism within the landscapes where we live, and you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:40</a>:</strong>  know all this stuff. And when I got home. It was overwhelming. I was deep in contact<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:40">0:43:40-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  shock and actually seriously contemplating killing myself. But fortunately, and this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:51</a>:</strong>  is one of the mystical aspects fortunately they told me exactly what to do when I had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:51">0:43:51-0:43:58</a>:</strong>  come to a moment where I was, I was, I was, I felt, I felt hopeless. So they just said,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:43:58">0:43:58-0:44:04</a>:</strong>  Okay, once you feel that then remember this and think about this. And so right right when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:04">0:44:04-0:44:11</a>:</strong>  I was in deepest despair and feeling absolutely empty. Suddenly I remembered what the advice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:11">0:44:11-0:44:16</a>:</strong>  that I had been given in that moment. And I was filled, I stood up and I looked outside<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:16">0:44:16-0:44:21</a>:</strong>  the window of this garage that I was living in I was unable to even support myself I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:21">0:44:21-0:44:28</a>:</strong>  so upset about coming back to a society of such confusion and violence. But I looked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:28">0:44:28-0:44:34</a>:</strong>  outside the window and I suddenly visualize this thing that would become the first project<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:34">0:44:34-0:44:41</a>:</strong>  that was this catalyst. And basically, you know, the most essential pieces of the human<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:41">0:44:41-0:44:45</a>:</strong>  landscape they're missing in American communities are things like the public square. And then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:45">0:44:45-0:44:53</a>:</strong>  the great meeting house the non dogmatic, you know, non non non theological gathering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:53">0:44:53-0:44:59</a>:</strong>  place, more open ended, multicultural, I mean, multi multi use intergenerational space that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:44:59">0:44:59-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  is as much spiritual as it is just simply functional, a great gathering place. And so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:12</a>:</strong>  I just saw it in front of my eyes. And that was the thing that I just then said about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:12">0:45:12-0:45:18</a>:</strong>  creating that very night and work for months and months until it was done. But the crazy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:18">0:45:18-0:45:24</a>:</strong>  thing is that it was literally described before it was ever met. I mean, before I even visualized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:24">0:45:24-0:45:30</a>:</strong>  it in Portland, it was actually described in the rainforest in Chiapas. And I remember<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:30">0:45:30-0:45:35</a>:</strong>  listening to them talk about this space and I was like, how in the world will that be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:35">0:45:35-0:45:42</a>:</strong>  possible? How in the world will will that be created, and actually debating it. And<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:42">0:45:42-0:45:49</a>:</strong>  they said, basically, just learn who you are. Stand in the middle of a street intersection<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:49">0:45:49-0:45:56</a>:</strong>  and look at the long straight, straight flat lines, know your own story. And then just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:45:56">0:45:56-0:46:04</a>:</strong>  begin to create and become as healthy as possible, because everyone around you will is deeply<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:04">0:46:04-0:46:09</a>:</strong>  interested in becoming healthy again. And so create a space for them to come together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:09">0:46:09-0:46:16</a>:</strong>  So this thing was designed to be like a giant womb that everyone could re-enter together<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:16">0:46:16-0:46:21</a>:</strong>  and then have an experience of, in a sense, rebirthing. But without anyone, without any<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:21">0:46:21-0:46:27</a>:</strong>  program, without any sort of coercion, nobody saying what needed to be done, no chanting,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:27">0:46:27-0:46:33</a>:</strong>  no mantras, just basically an open-ended potluck in a fabulous space that reintegrated people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:33">0:46:33-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  with nature. And then everything in City Repair basically, you know, kind of then accelerated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  from there, I would say. Fantastic. Yeah, that's quite a beautiful vision. Moving on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:46:53</a>:</strong>  to some of your other projects, Riddhi, could you tell me about some of the mobile installations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:53">0:46:53-0:46:59</a>:</strong>  that you've helped to build and where did the inspiration from those come from? Well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:46:59">0:46:59-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  the most recent one that we've been working on is the Tea Crab. And, gosh, again, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:19</a>:</strong>  really hard to pinpoint, but I'll do my best, Oliver. I think what was, what we were, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:19">0:47:19-0:47:25</a>:</strong>  happened was that we were thinking about a bike version that wasn't fossil fuel, as fossil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:25">0:47:25-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  fuel based as regular vehicles. And so then we, as we were having conversations, one of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:45</a>:</strong>  my housemates is a gifted artist. And, you know, I, here's a little side note, it gives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:45">0:47:45-0:47:53</a>:</strong>  me great pleasure to connect artists to collaborate together. Like collaborative art is just so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:47:53">0:47:53-0:48:00</a>:</strong>  utterly beautiful to me. And also it gives me so much joy to connect good men. So that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:00">0:48:00-0:48:07</a>:</strong>  because I feel like, you know, patriarchy, and paternalism doesn't just affect women<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:07">0:48:07-0:48:13</a>:</strong>  or, you know, the feminine aspect, but it really hurts the masculine as well. And so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:13">0:48:13-0:48:19</a>:</strong>  I feel like women tend to gather more easily than men do. So anyway, I was like, I need<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:19">0:48:19-0:48:26</a>:</strong>  to make these people meet and hang out. And so that was part of my evil plan. But anyway,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:26">0:48:26-0:48:34</a>:</strong>  back to the actual, to the Tea Crab. And then I think that part of the inspiration also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:34">0:48:34-0:48:41</a>:</strong>  was we were doing some houseless support during the cold snap that we had this past winter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:41">0:48:41-0:48:47</a>:</strong>  And we, you know, so we're looking at people and how they survive with like eight inches<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:47">0:48:47-0:48:56</a>:</strong>  of snow on the ground. And like, you know, just, we had to trump through some, some difficult<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:48:56">0:48:56-0:49:01</a>:</strong>  terrain, even though it was in the city. And so the inspiration for it being a crab and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:01">0:49:01-0:49:08</a>:</strong>  how it carries its own home on its back, and just like kind of querying and questioning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:08">0:49:08-0:49:17</a>:</strong>  this concept of, do we call, do we need to call a box, a house? Or like, how do, why<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:17">0:49:17-0:49:25</a>:</strong>  do we identify people who don't kind of, you know, conform to our notion of a house? Like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:25">0:49:25-0:49:30</a>:</strong>  why is there so much stigma? And there's just a lot of deep conversations around that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:30">0:49:30-0:49:36</a>:</strong>  that I feel like also fueled the Tea Crab in some ways. And then, of course, it's, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:36">0:49:36-0:49:41</a>:</strong>  like Mark was saying a bit of magic where you're like, okay, and then it also has to be this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:51</a>:</strong>  super inspiring and kind of mystical creature that attracts people. It kind of ruptures the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:49:51">0:49:51-0:50:02</a>:</strong>  mundane by giving people this out of ordinary experience in like any kind of underutilized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:02">0:50:02-0:50:08</a>:</strong>  space or a park or wherever it is that we choose to take it. And so the idea being with this,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:08">0:50:08-0:50:17</a>:</strong>  with this version that we want to get it into most spaces that like are different spaces,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:17">0:50:17-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  perhaps, I don't know, we're still trying to figure out what the programming will look like.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:22">0:50:22-0:50:31</a>:</strong>  But the intention definitely is to delight the inner child in us adults, as well as like actual<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:31">0:50:31-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  children who will act on that delight more easily, perhaps. Yeah. Yeah, and I'm going to leave.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:41">0:50:41-0:50:47</a>:</strong>  That's wonderful. Now, Mark, I remember from the few times that I lived in Portland, Oregon, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:47">0:50:47-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  the Village Building Convergence is quite the annual event. Could you tell my listeners about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:58</a>:</strong>  what the VBC is and how it got started and how it's morphed into the community, natural building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:50:58">0:50:58-0:51:06</a>:</strong>  and permaculture extravaganza that it is today? Well, I would say we continue to learn about what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:06">0:51:06-0:51:15</a>:</strong>  it is that we're doing. I've got an answer for you, but it keeps getting sort of better. Yeah,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:16">0:51:16-0:51:22</a>:</strong>  let's see. So I would say, simply put, that it is the return of the barn raising.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:22">0:51:22-0:51:31</a>:</strong>  And through it, we have through this 17 years now we've been doing this, we have learned that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:31">0:51:31-0:51:36</a>:</strong>  you know, it's not just the public square that's missing. It's not just the social organism that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:37">0:51:37-0:51:45</a>:</strong>  regulates and maintains and programs and inhabits that public square because the square or the,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:45">0:51:45-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  you know, the village heart, it doesn't exist itself. It exists because of and along with,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:52:00</a>:</strong>  and, you know, sustained by the social organism that it's for. But that's, it's an expression<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:00">0:52:00-0:52:09</a>:</strong>  of. So we've always known that from the beginning of our work. But as we've been figuring out ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:09">0:52:09-0:52:14</a>:</strong>  to restore that to, you know, not just Portland, but all these other cities that are now doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:14">0:52:14-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  the village building convergence along with us. We've been learning more about what we couldn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:27</a>:</strong>  see before. Like, you know, you don't just have a public square, that square is there to accommodate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:27">0:52:27-0:52:33</a>:</strong>  all sorts of things that are supposed to be cyclical, annual events. Like imagine you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:33">0:52:33-0:52:38</a>:</strong>  a village where you are meeting your own needs bioregionally. You're undoubtedly going to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:38">0:52:38-0:52:45</a>:</strong>  getting together for all kinds of ways of sharing the abundance and inspiring each other and meeting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:45">0:52:45-0:52:52</a>:</strong>  challenges or crises, but also having sacred experiences together in that space. So one of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:52">0:52:52-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  the greatest ways that we organized, you know, over millennia that human beings have organized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:53:05</a>:</strong>  the ongoing development of their culture has been to come together in celebration and to do work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:05">0:53:05-0:53:10</a>:</strong>  and to do work projects. And the barn raising is one of the ones that we still remember,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:12">0:53:12-0:53:15</a>:</strong>  that used to bring communities together at a certain consistent time of year,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:16">0:53:16-0:53:22</a>:</strong>  in which everyone in the community had a role and played a part. It was a time of cultural fusion,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:23">0:53:23-0:53:29</a>:</strong>  not just to build together over a span of time, but then to celebrate and share food. And at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:29">0:53:29-0:53:35</a>:</strong>  end of it, of course, the great project becomes evident. It's not about the barn at all. The barn<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:35">0:53:35-0:53:40</a>:</strong>  is just a means to bring people together. So they see each other again, and they fall more deeply in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:40">0:53:40-0:53:45</a>:</strong>  love, you know, so that in the warm months that follow the barn raising, more loving happens,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:45">0:53:45-0:53:51</a>:</strong>  and literally children are created and families are more deeply interwoven. So it's a rediscovery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:51">0:53:51-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  I mean, barn raisings become kind of a metaphor for people without realizing at the same time that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:54:03</a>:</strong>  it is actually desperately missing in nearly every American community. There isn't a regular way that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:03">0:54:03-0:54:09</a>:</strong>  people come together. You know, thinking about the fact that Americans move every four to seven<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:09">0:54:09-0:54:15</a>:</strong>  years because there's, the roots don't go down. They uproot themselves and they look for a better<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:15">0:54:15-0:54:20</a>:</strong>  place or they're upwardly mobile only in economic terms. But I can tell you already that the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:20">0:54:20-0:54:26</a>:</strong>  restoration of the barn raising, if it happens in almost any community, people suddenly realize,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:26">0:54:26-0:54:31</a>:</strong>  oh my god, I'm surrounded by the muscle and the talent that powers the whole society. I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:31">0:54:31-0:54:36</a>:</strong>  surrounded by all the friends that I could ever need, that I could ever want, and they stop moving.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:44</a>:</strong>  This is an amazing revelation for us to hold together. Like, oh my god, we keep searching<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:44">0:54:44-0:54:49</a>:</strong>  for that which is already all around us, but we're so isolated and we're so used to thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:49">0:54:49-0:54:54</a>:</strong>  that we don't have power, that we don't reach out to the people around us, to even help each other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:54:54">0:54:54-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  feel more safe. I mean, how reduced have we become to the extent that we don't take an interest in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:07</a>:</strong>  each other's children and say to ourselves, by god, today the streets will become safer, if only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:07">0:55:07-0:55:13</a>:</strong>  for the children of everyone around me. You know, that used to be what got us up in the morning,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:13">0:55:13-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  more than anything else, more than just meeting our own basic needs. So, gosh, I've even forgotten<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:22">0:55:22-0:55:28</a>:</strong>  the question that you asked me. We were just talking about the VBC. Yeah, so the VBC is that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:28">0:55:28-0:55:37</a>:</strong>  but it's so much more than that. I mean, you know, the barn raising is just abstract until you're in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:37">0:55:37-0:55:45</a>:</strong>  it, and then you see that it's a way of actually bringing together, like, all of the inspiration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:45">0:55:45-0:55:51</a>:</strong>  and the inherent diversity of people, so that you see that everyone actually is complementary and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:51">0:55:51-0:55:59</a>:</strong>  bring something very special. You know, just to cut to the current time, the VBC is a way of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:55:59">0:55:59-0:56:07</a>:</strong>  standing in utter contrast to the xenophobia that's been rising, that only can exist without<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:07">0:56:07-0:56:13</a>:</strong>  the barn raising existing. Because, you know, it's easy to polarize and divide people if they don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:13">0:56:13-0:56:17</a>:</strong>  have a basis to bring them together, if they don't realize that they literally stand on common ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:17">0:56:17-0:56:23</a>:</strong>  It's been so easy to manipulate and polarize people simply based on insolvable political<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:23">0:56:23-0:56:29</a>:</strong>  issues, like abortion, for instance, if people don't have a way of understanding that there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:29">0:56:29-0:56:36</a>:</strong>  so much more that they share across that political divide. In fact, I can assure you that I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:36">0:56:36-0:56:42</a>:</strong>  I have never, in all of the hundreds of projects that we've done in Portland, I have never even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:42">0:56:42-0:56:50</a>:</strong>  heard communities digress into these polarizing issues that are just played out endlessly in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:50">0:56:50-0:56:55</a>:</strong>  media. They find so much more, and I can speak right now, especially about my own community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:56:55">0:56:55-0:57:01</a>:</strong>  that's been doing this for 21 years now, I don't even remember a community gathering where people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:01">0:57:01-0:57:07</a>:</strong>  had an argument about how they had differences politically. It's so much more about just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:07">0:57:07-0:57:14</a>:</strong>  excavating the wealth of all of this commonality, sharing the stories of where they live or where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:14">0:57:14-0:57:20</a>:</strong>  they've lived, how they feel about their place now, the new friends that they have, the ideas<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:20">0:57:20-0:57:25</a>:</strong>  that they want to try out, the help that they need or the help that they would offer. I mean,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:25">0:57:25-0:57:30</a>:</strong>  literally it's endless, all the stuff that gets unleashed by doing this stuff that reveals, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:30">0:57:30-0:57:37</a>:</strong>  know, physical and metaphorical common ground. So yeah, the Village Building Convergence is a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:37">0:57:37-0:57:44</a>:</strong>  restorative thing, and it was designed very much coached by the Lak and Don Maya before it even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:44">0:57:44-0:57:51</a>:</strong>  happened as a way of trying to counteract colonialism and restore things, ways of being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:51">0:57:51-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  that have been submerged for such a long time. And that's why it's a phenomenon that is spreading<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:05</a>:</strong>  and taking on endless new forms with, you know, the same kind of core set of principles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  Those are some great points. Riddhi, do you have anything that you would like to add to that, or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:17</a>:</strong>  how would you describe the VBC to anyone who hasn't heard of it before? I would say that it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:17">0:58:17-0:58:27</a>:</strong>  the largest scale empowerment and just like this regenerative, future, healthier future,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:27">0:58:27-0:58:34</a>:</strong>  or however you want to call it, whatever you want to call it, like, it's the largest scale I've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:34">0:58:34-0:58:41</a>:</strong>  witnessed of it happening, and very embedded. Like it's not a convergence where you bring people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:41">0:58:41-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  from all different places and then you kind of share stories like this is people and empowered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:58:56</a>:</strong>  and enacting change in their own communities. And so for me, seeing that there's like, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:58:56">0:58:56-0:59:04</a>:</strong>  we have between 30 to 40 sites every year implementing their projects in Portland alone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:04">0:59:04-0:59:12</a>:</strong>  So to see it at that scale, it's remarkably affirming. You know, I feel like many of us<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:12">0:59:12-0:59:18</a>:</strong>  sometimes when we first start listening to our hearts and doing this work, and at least this was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:18">0:59:18-0:59:24</a>:</strong>  my experience, that you feel alone in it. You feel like you don't fit and, you know, it's almost like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:24">0:59:24-0:59:28</a>:</strong>  there's something wrong with me. I can't like turn it off. I can't turn off my empathy. I can't,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:28">0:59:28-0:59:36</a>:</strong>  you know, whatever, xyz. But I feel like in some ways, City Repair is where all these,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:36">0:59:36-0:59:44</a>:</strong>  all of us misfits kind of come together. We found each other. And then, and we don't,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:44">0:59:44-0:59:50</a>:</strong>  and we all have our different quirks. And like all of these placemakers too, you know, they're not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:50">0:59:50-0:59:57</a>:</strong>  accepting things just as they are. They are an impulse of like making things more wonderful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=0:59:57">0:59:57-1:00:08</a>:</strong>  And so I feel like we found each other and we're finding ways to kind of highlight and bolster each<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:08">1:00:08-1:00:15</a>:</strong>  other's creative and unique spirit, which is just so beautiful. Collaborative leadership to me is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:15">1:00:15-1:00:24</a>:</strong>  just, it's so joyful because I feel like it just is such a regenerative social and cultural pattern<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:24">1:00:24-1:00:30</a>:</strong>  that we need more of. So that's how I would describe it. That's lovely. That's really well said.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:31">1:00:31-1:00:35</a>:</strong>  Now I want to shift gears here just a little bit and really make use of some of your experience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:35">1:00:35-1:00:41</a>:</strong>  and expertise here. Knowing my own Go-Getter audience of this podcast, what advice would you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:41">1:00:41-1:00:46</a>:</strong>  give to my listeners on some of the most effective actions that they could take to facilitate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:46">1:00:46-1:00:51</a>:</strong>  connection and cooperation in their own communities? If you have any specific examples,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:51">1:00:51-1:00:56</a>:</strong>  even better. Go ahead, Reedy. I would say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:00:59">1:00:59-1:01:07</a>:</strong>  first off, maybe be humble. Like, I feel like part of what drew me to this work and keeps me here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:07">1:01:07-1:01:14</a>:</strong>  is just the open-endedness of it, where it's not ever complete because more people arrive. And so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:14">1:01:14-1:01:21</a>:</strong>  there's spaciousness for people to contribute in meaningful and deep ways. So to not have that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:21">1:01:21-1:01:28</a>:</strong>  attachment to things being a certain way, but a commitment to the process of helping each other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:28">1:01:28-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  unfold. And I feel like I would say for me, that has been humility over and over again. And also,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:38">1:01:38-1:01:46</a>:</strong>  just really, really trying to uphold pluralism. I've noticed that when I get triggered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:46">1:01:46-1:01:52</a>:</strong>  or when I'm overwhelmed, I find it hard to hear another perspective that's different from my own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:52">1:01:52-1:01:59</a>:</strong>  But ideally, we would be inclusive and taking into consideration diversity of opinions and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:01:59">1:01:59-1:02:08</a>:</strong>  perspectives. So pluralism. And then taking away our fear of failure. So really embracing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:08">1:02:08-1:02:15</a>:</strong>  and celebrating failure because we are definitely going to fail. I guarantee you, you will fail.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:15">1:02:15-1:02:22</a>:</strong>  And that's part of it. It's a learning journey. So really looking at it as a learning journey. And<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:23">1:02:23-1:02:30</a>:</strong>  then perhaps the last thing I'll say is being gentle and trusting and forgiving of oneself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:31">1:02:31-1:02:43</a>:</strong>  I bring a lot of my own grief into this. Whether it's like my colonial effects on my ancestry,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:43">1:02:43-1:02:50</a>:</strong>  my own ancestry. I feel like humanity, we're very complex. We're both capable of amazing things and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:50">1:02:50-1:02:59</a>:</strong>  also really horrific things. And so while I feel like the BBC and City Repel, we really highlight<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:02:59">1:02:59-1:03:09</a>:</strong>  and catalyze the positive tendencies that humanity has. I feel like holding space for our grief so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:09">1:03:09-1:03:16</a>:</strong>  that we can transmute it into this beauty is equally important. So when we do find like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:16">1:03:16-1:03:23</a>:</strong>  in ourselves things that are hard or in others, like to be compassionate and especially with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:23">1:03:23-1:03:30</a>:</strong>  ourselves as activists, I really want to emphasize that because I see an activist culture where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:30">1:03:30-1:03:37</a>:</strong>  often really hard on ourselves and then that ripples out into burnout culture and other toxic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:37">1:03:37-1:03:43</a>:</strong>  patterns. So yeah. Yeah, that's really valuable advice. I think I'm actually going to have to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:43">1:03:43-1:03:51</a>:</strong>  implement some of that myself. Mark, same question to you. Okay. Well, let's see. I will just pass on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:51">1:03:51-1:03:59</a>:</strong>  some Mayan advice, which is this. The revolution you seek needs to be one where you can start<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:03:59">1:03:59-1:04:10</a>:</strong>  right now with whatever you have and whoever is with you. So that's it. But what does that mean?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:11">1:04:11-1:04:19</a>:</strong>  It leads to a lot of things. You challenge colonialism, which tells you that you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:19">1:04:19-1:04:25</a>:</strong>  no power, that you can only vote or write a check to a cause or write a letter to your congressman<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:25">1:04:25-1:04:29</a>:</strong>  and hope that somebody else will care enough to do something and someone else will have enough<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:30">1:04:30-1:04:38</a>:</strong>  of a budget to pay someone else to act on your behalf. All of that is bullshit. It is bullshit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:38">1:04:38-1:04:44</a>:</strong>  Although I would say do what you can. Voting is not bullshit in the sense that people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:44">1:04:44-1:04:49</a>:</strong>  have fought against this paradigm in order to ensure that people have rights and access<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:49">1:04:49-1:04:56</a>:</strong>  in that realm. People died to vote. So that's not bullshit. But it's bullshit to say that that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:04:56">1:04:56-1:05:04</a>:</strong>  your only spectrum for action. It's bullshit that other people define the issues for you that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:04">1:05:04-1:05:11</a>:</strong>  vote on without necessarily asking you what you really want to vote on. That's bullshit. But<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:11">1:05:11-1:05:17</a>:</strong>  giving voice in every single way that you can is important. And I think that's what I would say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:17">1:05:17-1:05:25</a>:</strong>  Giving voice in every single way that you can is important. So writing a check to support causes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:25">1:05:25-1:05:32</a>:</strong>  and organizations, that's important. Being an advocate in any way that you can that you're given<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:32">1:05:32-1:05:38</a>:</strong>  in this construct, that's all important. But it's even more important, like thinking about that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:38">1:05:38-1:05:44</a>:</strong>  advice to act where you are right now with whoever you have and whatever you have, is basically trying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:44">1:05:44-1:05:49</a>:</strong>  to the idea that we actually have our power. We stand in it right now. That it's absurd to say<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:49">1:05:49-1:05:55</a>:</strong>  that anyone else can possibly have your power is a trick. It's a trick. It's a strange kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:05:57">1:05:57-1:06:03</a>:</strong>  structure that we carry around with ourselves, like a box on our head that prevents us from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:03">1:06:03-1:06:10</a>:</strong>  seeing the beauty of the world and feeling our true strength to speak. Freaking we have thumbs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:10">1:06:10-1:06:17</a>:</strong>  and ears. We have a voice, like we can sing. There's actually limitless ways that we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:17">1:06:17-1:06:23</a>:</strong>  affect the world with the spectrum of our senses and our embodiment to actually go forth and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:23">1:06:23-1:06:30</a>:</strong>  immediately change the world. So what does that mean in practical terms? I mean, for myself,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:30">1:06:30-1:06:37</a>:</strong>  I walked into an intersection. I looked around. I'd been coached to realize that standing in an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:37">1:06:37-1:06:41</a>:</strong>  intersection in the colonial grid, you're standing where the village was supposed to begin. Because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:41">1:06:41-1:06:46</a>:</strong>  intersections are where the pathways of our lives come together. That's where we should be creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:46">1:06:46-1:06:51</a>:</strong>  culture. We should be interacting with each other in that space. It should not be nullified and just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:51">1:06:51-1:06:57</a>:</strong>  reduced to a traffic corridor. In terms of the lineage of our thousands and thousands of years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:06:57">1:06:57-1:07:02</a>:</strong>  together, that was always a place where our lives converged. And in fact, in urban design and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:02">1:07:02-1:07:09</a>:</strong>  planning, the first move to design a village is to find that point where your lives come together in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:09">1:07:09-1:07:14</a>:</strong>  an intersection and enhance that through placemaking so that it actually serves its primordial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:14">1:07:14-1:07:21</a>:</strong>  function to bring people together. But first, to do that, you have to reclaim your power. You have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:21">1:07:21-1:07:28</a>:</strong>  to take the box off of your head, the leash off of your neck, the collar, and then unleash yourself,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:28">1:07:28-1:07:36</a>:</strong>  free yourself, and say to yourself, I indeed have my power. And my life purpose now will flower as I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:36">1:07:36-1:07:43</a>:</strong>  go forth seeking the liberation of everyone else around me. And like Riddhi said, you're going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:43">1:07:43-1:07:48</a>:</strong>  have plenty of chances to make mistakes. And instead of fearing those, like instead of numbing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:48">1:07:48-1:07:55</a>:</strong>  yourself or silencing your voice for fear of failure, run toward those points of learning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:07:55">1:07:55-1:08:02</a>:</strong>  Like, no, that's not even digression. It's not even a bump in the road. Every time you courageously<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:02">1:08:02-1:08:09</a>:</strong>  go into the unknown and you encounter situations that are beyond your experience, you just jump<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:09">1:08:09-1:08:15</a>:</strong>  into that because it's your chance to grow to a whole new level of power. So these so-called<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:15">1:08:15-1:08:20</a>:</strong>  mistakes are actually learning opportunities. And once you start to see that, you can coach that in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:20">1:08:20-1:08:28</a>:</strong>  other people, like, yes, embrace that opportunity and turn it into, you know, turn it into the flip<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:28">1:08:28-1:08:34</a>:</strong>  side of everything that you've experienced. Like everything you've experienced that's dystopic on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:34">1:08:34-1:08:41</a>:</strong>  the flip side of it is the grand glorious gleaming like missed opportunity that could always have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:41">1:08:41-1:08:46</a>:</strong>  happened instead. And now it's your time. It's a whole new chapter in your life to actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:46">1:08:46-1:08:54</a>:</strong>  write that dystopic wrong. So reclaim your own power and start wherever you are. You know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:54">1:08:54-1:08:59</a>:</strong>  literally, even if you're like, oh my God, but yeah, this is a mundane parking lot. No,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:08:59">1:08:59-1:09:05</a>:</strong>  the opportunity is right there in the mundane to transform it into something you might think of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:05">1:09:05-1:09:09</a>:</strong>  as being more miraculous. There's another thing though, to really help with that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:10">1:09:10-1:09:15</a>:</strong>  make it part of your own healing process to dream on other people's behalf,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:15">1:09:15-1:09:21</a>:</strong>  to like seek their fulfillment, their emergence, their liberation through your own creative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:22">1:09:22-1:09:29</a>:</strong>  initiative. Like it's important to at some point realize our self obsession and self absorption to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:29">1:09:29-1:09:36</a>:</strong>  the extent that we accumulate so much, or that we only think about our own hide day in and day out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:36">1:09:36-1:09:41</a>:</strong>  is actually a symptom of living within the compartmentalization of colonialism. It's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:41">1:09:41-1:09:47</a>:</strong>  actually made you self-obsessed, you know, that kind of thing. So you break out of that and you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:47">1:09:47-1:09:52</a>:</strong>  become a larger, stronger self by actually caring about other people, dwelling on them. Like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:53">1:09:53-1:09:57</a>:</strong>  what are they doing today? What are their dreams and aspirations? How can you connect to that? And<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:09:57">1:09:57-1:10:02</a>:</strong>  of course, what you get in return is a form of friendship that is more sincere and real and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:02">1:10:02-1:10:07</a>:</strong>  grounded than you ever knew before, even with people that you thought you could never care<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:07">1:10:07-1:10:12</a>:</strong>  about. And all of this grows your soul. It creates more surface area for your feeling and for your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:12">1:10:12-1:10:18</a>:</strong>  for your learning. So, you know, that's all very much about personal transformation. But, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:19">1:10:19-1:10:26</a>:</strong>  I think it was like what Michael Stone was saying in one of his presentations just shortly before<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:26">1:10:26-1:10:37</a>:</strong>  he died, that the more you become enlightened, I guess, the more you become also disturbed by the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:37">1:10:37-1:10:43</a>:</strong>  state of what everyone else is going through. And it compels you to become a more creative agent in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:44">1:10:44-1:10:51</a>:</strong>  everyone's life. So it just doesn't stop. And then that just keeps growing you. So, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:51">1:10:51-1:10:57</a>:</strong>  so, you know, I guess I would also advise people, like, in a way, keep doing your spiritual practice,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:10:57">1:10:57-1:11:03</a>:</strong>  but also become more interested in a larger scale of self. I don't think you're going to find what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:03">1:11:03-1:11:08</a>:</strong>  you're looking for exclusively through yoga and meditation. You're going to find more of what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:08">1:11:08-1:11:14</a>:</strong>  you're looking for, probably through more surface area, more contact with the real lives and needs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:14">1:11:14-1:11:21</a>:</strong>  of the people around you. And then it'll embed these lessons in your daily way of living. That's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:21">1:11:21-1:11:28</a>:</strong>  what I would say. I'm very glad you said that. I agree with that profoundly. Now, I know from my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:28">1:11:28-1:11:33</a>:</strong>  own experience that the right considerations in planning make a world of difference in how a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:33">1:11:33-1:11:39</a>:</strong>  project turns out. And this is any type of project. Could you both give some advice on some essential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:39">1:11:39-1:11:45</a>:</strong>  factors or elements in community revitalization projects that people often overlook or forget?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:46">1:11:46-1:11:54</a>:</strong>  Well, certainly it would be, you know, those of us that are trained in the culture of design and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:11:54">1:11:54-1:12:00</a>:</strong>  development in architecture and planning or in construction and finance have been trained to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:00">1:12:00-1:12:06</a>:</strong>  more about the actual project and not so much about the community and not so much about the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:06">1:12:06-1:12:14</a>:</strong>  people who will actually inhabit the project. So I think the most overlooked aspect is to make a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:14">1:12:14-1:12:22</a>:</strong>  stronger link between the potential occupants of the place and think of like, you know, low income<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:22">1:12:22-1:12:27</a>:</strong>  housing, for instance. If you're only thinking of it as housing and not as a village, then all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:27">1:12:27-1:12:33</a>:</strong>  you're going to do is house people. I think even for selfish reasons, a developer should care like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:33">1:12:33-1:12:37</a>:</strong>  gosh, don't you want to leave a legacy in the world? Aren't you tired of waking up every day,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:38">1:12:38-1:12:43</a>:</strong>  you know, having sending your kids out into the streets of a world that only gets worse every day?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:43">1:12:43-1:12:47</a>:</strong>  Like what kind of legacy are you going to leave after all this damn work that you've done with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:47">1:12:47-1:12:52</a>:</strong>  your life? Couldn't you build more? You can use the same material, same amount of material and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:52">1:12:52-1:12:57</a>:</strong>  the same cost and create more. Doesn't that matter? So I think overlooking the community,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:12:57">1:12:57-1:13:05</a>:</strong>  overlooking humanity is probably the biggest omission of projects. So yeah, try to root what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:05">1:13:05-1:13:10</a>:</strong>  you do in real community. And then in terms of sustainability, there's so many different ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:10">1:13:10-1:13:18</a>:</strong>  to think about sustainability beyond financial models that also connect back to community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:19">1:13:19-1:13:26</a>:</strong>  You know, how, because, you know, you can install like a more energy efficient heating and cooling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:26">1:13:26-1:13:34</a>:</strong>  system in your project. But if the community is just reduced to pushing buttons and not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:34">1:13:34-1:13:38</a>:</strong>  actually interacting with their environment, then you haven't really created a sustainable culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:38">1:13:38-1:13:44</a>:</strong>  You've only, you know, you've only created a building that's more energy efficient, but it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:44">1:13:44-1:13:50</a>:</strong>  won't even necessarily be inhabited that way if people can't relate to it. So again, it comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:50">1:13:50-1:13:58</a>:</strong>  back to the community. Fantastic. All right. Same question to you, Riddhi. I'm going to draw on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:13:59">1:13:59-1:14:07</a>:</strong>  an approach that I learned from Judy Bluehorse, who's a mentor of mine. He's a local native<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:08">1:14:08-1:14:16</a>:</strong>  herbalist and a sorceress is the way I want to describe her. But Judy, when she's working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:16">1:14:16-1:14:24</a>:</strong>  with land, installing native gardens, she has his way of really taking some time to observe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:24">1:14:24-1:14:32</a>:</strong>  who is there and seeing, perceiving the land, not so much from her own frame of reference,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:32">1:14:32-1:14:42</a>:</strong>  you know, oh, I want this to be like this here and what is often our own goals and expectations,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:42">1:14:42-1:14:47</a>:</strong>  color, the way that we look and perceive everything. Right. And so there might be ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:47">1:14:47-1:14:53</a>:</strong>  that community is gathering that we haven't, we don't relate to, so we don't recognize. So<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:53">1:14:53-1:14:58</a>:</strong>  I would say, you know, just taking some time when there's revitalization project, like who is there,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:14:59">1:14:59-1:15:07</a>:</strong>  who's revitalized, like, you know, ask questions of that, that kind of, I would say, question some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:07">1:15:07-1:15:15</a>:</strong>  presumptions that we may be starting off with. And then another thing that you just, so then, okay,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:15">1:15:15-1:15:21</a>:</strong>  so for example, then there might be lawn and dandelions and things like that. And in permaculture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:21">1:15:21-1:15:27</a>:</strong>  we say like, okay, we first observe and then we recognize that even though the dandelions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:27">1:15:27-1:15:34</a>:</strong>  and other like, quote unquote, weeds are present, that actually they are doing beneficial things to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:34">1:15:34-1:15:42</a>:</strong>  the soil. So identifying ways that things that we may not like or want might actually be serving<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:42">1:15:42-1:15:49</a>:</strong>  really core functions there and hold them together. And then when you want to change it,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:49">1:15:49-1:15:54</a>:</strong>  because you're like, okay, well, it's mostly dandelions. And I do want to put a native garden<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:15:54">1:15:54-1:16:01</a>:</strong>  here. And you know, it's been gone through, like, it's the goal, not just of you, perhaps, but like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:01">1:16:01-1:16:07</a>:</strong>  a number of you have expressed that desire, then going about it in a way that doesn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:08">1:16:08-1:16:16</a>:</strong>  disregard or dishonor the, some of the key aspects of that place. So maybe there's ways to sheet<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:16">1:16:16-1:16:24</a>:</strong>  mulch or turn the soil and plant that doesn't completely like, destroy the weeds that were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:24">1:16:24-1:16:34</a>:</strong>  present, because many of them are medicinal. Most times, I prefer to move into a project<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:34">1:16:34-1:16:42</a>:</strong>  with a fair amount of time. But also, not to kind of understate that excitement of like, whoa,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:42">1:16:42-1:16:49</a>:</strong>  and then we just like blitzed this garden. And now it's got beautiful huckleberries and other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:49">1:16:49-1:16:55</a>:</strong>  gorgeous native plants. Like there is that potential for transformation, but I feel like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:16:55">1:16:55-1:17:02</a>:</strong>  it has to be grounded in deep listening to the inhabitants, the existing inhabitants and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:02">1:17:02-1:17:03</a>:</strong>  future users.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:04">1:17:04-1:17:10</a>:</strong>  Absolutely. Yeah, that's a very good point. Now, just before we wrap up here, I know that there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:10">1:17:10-1:17:15</a>:</strong>  are lots of opportunities for volunteers to get involved. And there are a ton of events in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:15">1:17:15-1:17:20</a>:</strong>  especially the months ahead. Riddhi, could you give me a rundown of the ways that people can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:20">1:17:20-1:17:21</a>:</strong>  get involved with City Repair?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:22">1:17:22-1:17:32</a>:</strong>  Well, multiple ways. One I would say is if you a little bit of help in starting something similar,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:32">1:17:32-1:17:40</a>:</strong>  wherever you're at, get in touch with us. Info at cityrepair.org. We check that fairly often.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:40">1:17:40-1:17:49</a>:</strong>  And so we will respond to that as best as we can. And then if you are wanting to come visit us and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:49">1:17:49-1:17:57</a>:</strong>  embed yourself into the social culture, we're part of here. Email us either info at City Repair or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:17:57">1:17:57-1:18:05</a>:</strong>  volunteer at cityrepair.org. We do internships, we can do that for credit, like whatever works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:05">1:18:05-1:18:12</a>:</strong>  We're very collaborative in the way that we co-facilitate our collective emergence. Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:12">1:18:12-1:18:17</a>:</strong>  So that applies to volunteer opportunities as well. We might give you some guidelines like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:17">1:18:17-1:18:24</a>:</strong>  oh, we could use help with budget or whatever, but we're definitely looking to learn from you and to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:24">1:18:24-1:18:32</a>:</strong>  help you thrive in whatever ways you want. And then right now, seasonally, we are in budget<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:32">1:18:32-1:18:37</a>:</strong>  season. That's why I mentioned it. But we're going, we still have some events because it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:37">1:18:37-1:18:44</a>:</strong>  the summer and we're celebrating and spending time in the woods and things like that. And then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:44">1:18:44-1:18:51</a>:</strong>  in the fall, we will launch our new season for Village Building Convergence 2018. We'll be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:18:51">1:18:51-1:19:00</a>:</strong>  calling in proposals for community projects. So you can participate that way. We'll also be calling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:00">1:19:00-1:19:07</a>:</strong>  on folks to help us get the village up and running, which is, you know, it's a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:07">1:19:07-1:19:13</a>:</strong>  interesting things like children's activities, healing, sponsorships, like all the back end,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:13">1:19:13-1:19:22</a>:</strong>  you can imagine of organizing an event of this scale. And we also have a robust organizing wing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:22">1:19:22-1:19:32</a>:</strong>  or in like connection to the houseless organizing and advocacy. So that's something we do your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:32">1:19:32-1:19:38</a>:</strong>  round. And we're very deeply immersed in like Mark mentioned earlier. So there's tons of stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:38">1:19:38-1:19:46</a>:</strong>  that we are implicated in currently. And we're also always open to exploring new potential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:46">1:19:46-1:19:54</a>:</strong>  horizons with what you bring in. So just get in touch. Fantastic. Thank you. And Mark, do you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:19:54">1:19:54-1:20:01</a>:</strong>  anything that you'd like to add to that? Let's see. I think well, really is has been for the last,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:01">1:20:01-1:20:09</a>:</strong>  I think three years now, really the main placemaking coordinator and co executive director<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:09">1:20:09-1:20:16</a>:</strong>  of city repairs. So I think she has a better sense of, of the things that are currently going on than<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:16">1:20:16-1:20:24</a>:</strong>  I do, especially because my wife and I have just had a little baby girl. So I'm not quite as in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:24">1:20:24-1:20:30</a>:</strong>  touch with all that we have going on. But I would I would say that, you know, the culture of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:30">1:20:30-1:20:40</a>:</strong>  activism that we represent is very open ended. And I think that it's still true that I mean,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:40">1:20:40-1:20:45</a>:</strong>  just as really said, we're very interested in being affected by the people that come into doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:46">1:20:46-1:20:52</a>:</strong>  So for for people who want to come in and learn, they can easily come do that. There's people who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:53">1:20:53-1:20:58</a>:</strong>  would love to work with them. But the thing is that this is all propelled by friendship.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:20:58">1:20:58-1:21:05</a>:</strong>  So, you know, if if you're if you're a person that is looking to, you know, to become more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:05">1:21:05-1:21:11</a>:</strong>  skilled and experience and perhaps, you know, more equipped in some future job capacity,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:11">1:21:11-1:21:16</a>:</strong>  that's all fine. That's definitely part of what we're interested in too. But part of the terms of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:16">1:21:16-1:21:26</a>:</strong>  placemaking and also decolonization is that we elevate once again, the highest value of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:26">1:21:26-1:21:33</a>:</strong>  indigenous people of this land, which is and this is a way of reclaiming and not just on behalf of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:33">1:21:33-1:21:37</a>:</strong>  the native people of this land, but your own native self, that friendship becomes the highest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:37">1:21:37-1:21:44</a>:</strong>  value and the most sacred word. So, you know, rather than like rather than for us to say,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:44">1:21:44-1:21:48</a>:</strong>  oh, we're a nonprofit 501 C three, we have a board of directors and this is how we operate,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:48">1:21:48-1:21:54</a>:</strong>  we use consensus model or whatever it is that we that we've done. So, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:54">1:21:54-1:21:59</a>:</strong>  we've also got going on. That is not none of that is more important than the fact that we are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:21:59">1:21:59-1:22:05</a>:</strong>  propelled and guided by the desire to to make friends and be genuine with each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:06">1:22:06-1:22:12</a>:</strong>  So it's very healthy culture. And when people arrive and and and want to get involved,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:12">1:22:12-1:22:16</a>:</strong>  they can surely step right in, especially to whatever's going on in the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:17">1:22:17-1:22:21</a>:</strong>  But if they have an idea, a world changing idea, whether it's to address climate change or to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:21">1:22:21-1:22:27</a>:</strong>  involve, you know, youth in a more effective way. We're all about it, we want to know what people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:27">1:22:27-1:22:34</a>:</strong>  are carrying and new new projects can be birthed here. And this is an excellent foundation for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:34">1:22:34-1:22:39</a>:</strong>  people to try out things. So, you know, when we talk about city repair, we know full well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:40">1:22:40-1:22:44</a>:</strong>  that we haven't repaired the city and we still don't quite know how to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:44">1:22:44-1:22:48</a>:</strong>  It's going to take the entire city to do it. And once we're there, we'll have repaired it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:48">1:22:48-1:22:53</a>:</strong>  So it's a it's a grand goal and ambition and we need everyone's help. Even our, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:53">1:22:53-1:22:58</a>:</strong>  so-called adversaries eventually will realize that we're all on the same side. And that's what we mean<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:22:59">1:22:59-1:23:05</a>:</strong>  by the repaired city. Excellent. Well, I want to thank both of you for a very insightful, very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:05">1:23:05-1:23:11</a>:</strong>  thoughtful interview. And you've been very generous with your time. I've gotten a ton of value from it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:11">1:23:11-1:23:16</a>:</strong>  And I hope maybe we can follow up and learn a little bit about how your projects can be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:16">1:23:16-1:23:22</a>:</strong>  continued to evolve and include more and more voices in the future. We've got a great team,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:22">1:23:22-1:23:31</a>:</strong>  Oliver. It certainly sounds like it. Yeah. Well, thank you for having us. Yeah. It's been my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:31">1:23:31-1:23:37</a>:</strong>  pleasure. Thanks, Oliver. Have a great day. Thank you too, Mark. Take care, you guys. You too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:39">1:23:39-1:23:43</a>:</strong>  So before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming months.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:43">1:23:43-1:23:48</a>:</strong>  And I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad Goodsy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:48">1:23:48-1:23:53</a>:</strong>  Hey, buddy, what's new? Oh, man, so much is happening. First off, though, I just want to say<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:53">1:23:53-1:23:58</a>:</strong>  thanks for having me, man. I really love your podcast. And I actually had a great time doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:23:58">1:23:58-1:24:04</a>:</strong>  that interview back in one of the earlier episodes. Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:04">1:24:04-1:24:09</a>:</strong>  collaboration between Atitlan Organics and Abundant Edge. As you know, we've been offering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:09">1:24:09-1:24:14</a>:</strong>  permaculture design courses for over six years now, and they really have become a staple here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:14">1:24:14-1:24:20</a>:</strong>  in Lake Atitlan. In particular, though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:20">1:24:20-1:24:26</a>:</strong>  travelers, gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:26">1:24:26-1:24:33</a>:</strong>  of permaculture design. Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:33">1:24:33-1:24:39</a>:</strong>  way afterward. It's life changing. But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:39">1:24:39-1:24:44</a>:</strong>  thanks to our collaboration, we're going to be able to offer your natural building course<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:44">1:24:44-1:24:50</a>:</strong>  immediately after every one of our intro to permaculture courses. Literally, this two-week<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:50">1:24:50-1:24:56</a>:</strong>  offering is like possibly the most complete package that I know of available anywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:24:56">1:24:56-1:25:01</a>:</strong>  Basically, with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything they need to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:01">1:25:01-1:25:07</a>:</strong>  start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle. That's what I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:07">1:25:07-1:25:12</a>:</strong>  excited about, man. But yeah, what about you? What's going on? Man, well, you know already that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:12">1:25:12-1:25:17</a>:</strong>  me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big season as well. I mean, starting in November,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:17">1:25:17-1:25:22</a>:</strong>  we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration site, which is, of course,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:22">1:25:22-1:25:27</a>:</strong>  right down the hill from your farm. We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:27">1:25:27-1:25:32</a>:</strong>  kitchens, and lounge areas connected to houses, and it's all going to be made out of natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:32">1:25:32-1:25:37</a>:</strong>  materials. I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:37">1:25:37-1:25:42</a>:</strong>  farming methods for years and years to come. And we'll even be offering courses and internship<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:42">1:25:42-1:25:46</a>:</strong>  opportunities to people who want to learn for themselves about how to build with natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:46">1:25:46-1:25:52</a>:</strong>  materials and set up their own farms. Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man. And honestly,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:52">1:25:52-1:25:57</a>:</strong>  this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things too. I mean, this little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:25:57">1:25:57-1:26:02</a>:</strong>  town is Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala, like right here on the shores of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:02">1:26:02-1:26:06</a>:</strong>  Lake Atitlan. It's one of the most beautiful places in the world. And on top of that, you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:06">1:26:06-1:26:12</a>:</strong>  this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich and alive. And probably my favorite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:12">1:26:12-1:26:18</a>:</strong>  part is that we have this world international community of alternative people that are open to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:18">1:26:18-1:26:23</a>:</strong>  new ideas and really putting things into practice. I mean, within walking distance of the bamboo<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:23">1:26:23-1:26:28</a>:</strong>  guest house, you've got loads of things going on. We got the projects that we've already talked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:28">1:26:28-1:26:33</a>:</strong>  about, but you also have yoga retreat centers. You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:33">1:26:33-1:26:39</a>:</strong>  school. You have Love Probiotics. You have Fungi Academy. And honestly, loads more alternative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:39">1:26:39-1:26:44</a>:</strong>  blow your mind type stuff. I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:44">1:26:44-1:26:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it really does. And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:48">1:26:48-1:26:52</a>:</strong>  but we've got to make sure that they've got the skills first. So what do you say? Let's offer a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:52">1:26:52-1:26:57</a>:</strong>  big discount to those who sign up for both courses. I mean, all food and lodging and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:26:57">1:26:57-1:27:02</a>:</strong>  amazing bamboo guest house is already included in the tuition. So this will be like the best deal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:02">1:27:02-1:27:07</a>:</strong>  that we've ever offered. That's a great idea. Because I mean, people can still take just one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:07">1:27:07-1:27:11</a>:</strong>  course if that's what they're into, or if they can't make the full two weeks. But this will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:11">1:27:11-1:27:16</a>:</strong>  actually make the two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people. That way more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:16">1:27:16-1:27:21</a>:</strong>  people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they want to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:21">1:27:21-1:27:26</a>:</strong>  So hey, to all of you listening out there, we really want passionate and driven people like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-city-repair/#t=1:27:26">1:27:26-1:27:30</a>:</strong>  you to come and be a part of the community and the ecosystem that we're building out here.<br />
