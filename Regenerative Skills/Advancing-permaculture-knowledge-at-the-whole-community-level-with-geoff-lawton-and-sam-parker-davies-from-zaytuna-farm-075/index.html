<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:14">0:03:14-0:03:17</a>:</strong>  Jeff and I also talk about his experience and memories from working in our region of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:17">0:03:17-0:03:23</a>:</strong>  Guatemala many years ago with our friends at IMAP, the Mesoamerican Institute of Permaculture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:23">0:03:23-0:03:28</a>:</strong>  and gives great advice on gathering information and observing a site in depth before making<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:28">0:03:28-0:03:29</a>:</strong>  assumptions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:29">0:03:29-0:03:33</a>:</strong>  This is a great and nuanced discussion from both ends of the spectrum and I'm sure anyone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:33">0:03:33-0:03:36</a>:</strong>  out there can relate to it on some level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:36">0:03:36-0:03:40</a>:</strong>  So from here, I'll turn things over to Jeff and Sam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:40">0:03:40-0:03:44</a>:</strong>  So I'm joined today with Jeff Lawton and Sam Parker-Davies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:44">0:03:44-0:03:45</a>:</strong>  How are you guys doing today?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:45">0:03:45-0:03:46</a>:</strong>  Good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:46">0:03:46-0:03:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah, good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:47">0:03:47-0:03:48</a>:</strong>  Thanks Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:48">0:03:48-0:03:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah, thanks so much for being with us today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:49">0:03:49-0:03:52</a>:</strong>  Now I've got tons of questions for the both of you, but before we get started, could each<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:52">0:03:52-0:03:58</a>:</strong>  of you introduce yourselves a little bit and tell us how you got first into permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:03:58">0:03:58-0:04:01</a>:</strong>  because I know your journeys are at very different points right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:03</a>:</strong>  So starting with Sam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:03">0:04:03-0:04:04</a>:</strong>  Go ahead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:07</a>:</strong>  So my name is Sam Parker-Davies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:14</a>:</strong>  I was born in the Blue Mountains of Australia and ever since I was little, I wanted to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:14">0:04:14-0:04:15</a>:</strong>  an environmental scientist.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:15">0:04:15-0:04:19</a>:</strong>  So it's something that's been with me for a long, long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:19">0:04:19-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  My grandmother did permaculture, but it was something that kind of came and blips on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:24">0:04:24-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  radar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:31</a>:</strong>  I remember in year eight watching this video that gave me so much hope in a depressed state.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:31">0:04:31-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  I was really down and a geography teacher showed us this video about this man greening<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:41</a>:</strong>  the desert somewhere in Jordan and wanting to go to the Middle East from a very young<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:41">0:04:41-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  age.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:48</a>:</strong>  It kind of like sparked so much life and hope and heart inside of me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:48">0:04:48-0:04:56</a>:</strong>  From there, I went forward and I was very active, very passionate about creating change<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:04:56">0:04:56-0:05:00</a>:</strong>  and permaculture completely left my mind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:00">0:05:00-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  I didn't realize anything I was doing had anything to do with that until when I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  18, I ran for council and a permaculture teacher in my town took me aside and told me about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:16</a>:</strong>  permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:16">0:05:16-0:05:22</a>:</strong>  She's very much about the revolutionary side of social permaculture, about how we can create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:22">0:05:22-0:05:28</a>:</strong>  different social structures to change the world, which was what my campaign was about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:28">0:05:28-0:05:34</a>:</strong>  was about how we can create empowered community to change the living structures in the local<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:34">0:05:34-0:05:35</a>:</strong>  situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:35">0:05:35-0:05:42</a>:</strong>  So she educated me in permaculture and completely opened my whole world to this connected mass<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:42">0:05:42-0:05:47</a>:</strong>  of people doing incredible things for the planet, completely changing our trajectory<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:47">0:05:47-0:05:52</a>:</strong>  and paving a way forward that gives me so much life, so much hope and fuels my ambition<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:52">0:05:52-0:05:57</a>:</strong>  to do all the work that I can to aid this amazing cause.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:05:57">0:05:57-0:06:02</a>:</strong>  Now I'm living with Jeff after trying to support and sustain myself in the Blue Mountains<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:02">0:06:02-0:06:11</a>:</strong>  off running workshops for kids and adults in my little tent in my backyard so that I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:11">0:06:11-0:06:15</a>:</strong>  didn't have to pay rent and so I can make whatever income I could.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:15">0:06:15-0:06:21</a>:</strong>  And so now I'm here seeking a wider education so that I can do the most good I can in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:21">0:06:21-0:06:22</a>:</strong>  world going forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:22">0:06:22-0:06:23</a>:</strong>  Marvelous!<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:23">0:06:23-0:06:25</a>:</strong>  That's a really quick trajectory in a short time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:25">0:06:25-0:06:27</a>:</strong>  Now Jeff, tell us about your background.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:27">0:06:27-0:06:31</a>:</strong>  Well, I was born in England.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:31">0:06:31-0:06:39</a>:</strong>  I grew up with a lot of interest in the environment and natural systems and most of my hobbies<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:39">0:06:39-0:06:44</a>:</strong>  and pastimes relate to something to do with the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:44">0:06:44-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  But I was 16 in 1970, so I lived through the 70s as an adolescent young adult and with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:06:54">0:06:54-0:07:03</a>:</strong>  all the dreams of a new world and an alternative world, a counterculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:03">0:07:03-0:07:12</a>:</strong>  Reality kicked in as it does, especially in England when you're not an academic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:12">0:07:12-0:07:19</a>:</strong>  And my trade ended up being mechanical engineering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:19">0:07:19-0:07:28</a>:</strong>  And at a certain point, I got introduced to surfing in the West Country and started to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:28">0:07:28-0:07:36</a>:</strong>  travel and visited a lot of places where we could live longer in the winter and escape<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:36">0:07:36-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  the English winter in a warm surfing type location.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  And with that came a lot of Australian connections and Australian friends.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:07:55</a>:</strong>  I ended up emigrating to Australia in 1979 and within the first 12 months, I realized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:07:55">0:07:55-0:08:02</a>:</strong>  I could work very hard and buy a farm, which was something that was unheard of in England<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:02">0:08:02-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  at that time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:11</a>:</strong>  But I also got introduced to the very early permaculture movement and I just happened<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:11">0:08:11-0:08:18</a>:</strong>  to settle in an area in the Sunshine Coast, southern Queensland, where the largest permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:18">0:08:18-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  group in the world was in action.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:19">0:08:19-0:08:26</a>:</strong>  It's only 150 people and Max Lindegger was a champion of that group.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:26">0:08:26-0:08:34</a>:</strong>  And that led me to take an introduction course and get involved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:34">0:08:34-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  As I was aiming as a hardworking immigrant to this country, I was determined to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:48</a>:</strong>  enough money to buy a farm, which I knew was possible with this large landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:08:48">0:08:48-0:09:01</a>:</strong>  That led me to take a course with Bill Mollison in 1983 in Tasmania and purchased my first<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:01">0:09:01-0:09:08</a>:</strong>  property after a few entrepreneurial events of just generally building up work in businesses<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:08">0:09:08-0:09:12</a>:</strong>  and selling them on so I could buy a farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:12">0:09:12-0:09:20</a>:</strong>  And then the real learning started and I didn't teach until for eight years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:20">0:09:20-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  It was 1991 before I started teaching, but I quickly realized that I seemed to have a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:33</a>:</strong>  talent as a teacher and I got offered aid work overseas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:33">0:09:33-0:09:39</a>:</strong>  I reconnected with Bill when he moved from Tasmania to northern New South Wales, only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:39">0:09:39-0:09:43</a>:</strong>  four hours away, which is not far in Australia by car.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:43">0:09:43-0:09:48</a>:</strong>  And then I was offered aid work and more aid work and as I got successful results, more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:48">0:09:48-0:09:54</a>:</strong>  consultancy eventually, when Bill wanted to retire back to Tasmania, he offered me the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:09:54">0:09:54-0:10:01</a>:</strong>  directorship to manage the Permaculture Institute in northern New South Wales.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:01">0:10:01-0:10:02</a>:</strong>  The rest is history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:02">0:10:02-0:10:06</a>:</strong>  I just kept getting more and more results.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:06">0:10:06-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  It was 1991 when I opted out of the conventional system and decided I was never going to compromise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:24</a>:</strong>  with conventional business and standard modem operandi of living in the consumption world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:24">0:10:24-0:10:29</a>:</strong>  I was only going to work as a permaculture teacher, consultant, aid worker and project<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:29">0:10:29-0:10:37</a>:</strong>  manager and that's what I've been doing ever since.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:37">0:10:37-0:10:43</a>:</strong>  That just led on with resources gathering around me, most of them people and some of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  them wonderful young people like Sam who sat right here next to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:10:58</a>:</strong>  I'm so lucky to have such a fantastically large broad team and most of them, a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:10:58">0:10:58-0:11:06</a>:</strong>  them today are in the IT field because we do a lot of online education and social media<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:06">0:11:06-0:11:08</a>:</strong>  and these sort of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:08">0:11:08-0:11:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah, your outreach has gotten really good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:10">0:11:10-0:11:16</a>:</strong>  In fact, I was on your last online PDC in order to brush up on some of my skills and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:21</a>:</strong>  get an idea for how you guys work on an online platform and it's a really tight program.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:21">0:11:21-0:11:22</a>:</strong>  I've been impressed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:26</a>:</strong>  Now your trajectory has been fantastic and it leads me into the next question that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:26">0:11:26-0:11:31</a>:</strong>  actually coming from my friend and colleague Shad Goodsy, the owner of Atitlan Organics,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:31">0:11:31-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  which is an eight year old off-grid permaculture farm here on Lake Atitlan just up the hill<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:35">0:11:35-0:11:40</a>:</strong>  from us and you might even remember them because you highlighted them on social media a lot,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:40">0:11:40-0:11:42</a>:</strong>  not a whole lot long ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:42">0:11:42-0:11:48</a>:</strong>  Now he asked what aspects of permaculture after about a 30 year trajectory of working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:48">0:11:48-0:11:53</a>:</strong>  in the field are you still most inspired to explore after all these decades of planting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:53">0:11:53-0:11:58</a>:</strong>  tons of trees and gardens and reshaping landscapes?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:11:58">0:11:58-0:12:03</a>:</strong>  What part of this is still pushing you to do more research and continue to push the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:03">0:12:03-0:12:06</a>:</strong>  boundaries of ecosystem regeneration?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:06">0:12:06-0:12:17</a>:</strong>  The whole systems, the social systems, the same as Sam's wonderful experience as a 20<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:18">0:12:18-0:12:20</a>:</strong>  I was 64 year old this year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:20">0:12:20-0:12:25</a>:</strong>  We're at either end of the age groups.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:25">0:12:25-0:12:31</a>:</strong>  Starting local permaculture community groups is something I'm very passionate about and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:31">0:12:31-0:12:38</a>:</strong>  I've got back into it and we're developing a startup kit for anywhere in the world for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:38">0:12:38-0:12:47</a>:</strong>  areas defined by local government where local government influences what we can do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:47">0:12:47-0:12:56</a>:</strong>  That's very much an exciting area and I'm also involved in setting up permaculture eco<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:12:56">0:12:56-0:13:08</a>:</strong>  farming hamlets like Zaytuna Farm which is now transiting towards that type of setup.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:08">0:13:08-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  Designing the community on the ground because I love farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  I'm a really practical person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  I love being on the ground and particularly in the perennial systems and food forests<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:27</a>:</strong>  etc. but local community groups is such a courageous thing to engage in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:27">0:13:27-0:13:33</a>:</strong>  I have one that's over 25 years old that has evolved over time and has bred other groups.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:33">0:13:33-0:13:40</a>:</strong>  That's a model that I'm continuing to refine and extend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:40">0:13:40-0:13:48</a>:</strong>  Now I want to be able to offer a startup kit for anybody to take the same system going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:48">0:13:48-0:13:49</a>:</strong>  forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:49">0:13:49-0:13:56</a>:</strong>  We need one in every local government area on this planet as an example of the people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:13:56">0:13:56-0:14:02</a>:</strong>  who vote in a government and what they actually need to express their needs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:02">0:14:02-0:14:05</a>:</strong>  Absolutely, yeah that is very inspiring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:05">0:14:05-0:14:10</a>:</strong>  Now the flip side for you Sam, just getting started in your permaculture career, where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:10">0:14:10-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  do you draw your inspiration from and where do you really want to move towards going forward?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:21</a>:</strong>  I'm definitely inspired by Jeff's work Greening the Desert.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:21">0:14:21-0:14:28</a>:</strong>  Bioremediation and desertification work in so far as the landscapes is definitely something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:28">0:14:28-0:14:30</a>:</strong>  I want to learn as much as I can about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:30">0:14:30-0:14:36</a>:</strong>  Fungi being such an unexplored area, so anything I can learn to help pillaged and destroyed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:36">0:14:36-0:14:39</a>:</strong>  landscapes because they're growing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:39">0:14:39-0:14:45</a>:</strong>  Anything that can be done to regenerate these things into places that help animals, plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:45">0:14:45-0:14:51</a>:</strong>  and people to thrive and to do well for nature to be at its optimum, to create an abundance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:51">0:14:51-0:14:53</a>:</strong>  on earth that pulls my heart in the biggest way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:53">0:14:53-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  So therefore food forests.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:15:01</a>:</strong>  That in so far as the extent of that I think people are what's going to make it happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:01">0:15:01-0:15:07</a>:</strong>  So this is the passion that pulls me the most, is the way that we can create people ecosystems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:07">0:15:07-0:15:13</a>:</strong>  like Jeff's 25 year old social food forest in the Sunshine Coast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:13">0:15:13-0:15:18</a>:</strong>  To have these models spreading further and further where we can have interactive communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:18">0:15:18-0:15:21</a>:</strong>  that know each other, that support each other just like a diverse ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:21">0:15:21-0:15:26</a>:</strong>  That can look after each other and connected by a web.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:26">0:15:26-0:15:30</a>:</strong>  These things are invaluable as we move forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:30">0:15:30-0:15:31</a>:</strong>  Isolation just isn't going to cut it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:31">0:15:31-0:15:36</a>:</strong>  People doing things by themselves aren't going to make the impact that needs to be made.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:36">0:15:36-0:15:40</a>:</strong>  So the more we can do in connecting people in a common cause, giving people hope and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:40">0:15:40-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  letting them know that this is actually something that has momentum and is moving forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:49</a>:</strong>  That no one doing this work is isolated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:49">0:15:49-0:15:51</a>:</strong>  No one who has these hopes and dreams is alone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:51">0:15:51-0:15:55</a>:</strong>  This is the most essential thing for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:15:55">0:15:55-0:16:04</a>:</strong>  So the more we can actually create opportunities for food forestry and global abundance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:04">0:16:04-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  Wonderful Sam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's really well said and I really echo both of your passion towards the community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:10">0:16:10-0:16:14</a>:</strong>  and the social side of working with people to advance these permaculture goals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:14">0:16:14-0:16:19</a>:</strong>  Now beyond the physical conventions in the land, the structures and the barriers that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:19">0:16:19-0:16:25</a>:</strong>  prevent some of our ambitions on land-based projects, taking the next step and creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:25">0:16:25-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  communities to advance your vision comes with a lot of intricacies and challenges as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:38</a>:</strong>  How have both of you found success in working at the community and the personal level to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:38">0:16:38-0:16:44</a>:</strong>  help to advance this goal of landscape regeneration and healthier economies and communities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:44">0:16:44-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  Well a lot of it's about tolerance and being able to listen to what people need.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:16:59</a>:</strong>  Unlike any design, it's a matter of allowing your group to demonstrate its evolutions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:16:59">0:16:59-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  So you have to allow the ecosystem to evolve, whether it's a food forest or it's a food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:12</a>:</strong>  forest of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:12">0:17:12-0:17:14</a>:</strong>  Could you clarify that idea?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:14">0:17:14-0:17:18</a>:</strong>  Tell me what you mean by a food forest of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:18">0:17:18-0:17:23</a>:</strong>  It doesn't work if you have everybody from the same age group and subculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:23">0:17:23-0:17:29</a>:</strong>  It has to be a diversity of people, so that way you influence local politicians.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:29">0:17:29-0:17:35</a>:</strong>  So when a local politician comes into a room where 100 people meet once a month, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:35">0:17:35-0:17:41</a>:</strong>  always at least 100 people, and there's every age group of people, every profession of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:41">0:17:41-0:17:49</a>:</strong>  There's people from different backgrounds and there's people from different socioeconomic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:49">0:17:49-0:17:51</a>:</strong>  areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:51">0:17:51-0:17:56</a>:</strong>  It's a great diversity and that's what looks like a massive voting block because the politician<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:56">0:17:56-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  then sees every person in that room.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:05</a>:</strong>  There's 20 voters who think the same way, so they better understand what you're about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:05">0:18:05-0:18:08</a>:</strong>  otherwise they're looking political death in the eye.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:08">0:18:08-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  So it's one way of passively holding our politicians accountable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:21</a>:</strong>  They need to know what you're about and why you meet as a regular well attended group<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:21">0:18:21-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  of people and what you then do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  What you do is you listen to each other and what is required.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:37</a>:</strong>  People may meet and they say, well, we're growing all this stuff, we've passed on information,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:37">0:18:37-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  you might have some ground rules like we meet at the same time every month at the same place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  We keep information about what has been successful and what has failed so we can share that information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:58</a>:</strong>  We keep education at the center of the group with the PDC, the Permaculture Design certificate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:18:58">0:18:58-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  course as the main education component.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:05</a>:</strong>  And that can be a part time course, so everybody's a local who attends.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:05">0:19:05-0:19:11</a>:</strong>  But then there can be all these different specialist courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:11">0:19:11-0:19:17</a>:</strong>  We keep promoting permaculture in home gardens, small acreage, large farms, streetscapes and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:17">0:19:17-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  even industrial areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:26</a>:</strong>  But then you might then find that once you start developing, and I think you will find<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:26">0:19:26-0:19:31</a>:</strong>  that people will say, well, we might be growing all these new things and developing all this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:31">0:19:31-0:19:41</a>:</strong>  stuff but how do we process it or what are the best recipes to create to cook this stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:41">0:19:41-0:19:43</a>:</strong>  or preserve this stuff or ferment this stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:43">0:19:43-0:19:45</a>:</strong>  So those are extra workshops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:45">0:19:45-0:19:50</a>:</strong>  That ends up being cooking workshops, processing workshops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:50">0:19:50-0:19:56</a>:</strong>  But that also ends up being a recipe book for the local group and the local area and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:19:56">0:19:56-0:20:01</a>:</strong>  it has a place and a date on it, at least a month.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:01">0:20:01-0:20:09</a>:</strong>  So it's the place where the group is centered with 12 months of the year, one recipe book<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:09">0:20:09-0:20:14</a>:</strong>  for each month because in that month only certain things are ripe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:14">0:20:14-0:20:17</a>:</strong>  Some things are ripe all the time but some things are only ripe in a certain period of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:17">0:20:17-0:20:21</a>:</strong>  time and then all the recipes are relevant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:21">0:20:21-0:20:24</a>:</strong>  So that is an evolution which often is requested.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:24">0:20:24-0:20:32</a>:</strong>  So in many groups you have that local recipe book created that has a place and month of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:32">0:20:32-0:20:36</a>:</strong>  the year relevant, 12 recipe books.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:36">0:20:36-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  And on you go, listening to what your local community required, just like you look at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  the responses of a perennial ecosystem, i.e. a food forest, and see what grows well in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:20:53</a>:</strong>  the shade and what doesn't, what needs more sun, what grows in little open spaces, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:53">0:20:53-0:20:56</a>:</strong>  are the better climates, what are the better fruit trees, etc. etc.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:56">0:20:56-0:20:59</a>:</strong>  And you extend on successes and you reduce failures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:20:59">0:20:59-0:21:00</a>:</strong>  Marvelous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:00">0:21:00-0:21:03</a>:</strong>  Do you have anything to add to that, Sam?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:03">0:21:03-0:21:08</a>:</strong>  Have you discovered any barriers or challenges when you are working on a community scale<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:08">0:21:08-0:21:14</a>:</strong>  or social scale in helping to promote permaculture within communities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:14">0:21:14-0:21:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:15">0:21:15-0:21:19</a>:</strong>  I think a prime example is living at Jeff's farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:19">0:21:19-0:21:22</a>:</strong>  Community living, when you're not accustomed to it, is hard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:22">0:21:22-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  There's lots of things that you have to learn about yourself and about interacting with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:31</a>:</strong>  people that has to happen quickly because people are diverse.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:31">0:21:31-0:21:35</a>:</strong>  We have from here people from all over the world with all different persuasions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:35">0:21:35-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  The only thing connecting and uniting them being permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  And this is the same throughout the whole world now as our cultures diversify and become<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  broader and broader insofar as the people that it contains.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  So we have to learn to adapt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:56</a>:</strong>  We have to learn to be like our forests, which is tying back into a discussion before with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:56">0:21:56-0:21:59</a>:</strong>  what a social food forest is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:21:59">0:21:59-0:22:02</a>:</strong>  It's an abundant social system is how I understand it and say it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:02">0:22:02-0:22:04</a>:</strong>  We don't want to create social deserts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:04">0:22:04-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  We don't want to create social monocultures where everyone nods and just allows things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:10</a>:</strong>  to happen, which is what we've seen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:10">0:22:10-0:22:15</a>:</strong>  We see a situation where people don't feel that they have power to grow and diversify<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:15">0:22:15-0:22:16</a>:</strong>  themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:16">0:22:16-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  They don't have the power to be abundant like a forest or to create the things that they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:25</a>:</strong>  need to see and do in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:25">0:22:25-0:22:30</a>:</strong>  We might have a constitution of generally how we behave like the grand rules, the basic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:30">0:22:30-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  grand rules, but then we might have bylaws and we agree on bylaws.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:35</a>:</strong>  They can be flexible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:35">0:22:35-0:22:41</a>:</strong>  And here it's like there are things like, you know, we switch roles at times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:41">0:22:41-0:22:45</a>:</strong>  We work on small animals, we work on large animals, we work on crop systems, we work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:45">0:22:45-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  on natural fertilizer, we work on nursery systems, we work on food forests, we work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:22:56</a>:</strong>  on infrastructure, and then we switch around.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:22:56">0:22:56-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  But we also work on, there are times when we all work together before breakfast for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:05</a>:</strong>  two hours and then we have three meals a day together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:05">0:23:05-0:23:11</a>:</strong>  You know, there's an average of 30 people on this property, so we serve from our kitchen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:11">0:23:11-0:23:16</a>:</strong>  30,000 meals a year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:16">0:23:16-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  And not everybody's a meat eater, but many are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:23</a>:</strong>  I'm a meat eater and Sam's a vegan, but we eat together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:23">0:23:23-0:23:24</a>:</strong>  It's okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:24">0:23:24-0:23:25</a>:</strong>  We tolerate each other over that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:25">0:23:25-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  And Sam knows animals are processed and that's okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:33</a>:</strong>  And we don't attack each other over it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:33">0:23:33-0:23:38</a>:</strong>  But we all clean together and we all agree how we use the compost toilets and we all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:38">0:23:38-0:23:42</a>:</strong>  agree how we behave and we agree on what we don't do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:42">0:23:42-0:23:45</a>:</strong>  We don't have alcohol and drugs on the property because everybody needs to have a clear head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:45">0:23:45-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  We're all very serious about what we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:23:54</a>:</strong>  We agree on when we use the washing machine, let's say, because we're completely off-grid.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:54">0:23:54-0:23:56</a>:</strong>  We're all on battery solar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:56">0:23:56-0:23:59</a>:</strong>  Here we have nickel-iron battery banks and lots of solar panels.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:23:59">0:23:59-0:24:03</a>:</strong>  But we all know that you can't use ridiculous amounts of electricity once the sun's gone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:03">0:24:03-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:08</a>:</strong>  And we're all on our own drinking water and we're all on compost toilets and we're all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:08">0:24:08-0:24:10</a>:</strong>  on reed bed grey water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:10">0:24:10-0:24:14</a>:</strong>  There are obvious rules of how you work with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:14">0:24:14-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  And it's pretty obvious if you don't understand it, people will help you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:22</a>:</strong>  And if it doesn't work for you, then you're not going to fit in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:22">0:24:22-0:24:24</a>:</strong>  And that's okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:24">0:24:24-0:24:25</a>:</strong>  That's fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:25">0:24:25-0:24:26</a>:</strong>  Some people won't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:26">0:24:26-0:24:27</a>:</strong>  That's all right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:30</a>:</strong>  So we've got those things sort of worked out, I think.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:30">0:24:30-0:24:37</a>:</strong>  I'll just quickly expand on other challenges in living in community or doing community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:37">0:24:37-0:24:43</a>:</strong>  projects can be our own conditioning and our own bias, which is something we need to really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:43">0:24:43-0:24:47</a>:</strong>  hold ourselves accountable for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:47">0:24:47-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  When I ran for council, I had this understanding or this bias towards the council and towards<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:24:56</a>:</strong>  politicians.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:24:56">0:24:56-0:25:01</a>:</strong>  I had this idea that it was all their fault, the situation that we were in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:01">0:25:01-0:25:09</a>:</strong>  And it was a really steep learning curve because people who are invested in the local council<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:09">0:25:09-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  don't want to hear your criticism and will take you down if you say it too loud.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:23</a>:</strong>  And so it became a real awareness for me that for me to utilize permaculture teachers to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:23">0:25:23-0:25:28</a>:</strong>  see the problem as the solution to work with nature's strengths rather than against it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:28">0:25:28-0:25:35</a>:</strong>  and seeing the council as like a dense jungle that I've got to somehow find my way into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:35">0:25:35-0:25:41</a>:</strong>  or a big open desert that I've got to secure some sort of water in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:41">0:25:41-0:25:48</a>:</strong>  I had to adapt myself to that situation and become compassionate and understanding of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:25:49</a>:</strong>  people's worldviews.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:49">0:25:49-0:25:57</a>:</strong>  I was standing outside a ticketing booth with people of all different cultural and political<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:25:57">0:25:57-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  orientations handing out tickets and having, from what I understood, was ultimately they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  wanted the best things that they understood to be for the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  Someone wanted it through money and jobs, another wanted it through environmental protection,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:17</a>:</strong>  another wanted it from unions, whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:17">0:26:17-0:26:22</a>:</strong>  It was just different language, different lingo and a different understanding for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:22">0:26:22-0:26:27</a>:</strong>  same thing that they felt that they couldn't implement and therefore a politician had to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:27">0:26:27-0:26:35</a>:</strong>  I found living in this community, as long as living in other communities, that the more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:35">0:26:35-0:26:40</a>:</strong>  empowered people are to just do what they feel they need to do in order to support and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:40">0:26:40-0:26:45</a>:</strong>  help the world, the more there's a common culture of caring for one another because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:45">0:26:45-0:26:51</a>:</strong>  you know one another, because you see another go through and are isolated in your own apartment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:51">0:26:51-0:26:55</a>:</strong>  or your own box, not knowing your neighbour, the more you can create a culture of care<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:55">0:26:55-0:26:58</a>:</strong>  and connection and empowerment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:26:58">0:26:58-0:27:02</a>:</strong>  The more things just get done rather than relying on a government to do it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:02">0:27:02-0:27:06</a>:</strong>  I think that this is one of the biggest challenges we face, is a common idea or a common culture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:06">0:27:06-0:27:07</a>:</strong>  of blame.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:07">0:27:07-0:27:12</a>:</strong>  Well, I think that's a remarkable insight and an incredible opportunity to have gotten<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:12">0:27:12-0:27:16</a>:</strong>  an experience with so early in your learning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:16">0:27:16-0:27:21</a>:</strong>  My question then would be, what is the challenge of getting regenerative land management, permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:21">0:27:21-0:27:25</a>:</strong>  and economic policies implemented on a government level?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:25">0:27:25-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  I know at this point you've both mentioned that it's something that needs to happen,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:34</a>:</strong>  but do you find it more worthwhile to go directly to that channel or better perhaps to stay<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:34">0:27:34-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  focused on grassroots initiatives?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:41</a>:</strong>  I think you've got to set examples because we're in the information age and we're in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:41">0:27:41-0:27:47</a>:</strong>  the YouTube age and the Facebook age and the Instagram age and everything's high definition<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:47">0:27:47-0:27:50</a>:</strong>  even out of a phone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:50">0:27:50-0:27:56</a>:</strong>  The evidence is obvious and in every way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:27:56">0:27:56-0:28:04</a>:</strong>  Your glory shots of regeneration, your glory shots of recovery, your glory shots of community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:04">0:28:04-0:28:08</a>:</strong>  are all believable out of a mobile smartphone today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:08">0:28:08-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  That's gone right out through the world, through every community, even some of the poorest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  and some of the most remote.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:22</a>:</strong>  So, it obviously is seen by government and it's at a stage where it can't really be ignored.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:22">0:28:22-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  So, we can stay at grassroots and still be global.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:30</a>:</strong>  I would say grassroots is the only real way to make things happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:30">0:28:30-0:28:36</a>:</strong>  Like before, saying that we live in a common culture of blame or that that seems to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:36">0:28:36-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  the biggest inhibitor is just that, is the more we can step out of blame and more into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:47</a>:</strong>  affirmative action of just doing because it's what the world needs and because what will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:47">0:28:47-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  satisfy us, give us greater happiness and greatest joy in our lives.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:53">0:28:53-0:28:57</a>:</strong>  It's a good reason to do anything really, especially something that makes the world<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:28:58</a>:</strong>  incredible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:28:58">0:28:58-0:29:05</a>:</strong>  So, for us to take affirmative action for ourselves is I think much more powerful worldwide<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:05">0:29:05-0:29:07</a>:</strong>  than a government doing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:07">0:29:07-0:29:13</a>:</strong>  Well, it also seems to me like it's a good sort of litmus test or kind of a way of finding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:13">0:29:13-0:29:20</a>:</strong>  out whether your initiatives or your projects can really take root in a community is by<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:20">0:29:20-0:29:27</a>:</strong>  trying them out first at the personal level and seeing how it's adopted and if it continues<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:27">0:29:27-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  to move forward with any steam sort of after the initial excitement of getting a project<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:33">0:29:33-0:29:37</a>:</strong>  And then maybe from there, once the concept is proven, it's something that you can take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:37">0:29:37-0:29:39</a>:</strong>  to a higher platform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:39">0:29:39-0:29:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah, what's that all about?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:42">0:29:42-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:49</a>:</strong>  But if we can do it in a seditious way, then that's fine too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:49">0:29:49-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  We don't need the government to do what we need to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:29:52</a>:</strong>  Of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:52">0:29:52-0:29:57</a>:</strong>  And it's kind of very hard for them to stop us as well, especially if we do it en masse.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:29:57">0:29:57-0:30:07</a>:</strong>  But at the same time, I understand if we were to do a social site analysis and we see the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:07">0:30:07-0:30:16</a>:</strong>  government or the council as a climatic factor or some sort of factor affecting us, then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:16">0:30:16-0:30:20</a>:</strong>  we must use that to our benefit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:20">0:30:20-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  And this is where the resources, connections to council can be a beautiful, wonderful thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:33</a>:</strong>  where them supporting and actively engaging in what we're doing is not something we should<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:33">0:30:33-0:30:41</a>:</strong>  ever say no to, which is why these projects on the ground, these grassroots projects to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:41">0:30:41-0:30:48</a>:</strong>  have government engagement happening in some places, not happening in others, but even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:48">0:30:48-0:30:52</a>:</strong>  just a twinkle of it is a more than exciting thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:52">0:30:52-0:30:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah, those are some great insights.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:30:59</a>:</strong>  And now that we've talked a lot about some of the larger ideas of moving forward with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:30:59">0:30:59-0:31:04</a>:</strong>  communities and instilling inspiration and kind of spreading these ideas, let's take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:04">0:31:04-0:31:09</a>:</strong>  a little step back now and talk about some of the technical aspects that make these things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:09">0:31:09-0:31:10</a>:</strong>  happen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:10">0:31:10-0:31:14</a>:</strong>  Now, Jeff, I know that you came to Guatemala quite a few years back and I'm specifically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:14">0:31:14-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  wondering what your impression of the country here was and some of your thoughts on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:24</a>:</strong>  relevance, especially of permaculture to the indigenous communities here in Guatemala,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:24">0:31:24-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  because there are very few countries around the world that still have such a high percentage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:34</a>:</strong>  of the population of indigenous people who are still connected to their traditions and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:34">0:31:34-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  their culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:44</a>:</strong>  Oh, well, I think it's extremely relevant that the land distribution, as I understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:44">0:31:44-0:31:50</a>:</strong>  it, and it was a while ago I was there, was something that was quite restrictive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:50">0:31:50-0:31:55</a>:</strong>  People were walking a very long way to small blocks of land from very small blocks of land<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:55">0:31:55-0:31:57</a>:</strong>  within town.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:31:57">0:31:57-0:32:01</a>:</strong>  And they kind of lost concentration on the very small blocks of land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:01">0:32:01-0:32:07</a>:</strong>  And most people were involved in a coffee culture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:07">0:32:07-0:32:15</a>:</strong>  So there was a sort of small sort of two-acre coffee culture mentality where people sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:15">0:32:15-0:32:21</a>:</strong>  of felt that to be rich was to do well in coffee, and all the blocks were a long way<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:21">0:32:21-0:32:25</a>:</strong>  from where people lived.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:25">0:32:25-0:32:30</a>:</strong>  And that made things quite awkward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:30">0:32:30-0:32:39</a>:</strong>  But in the early stages, we were able to encourage people to go not only organic but into more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:49</a>:</strong>  diverse systems that are nice, simple but elegant food forest-type assemblies to at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:49">0:32:49-0:32:57</a>:</strong>  least make their small coffee plantations more sustainable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:32:57">0:32:57-0:33:04</a>:</strong>  There was obviously enormous amounts of land that was way too steep being cultivated, as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:04">0:33:04-0:33:11</a>:</strong>  I remember, and just those difficulties with the way the land was distributed and the way<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:11">0:33:11-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  people had got used to walking so far out to their blocks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:19</a>:</strong>  No, that's a pretty accurate description of many of the challenges that are still going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:19">0:33:19-0:33:20</a>:</strong>  on in this region.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:20">0:33:20-0:33:25</a>:</strong>  Now, obviously it's an extremely diverse country and one of the most biodiverse regions anywhere<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:25">0:33:25-0:33:30</a>:</strong>  in the world, but you described it very well, especially where we are, that that is one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:30">0:33:30-0:33:33</a>:</strong>  of the continuing challenges of this region.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:33">0:33:33-0:33:38</a>:</strong>  These cafetal systems, which are all over the valley in Sununna where we live here as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:38">0:33:38-0:33:44</a>:</strong>  well, that are kind of minimally tended and harvested once, sometimes twice a year depending<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:44">0:33:44-0:33:47</a>:</strong>  on the season and the breed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:47">0:33:47-0:33:53</a>:</strong>  And I'm working with a lot of organizations, especially Atitlan Organics and EMAP, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:53">0:33:53-0:33:58</a>:</strong>  you helped to found back in the 90s, if I remember correctly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:33:58">0:33:58-0:34:04</a>:</strong>  And both of those organizations are really pushing forward to help polyculture and more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:04">0:34:04-0:34:11</a>:</strong>  diverse systems within the cash crop model of coffee production, as well as the production<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:11">0:34:11-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  of some more indigenous food sources, as well as seed saving.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  So could you tell us a little bit about how you first got the Mesoamerican Institute of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:24</a>:</strong>  Permaculture started and how that process really took hold?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:32</a>:</strong>  Well, I was invited in by Permaculture America Latina to teach a course there and my administrator<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:32">0:34:32-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  didn't make it in because he didn't get his visa and was never allowed into Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:42</a>:</strong>  So I was stuck with a young Australian translator and I had to pull it off myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:42">0:34:42-0:34:46</a>:</strong>  And it was a difficult block of land because it flooded.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:46">0:34:46-0:34:58</a>:</strong>  It was the Exe Army camp during the conflict as the barrier section going into San Lucas<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:34:58">0:34:58-0:35:00</a>:</strong>  Tolley Man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:00">0:35:00-0:35:04</a>:</strong>  But we put four swales through the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:04">0:35:04-0:35:05</a>:</strong>  I designed it up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:05">0:35:05-0:35:09</a>:</strong>  I taught a PDC, a Permaculture Design Certificate course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:09">0:35:09-0:35:16</a>:</strong>  I explained the benefit of swales to reduce the flooding and sink the water into the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:16">0:35:16-0:35:20</a>:</strong>  And I put in more perennial systems as an example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:20">0:35:20-0:35:23</a>:</strong>  We actually didn't do a lot of coffee in that zone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:23">0:35:23-0:35:29</a>:</strong>  It was more diverse than that because it was right in town, really just on the edge of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:29">0:35:29-0:35:30</a>:</strong>  town.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:30">0:35:30-0:35:34</a>:</strong>  We actually linked into the abattoir next door and got quite a lot of manure in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:34">0:35:34-0:35:35</a>:</strong>  top swale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:35">0:35:35-0:35:42</a>:</strong>  The next year I came back almost exactly a year later and they finished off the refined<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:42">0:35:42-0:35:43</a>:</strong>  design earthworks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:43">0:35:43-0:35:53</a>:</strong>  And I immediately woke up in the morning in a repurposed grain silo, which was an ex-aid<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:53">0:35:53-0:35:54</a>:</strong>  project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:35:54">0:35:54-0:36:00</a>:</strong>  I mean, the whole project was surrounded by failed aid projects going back to the 50s,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:00">0:36:00-0:36:03</a>:</strong>  which is quite normal if anybody's worked in aid.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:03">0:36:03-0:36:08</a>:</strong>  There's just endless aid infrastructure fading away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:08">0:36:08-0:36:15</a>:</strong>  And I woke up in this, I'd come in at night and I woke up with this quite good view from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:15">0:36:15-0:36:20</a>:</strong>  this grain silo that had been turned into a two-story accommodation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:20">0:36:20-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  Fitted out with silky oak, what you call gravileia there, gravilia robusta, which is an Australian<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  tree endemic to where we are talking to right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:34</a>:</strong>  And nobody knew that you could use it for timber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:34">0:36:34-0:36:39</a>:</strong>  It had been cut for a high pollard over the coffee as a shade coffee and only I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:39">0:36:39-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  the plantation owners were taking the high quality timber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:46</a>:</strong>  But I told everybody that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:46">0:36:46-0:36:51</a>:</strong>  So I was in this beautiful, fitted out two-story accommodation and I looked out the window<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:51">0:36:51-0:36:56</a>:</strong>  and immediately I thought, I don't need to be here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:56">0:36:56-0:36:57</a>:</strong>  They already know exactly what I'm doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:57">0:36:57-0:36:59</a>:</strong>  Isn't that a nice feeling, ironically?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:36:59">0:36:59-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  It was wonderful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  I mean, I walked out on my own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:04</a>:</strong>  I can remember it quite distinctly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:04">0:37:04-0:37:09</a>:</strong>  I got stung by a bee as well, right in between my thumb and my forefinger as I put my hand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:09">0:37:09-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  in my pocket.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:12</a>:</strong>  It must have been on the rim of my hip pocket.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:12">0:37:12-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  It kind of gave me a little bit of sting symbiosis, I thought.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:19</a>:</strong>  That's quite a bit of Guatemala I'm not going to easily get.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:19">0:37:19-0:37:20</a>:</strong>  And it didn't worry me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:20">0:37:20-0:37:22</a>:</strong>  And I'm walking around thinking, I really don't have to be here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:22">0:37:22-0:37:24</a>:</strong>  These guys have really, really got it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:24">0:37:24-0:37:27</a>:</strong>  I mean, they've just totally got it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:27">0:37:27-0:37:35</a>:</strong>  And I knew Ronaldo would be totally connected to the Cachacil people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:35">0:37:35-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  And his ambition was to get it out to all the five Mesoamerican countries and all the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:43</a>:</strong>  main indigenous people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:43">0:37:43-0:37:49</a>:</strong>  But the thing is that many things have happened since then in the world of permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:49">0:37:49-0:37:54</a>:</strong>  We were interviewing Eric Tonesmeyer just the other day, who co-wrote the book with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:54">0:37:54-0:37:56</a>:</strong>  Dave Jackie, Forest Gardening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:37:56">0:37:56-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  And he's done some incredible work and he's published more work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  He is literally one of the great permaculture mavins.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  He's now a Yale lecturer on agroforestry, food forestry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:18</a>:</strong>  He said that he now has proof that when you take a monoculture like palm oil or coffee<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:18">0:38:18-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  or cacao into a polyculture, you actually increase the production of the original monoculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:26">0:38:26-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  And you get the additional polycultural yields.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:36</a>:</strong>  So this is now becoming things that have been well researched and are now proven.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:36">0:38:36-0:38:43</a>:</strong>  So there's absolutely no reason not to make that conversion over all of these lands and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:43">0:38:43-0:38:48</a>:</strong>  get out of this crazy monocultural situation because it's not as productive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:48">0:38:48-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  It's obviously not as stable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:57</a>:</strong>  Now that gives you extra yield, but it also gives you time to do things traditionally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:57">0:38:57-0:38:59</a>:</strong>  back at your home base.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:38:59">0:38:59-0:39:07</a>:</strong>  Because if you look at permaculture two, actually, is it permaculture one or permaculture two,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:07">0:39:07-0:39:15</a>:</strong>  the original books that Bill wrote, the first garden that Bill honors is a traditional Guatemalan<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:15">0:39:15-0:39:18</a>:</strong>  home garden and all its polyculture elements.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:18">0:39:18-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  So it's actually in the tradition of Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:29</a>:</strong>  Now just to finish this little story off, the testament after that second visit, not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:29">0:39:29-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  long after, I was still in touch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:36</a>:</strong>  I haven't needed to be in touch because if I wanted to come to Guatemala and see the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:36">0:39:36-0:39:41</a>:</strong>  guys at IMAP, it would be for me to learn about permaculture in Guatemala, not for me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:41">0:39:41-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  to teach them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:43</a>:</strong>  That's for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:43">0:39:43-0:39:46</a>:</strong>  They'd know more about permaculture in Guatemala than I'll ever know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:46">0:39:46-0:39:54</a>:</strong>  I'm just a rough mainframe designer who's spread all over the world, basically lighting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:54">0:39:54-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  fires in people's minds and activities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:40:02</a>:</strong>  But after that second visit, next year you had Hurricane Mitch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:02">0:40:02-0:40:09</a>:</strong>  And Hurricane Mitch came in over the Gulf of Mexico, out of the Caribbean, and sat right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:09">0:40:09-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  on top of Guatemala and dumped about eight meters of rain right down on that region.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:18</a>:</strong>  And I'm thinking, wow, what the hell happened?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:18">0:40:18-0:40:19</a>:</strong>  So I got in touch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:21</a>:</strong>  It was kind of early internet days.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:21">0:40:21-0:40:23</a>:</strong>  I got in touch and I said, what happened?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:23">0:40:23-0:40:24</a>:</strong>  What happened?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:24">0:40:24-0:40:26</a>:</strong>  How did it handle it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:26">0:40:26-0:40:27</a>:</strong>  And it starts just amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:27">0:40:27-0:40:29</a>:</strong>  It handled it perfect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:29">0:40:29-0:40:32</a>:</strong>  Yes, we got it flooded, but it handled the flood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:32">0:40:32-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  And we harvested about 30 meters of high quality soil, which is now raised this further out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  of the flood because we just pulled that out of the swell trenches and spread it over the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:47</a>:</strong>  land and we're getting higher every time one of those things wants to dump on us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:47">0:40:47-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  And it was that easy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:54</a>:</strong>  The biggest problem that happened, land slips, devastation everywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:54">0:40:54-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  And our site got a benefit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:02</a>:</strong>  And that's recently happened last year here where we had Cyclone Debbie hit us here, we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:02">0:41:02-0:41:05</a>:</strong>  nowhere near that amount of rain, but we had massive floods here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:05">0:41:05-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  I recently made a video about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:12</a>:</strong>  And our landscape, it fell apart, but we actually had nothing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:12">0:41:12-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  We gained soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:18</a>:</strong>  So this is, you know, talk about turn the problem into the solution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:18">0:41:18-0:41:19</a>:</strong>  It's literally there in action.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:19">0:41:19-0:41:24</a>:</strong>  We need to make, you know, you need to make films about these things and make it blatantly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:24">0:41:24-0:41:30</a>:</strong>  obvious in high def and cartoons and every other way you can transfer information.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:30">0:41:30-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  So you know, because people believe screens more than they believe reality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:38</a>:</strong>  You can walk people around the real landscape and a lot of them just literally cannot see<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:38">0:41:38-0:41:39</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:39">0:41:39-0:41:45</a>:</strong>  And they will see it on screen and then they'll go to learn how to see it because it is it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:45">0:41:45-0:41:47</a>:</strong>  is a change in the way you see the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:47">0:41:47-0:41:49</a>:</strong>  It literally is literally with your eyes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:49">0:41:49-0:41:52</a>:</strong>  It's a way you use your literally use your eyes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:52">0:41:52-0:41:53</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:53">0:41:53-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  Those types of examples are really inspiring.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:00</a>:</strong>  And we've had a lot of cases like that here in our valley as well with designs that we've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:00">0:42:00-0:42:03</a>:</strong>  done ourselves and that some of our clients have run with on their own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:03">0:42:03-0:42:09</a>:</strong>  Those big weather events which previously were big erosive forces and were damaging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:09">0:42:09-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  the land when certain, you know, almost chiropractic adjustments are made to handle that type of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  a hit, absorb the nutrients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:21</a>:</strong>  And especially for the fact that so many of the surrounding properties are not managed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:21">0:42:21-0:42:23</a>:</strong>  the same way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:23">0:42:23-0:42:29</a>:</strong>  Their loss is the gain for these properties that have implemented these systems and shifted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:29">0:42:29-0:42:33</a>:</strong>  towards a more resilient way of dealing with large weather events, which, you know, as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:33">0:42:33-0:42:36</a>:</strong>  we all know, are becoming much more frequent as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:36">0:42:36-0:42:40</a>:</strong>  So a time for change and implementation of these is very urgent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:40">0:42:40-0:42:42</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:42">0:42:42-0:42:47</a>:</strong>  So now you mentioned earlier, you know, now that they've become established and have really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:47">0:42:47-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  run with some of the initial ideas that you helped to propagate in this area as far as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:42:57</a>:</strong>  permaculture design, you also mentioned that you're somewhat of a mainframe operator and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:42:57">0:42:57-0:43:03</a>:</strong>  your main job is to sort of instill inspiration and light a fire in the places that you go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:03">0:43:03-0:43:09</a>:</strong>  But within that, there are still some general broad strokes that can be made in most regions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:09">0:43:09-0:43:14</a>:</strong>  in order to help make a transition and create resilience in the landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:14">0:43:14-0:43:19</a>:</strong>  Could you talk about some of those broad strokes and Sam, maybe some of your own observations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:19">0:43:19-0:43:25</a>:</strong>  as you're learning as well that apply to a lot of regions and are generally true across<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:25">0:43:25-0:43:27</a>:</strong>  differences in climate and geography?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:27">0:43:27-0:43:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:28">0:43:28-0:43:37</a>:</strong>  Well, for me, it's water, access and structures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:37">0:43:37-0:43:48</a>:</strong>  Water is such a crucial element for life, obviously, and it behaves in quite a few constant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:43:48">0:43:48-0:44:00</a>:</strong>  ways and when anything in this universe acts in a constant way, then it becomes a secure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:00">0:44:00-0:44:02</a>:</strong>  element to design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:02">0:44:02-0:44:11</a>:</strong>  So water acts in quite a few ways with evaporation, cooling the air and condensation warming the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:11">0:44:11-0:44:16</a>:</strong>  air and water sitting perfectly level and not moving uphill for free, but flowing out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:16">0:44:16-0:44:22</a>:</strong>  on contour, soaking in and only traveling at right angle to contour through the landscape,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:22">0:44:22-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  even when it's moving so slowly underground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:33</a>:</strong>  Those ways of designing water so it's pacified, taking the longest path over the most distance,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:33">0:44:33-0:44:38</a>:</strong>  moving as slowly as possible with as much passive friction as you can achieve, rubbing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:38">0:44:38-0:44:45</a>:</strong>  up against as many beneficial living elements as possible is a sort of approach to water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:45">0:44:45-0:44:53</a>:</strong>  Picking up as much hardware as possible where water runs off 100% runoff surfaces and pass<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:53">0:44:53-0:44:55</a>:</strong>  upon it and spreading it and soaking it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:44:55">0:44:55-0:45:01</a>:</strong>  So what Brad Lancaster in Tucson, Arizona calls planting the rain, planting the runoff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:01">0:45:01-0:45:07</a>:</strong>  or even planting surplus irrigation and then offering those options.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:07">0:45:07-0:45:12</a>:</strong>  Now then those patterns are reasonably constant because the landscape itself is a continuum<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:12">0:45:12-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  of forms shaped by the cosmic forces millennia of meteorological events, weather events.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  So then your access has to compromise with that, has to cooperate with that, has to run<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:35</a>:</strong>  in harmony with it and your access can be a benefit to the water itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:35">0:45:35-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  But it has costs in different cultures, in different worlds, it has different costs and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:46</a>:</strong>  it comes in different forms and a lot of places in the developed world it definitely involves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:46">0:45:46-0:45:48</a>:</strong>  motor vehicles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  And then there are minor access branchways that all can be designed to harmonize with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  water and cooperate with the water design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:46:02</a>:</strong>  And then it becomes very obvious where your infrastructure options are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:02">0:46:02-0:46:09</a>:</strong>  Now those infrastructure itself has to be well designed in relation to both climate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:09">0:46:09-0:46:13</a>:</strong>  and landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:13">0:46:13-0:46:19</a>:</strong>  Good infrastructure works well with climate and the landscape that you're working in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:19">0:46:19-0:46:21</a>:</strong>  And then you've got a pretty good mainframe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:21">0:46:21-0:46:29</a>:</strong>  Now obviously the next thing is who's your client and what is their requirements and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:29">0:46:29-0:46:37</a>:</strong>  you may have to find out what's their budget, what's their time frame, what's their availability<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:37">0:46:37-0:46:46</a>:</strong>  of involvement and what's their experience.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:46">0:46:46-0:46:49</a>:</strong>  And you've got a basic mainframe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:49">0:46:49-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  Wherever you're talking about it, size of land obviously comes into play as well there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:46:55">0:46:55-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  But whether you're talking about a client in different countries or a community in different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:06</a>:</strong>  countries or a government in different countries or a corporation in different countries, whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:06">0:47:06-0:47:14</a>:</strong>  they're trying to design, whatever their ambitions are, that's kind of a mainframe approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:14">0:47:14-0:47:20</a>:</strong>  Doesn't matter whether you're building a city or a giant new industrial economic zone or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:20">0:47:20-0:47:23</a>:</strong>  whatever it is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:23">0:47:23-0:47:30</a>:</strong>  Something that recurringly comes up in permaculture that I can't see as ever being something that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:30">0:47:30-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  could leave, because I think it's the most revolutionary part of permaculture way of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  thinking is pattern recognition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:41</a>:</strong>  Recognizing these water patterns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:41">0:47:41-0:47:47</a>:</strong>  Jeff talks about patterns being the glue in permaculture because you can see how patterns<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:47">0:47:47-0:47:54</a>:</strong>  going across all disciplines, all ways of thinking, how the patterns really influence<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:54">0:47:54-0:47:59</a>:</strong>  your relationship not only to nature but to the land that you're designing, to life and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:47:59">0:47:59-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  everything in general.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:06</a>:</strong>  So as we cultivate a greater understanding of what patterns are, whether that's weather<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:06">0:48:06-0:48:15</a>:</strong>  patterns, whether that's patterns in the soil or whatever else, then these things are things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:15">0:48:15-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  that we can foster, they're the constants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:23</a>:</strong>  And they're the continuous things that help us do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:23">0:48:23-0:48:28</a>:</strong>  I'm glad to hear those answers from both of you and we reflect a lot of these priorities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:28">0:48:28-0:48:31</a>:</strong>  as well in the design criteria checklist that we recently published.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:31">0:48:31-0:48:35</a>:</strong>  So if anybody wants to take a look at those, I'll put the link to that in the show notes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:35">0:48:35-0:48:37</a>:</strong>  for this episode.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:37">0:48:37-0:48:43</a>:</strong>  Now going back and taking maybe a little bit more of a specific look at the parallels between<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:43">0:48:43-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  our similar ecosystems here for us in the highlands in Guatemala and you in your kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:48:53</a>:</strong>  of central coastal region of Australia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:48:53">0:48:53-0:49:01</a>:</strong>  We are here in the high, sorry, we're here in the high elevation subtropics in sort of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:01">0:49:01-0:49:02</a>:</strong>  a wet dry climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:02">0:49:02-0:49:06</a>:</strong>  We're currently in the wet portion right now and we're getting a lot of rain this time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:06">0:49:06-0:49:08</a>:</strong>  of year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:08">0:49:08-0:49:15</a>:</strong>  Obviously there are quite significant differences in geological formations and details within<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:15">0:49:15-0:49:17</a>:</strong>  the climactic system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:17">0:49:17-0:49:25</a>:</strong>  Jeff, have you seen many other climates like this with very successful polyculture systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:25">0:49:25-0:49:30</a>:</strong>  and perennial systems that have found a lot of success within these parameters?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:30">0:49:30-0:49:32</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:32">0:49:32-0:49:39</a>:</strong>  Your climate analog that I remember, I think is you're eight degrees north of the equator<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:39">0:49:39-0:49:42</a>:</strong>  and 2,000 meters above sea level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:47</a>:</strong>  And you'd be about 200 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:47">0:49:47-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  Yep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:52</a>:</strong>  Pretty, pretty similar situations almost exactly to that of EMAP.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:52">0:49:52-0:49:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's what I'm quite something like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:49:54">0:49:54-0:50:02</a>:</strong>  And if you drive from San Lucas, Tolyman downhill towards the west in 15 minutes, you're in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:02">0:50:02-0:50:03</a>:</strong>  the tropics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:03">0:50:03-0:50:04</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:04">0:50:04-0:50:07</a>:</strong>  It descends in elevation very quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:07">0:50:07-0:50:12</a>:</strong>  Because you're so high, 2,000 meters, you're in the subtropics, but you have a tropical<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:12">0:50:12-0:50:13</a>:</strong>  day length.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:13">0:50:13-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  So you don't have an extended winter, you don't have an extended summer or shortened<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:21">0:50:21-0:50:22</a>:</strong>  winter day length.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:22">0:50:22-0:50:31</a>:</strong>  So the sun, you have a tropical sun angle, but you have a temperature range, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:31">0:50:31-0:50:39</a>:</strong>  subtropics because of altitude, because every 100 meters is one meter of latitude.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:39">0:50:39-0:50:41</a>:</strong>  That's a nice climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:41">0:50:41-0:50:45</a>:</strong>  And if you keep going up, you've got temperate climate crops that will grow, but they won't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:45">0:50:45-0:50:48</a>:</strong>  flower because the day length doesn't change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:48">0:50:48-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  So that's always something you've got to take into consideration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:53</a>:</strong>  That has been one of the challenges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:53">0:50:53-0:50:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah, we were growing a lot of things that do well in various other climates, but because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:50:57">0:50:57-0:51:03</a>:</strong>  of the shorter days and the lack of frost, a lot of these things don't end up going out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:03">0:51:03-0:51:05</a>:</strong>  to seed or maturing in the same way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:05">0:51:05-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  So it's fashion crop, which is well known on the television, which has turned our consuming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:23</a>:</strong>  global population into a generic expectation of what they eat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:23">0:51:23-0:51:28</a>:</strong>  When you look at some of the things that Eric Tozmaier is researching, it goes right out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:28">0:51:28-0:51:35</a>:</strong>  to edible willow leaves that grow on the edge of the Arctic Circle, on the edge of the tree<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:35">0:51:35-0:51:36</a>:</strong>  line.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:36">0:51:36-0:51:40</a>:</strong>  And you probably find there's hundreds of perennial crops that nobody eats that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:40">0:51:40-0:51:45</a>:</strong>  possible to grow right where you are that don't worry at all about day length.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:45">0:51:45-0:51:49</a>:</strong>  But no one would want to buy them because they don't know what they are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:49">0:51:49-0:51:54</a>:</strong>  And there's a whole education process that creates an identity for your region, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:54">0:51:54-0:51:55</a>:</strong>  is unique.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:55">0:51:55-0:51:59</a>:</strong>  And that's what makes things sell, really, is having the unique story and stop going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:51:59">0:51:59-0:52:06</a>:</strong>  for the generic identity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:06">0:52:06-0:52:15</a>:</strong>  I mean, we don't want to all be generic humans because there is such wonderful, diverse potential.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:15">0:52:15-0:52:18</a>:</strong>  And you are in a classic volcanic country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:18">0:52:18-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  I think it's four volcanoes around Lake Atilan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:21">0:52:21-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  And if you were paying attention, the Volcan Fuego just went off and there was a major<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:29</a>:</strong>  international disaster here for quite a while.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:29">0:52:29-0:52:30</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:30">0:52:30-0:52:35</a>:</strong>  I always remember digging in the soil and looking at some of the crops and thinking,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:35">0:52:35-0:52:39</a>:</strong>  why aren't strawberries growing so well?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:39">0:52:39-0:52:42</a>:</strong>  This is all indicating you've got lots of rainfall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:42">0:52:42-0:52:46</a>:</strong>  You've got rich, beautiful, rich, deep soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:46">0:52:46-0:52:48</a>:</strong>  Everything looks like it's humid and acid.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:50</a>:</strong>  Why is it indicating alkalinity?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:50">0:52:50-0:52:54</a>:</strong>  And kind of scratching my head as I looked up in the air and thought, there's a smoking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:54">0:52:54-0:52:55</a>:</strong>  volcano.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:55">0:52:55-0:52:56</a>:</strong>  There's another one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:56">0:52:56-0:52:57</a>:</strong>  There's another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:52:57">0:52:57-0:53:00</a>:</strong>  And I'm like, hold on a minute, of course, it's volcanic ash.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:00">0:53:00-0:53:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:01">0:53:01-0:53:02</a>:</strong>  It's alkaline.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:02">0:53:02-0:53:05</a>:</strong>  And why didn't I think that it was alkaline?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:05">0:53:05-0:53:06</a>:</strong>  How stupid am I?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:06">0:53:06-0:53:10</a>:</strong>  I mean, you know, these are the lessons that never leave you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:10">0:53:10-0:53:16</a>:</strong>  And I never, never, never assume a pH scale until I'm absolutely sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:16">0:53:16-0:53:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:17">0:53:17-0:53:20</a>:</strong>  There's such unique factors here, exactly like you mentioned.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:20">0:53:20-0:53:25</a>:</strong>  You can have swamps and deserts that are acid and deserts are oceans of alkalinity, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:25">0:53:25-0:53:29</a>:</strong>  there can be an island of acidity in a swamp.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:29">0:53:29-0:53:32</a>:</strong>  And there are swamps and deserts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:32">0:53:32-0:53:33</a>:</strong>  There are famous swamps and deserts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:33">0:53:33-0:53:40</a>:</strong>  And here you have a climate that's obviously mostly acid, but with so much volcanisms,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:40">0:53:40-0:53:43</a>:</strong>  recent volcanisms, it's all volcanic ash.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:43">0:53:43-0:53:47</a>:</strong>  So you've got to start adapting to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:47">0:53:47-0:53:48</a>:</strong>  And you can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:48">0:53:48-0:53:49</a>:</strong>  It's fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:49">0:53:49-0:53:56</a>:</strong>  But you've just got to have those clues and become aware of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:53:56">0:53:56-0:54:00</a>:</strong>  We're at latitude 28 here, south of the equator.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:00">0:54:00-0:54:05</a>:</strong>  We're 45 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:05">0:54:05-0:54:08</a>:</strong>  And we're only 20 meters above sea level at the bottom of the property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:08">0:54:08-0:54:10</a>:</strong>  And we're 83 at the top of the property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:10">0:54:10-0:54:16</a>:</strong>  So there are things we would share in crops, but there are things that we definitely don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:16">0:54:16-0:54:17</a>:</strong>  share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:17">0:54:17-0:54:20</a>:</strong>  And that's a fantastic thing because I really loved what you mentioned.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:20">0:54:20-0:54:26</a>:</strong>  One of the things that we focus on with our demonstration site here is, yeah, it's tragic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:26">0:54:26-0:54:29</a>:</strong>  how homogenized the global food system has become.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:29">0:54:29-0:54:34</a>:</strong>  And Guatemala, with its very resilient ecosystem because of the rainfall that we get and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:34">0:54:34-0:54:39</a>:</strong>  health of the soils in a lot of places where they haven't been damaged, has been producing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:39">0:54:39-0:54:43</a>:</strong>  so many of these foods that are all for export value.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:43">0:54:43-0:54:49</a>:</strong>  Going from low quality potatoes, broccolis, tomatoes and such, which are not indigenous<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:49">0:54:49-0:54:51</a>:</strong>  to here, but there's a global market for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:51">0:54:51-0:54:56</a>:</strong>  So people are growing and as a result, severely degrading their soils.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:54:56">0:54:56-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  We're trying to promote not only heritage breeds of things that have market value, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  also bringing back to sort of, it hasn't really fallen out of respect, but back to some of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:15</a>:</strong>  the prominence of the heritage and indigenous species that are endemic to the traditional<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:15">0:55:15-0:55:21</a>:</strong>  diet of this area and showing that there's a whole variety of plants that may not be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:21">0:55:21-0:55:26</a>:</strong>  very well understood in Western diets, but that grow really well here, oftentimes are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:26">0:55:26-0:55:32</a>:</strong>  perennial, very, very high producing, extremely nutritious and absolutely delicious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:32">0:55:32-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  And it's just a matter of education to get those back into prominence and popularity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:43</a>:</strong>  So that we can start growing things here again that do well, need less maintenance and rebuild<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:43">0:55:43-0:55:45</a>:</strong>  the soil in the ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:45">0:55:45-0:55:46</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:46">0:55:46-0:55:51</a>:</strong>  And there'd be a lot of global indigenous plants that are from the similar analogs that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:51">0:55:51-0:55:53</a>:</strong>  do well there, too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:55:53">0:55:53-0:56:01</a>:</strong>  So doing a climate analog for your zone would probably link you to places like New Guinea,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:01">0:56:01-0:56:07</a>:</strong>  which would have similar altitudes at similar latitudes or some parts of the South Pacific<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:07">0:56:07-0:56:12</a>:</strong>  would have similar analogs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:12">0:56:12-0:56:17</a>:</strong>  These are all interesting things to compare.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:17">0:56:17-0:56:25</a>:</strong>  And rather than introduce non-natives that are not suited, introduce non-natives that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:25">0:56:25-0:56:33</a>:</strong>  are from the same analogs, which will be just as stable as the endemic and increase the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:33">0:56:33-0:56:36</a>:</strong>  diversity beyond what it's ever been before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:36">0:56:36-0:56:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:37">0:56:37-0:56:40</a>:</strong>  And I mean, we can go back into the geopolitical history of this region, which I've been studying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:40">0:56:40-0:56:42</a>:</strong>  up on a little bit more recently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:42">0:56:42-0:56:48</a>:</strong>  And it's absolutely fascinating how this became a major coffee producing country when coffee<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:48">0:56:48-0:56:52</a>:</strong>  is originally from Ethiopia and Eastern Africa.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:56:52">0:56:52-0:57:00</a>:</strong>  And the indigenous crop here, the heritage versions of cacao are much less prominent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:00">0:57:00-0:57:05</a>:</strong>  in the production of Guatemala, but obviously have moved over, especially in Western Africa,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:05">0:57:05-0:57:09</a>:</strong>  to being one of the higher producing areas around the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:09">0:57:09-0:57:17</a>:</strong>  And just how, you know, colonization and global trade has caused that switch to me is fascinating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:17">0:57:17-0:57:22</a>:</strong>  And working within sort of how both of these regions are developing and re-establishing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:22">0:57:22-0:57:25</a>:</strong>  some of the native crops has been a big inspiration of mine lately.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:25">0:57:25-0:57:26</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:26">0:57:26-0:57:33</a>:</strong>  And gourmet coffee now is averaging some very, very high prices if you go in that direction,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:33">0:57:33-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:35">0:57:35-0:57:40</a>:</strong>  And you know, there's 602 American dollars for a pound of unprocessed coffee was the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:40">0:57:40-0:57:42</a>:</strong>  world record just set last year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:42">0:57:42-0:57:44</a>:</strong>  And where's that coming from?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:44">0:57:44-0:57:46</a>:</strong>  That's out of Colombia, I think.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:46">0:57:46-0:57:56</a>:</strong>  And there are Colombian produced small producers averaging $250 a pound unroasted because of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:56">0:57:56-0:57:58</a>:</strong>  the level and quality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:57:58">0:57:58-0:58:00</a>:</strong>  And food forest coffee is refreshing some of the highest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:00">0:58:00-0:58:03</a>:</strong>  It's always diverse coffee production.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:03">0:58:03-0:58:06</a>:</strong>  These are small producers, just like in Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:06">0:58:06-0:58:16</a>:</strong>  But for the real gourmet market, organic, of course, extremely diverse production, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:16">0:58:16-0:58:24</a>:</strong>  particular cultivars, and particular potential ways of initial process, but not roasted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:24">0:58:24-0:58:29</a>:</strong>  So I've been working with people in Colombia, students of mine on this, who have been trying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:29">0:58:29-0:58:36</a>:</strong>  to help Colombian producers to gain a better price for their product.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:36">0:58:36-0:58:38</a>:</strong>  And they've done pretty well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:38">0:58:38-0:58:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's remarkable how some of these major commodity plants around the world work so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:43">0:58:43-0:58:49</a>:</strong>  extremely well in agroforestry and polyculture systems, as they're integrated in with other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:49">0:58:49-0:58:55</a>:</strong>  species that sort of co-evolved with them, help to build soil and act towards the health<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:55">0:58:55-0:58:59</a>:</strong>  of all of the species within the system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:58:59">0:58:59-0:59:04</a>:</strong>  That's been one of our real initiatives that we are trying to push around here, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:04">0:59:04-0:59:09</a>:</strong>  in partnership with the Mesoamerican Institute of Permaculture, like you mentioned, and Atitlan<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:09">0:59:09-0:59:15</a>:</strong>  Organics, and helping to constantly observe, which obviously is one of the main traits<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:15">0:59:15-0:59:22</a>:</strong>  for a good designer, and seeing which of these interactive companion planting systems interact<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:22">0:59:22-0:59:28</a>:</strong>  well within the micro differences and the micro climates, even just being on the other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:28">0:59:28-0:59:34</a>:</strong>  side of the lake from IMAP, there are a lot of differences in our soils, there are differences<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:34">0:59:34-0:59:40</a>:</strong>  in the way that the sun touches the land throughout the day, and those can actually foster or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:40">0:59:40-0:59:45</a>:</strong>  inhibit the relationships between some of the polycultures that each one of us are working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:45">0:59:45-0:59:46</a>:</strong>  on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:46">0:59:46-0:59:48</a>:</strong>  Especially with your steep slopes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:48">0:59:48-0:59:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and extremely rocky soil where we're at too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:51">0:59:51-0:59:55</a>:</strong>  So we haven't focused so much on large cash crops because we're doing a very biointensive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=0:59:55">0:59:55-1:00:02</a>:</strong>  method on a half acre, and we're working with, especially goats right now, and one of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:02">1:00:02-1:00:09</a>:</strong>  major economic outputs or enterprises from our farm at the moment is milk, yogurt, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:09">1:00:09-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  cheese, which we all make from the goats that go around and graze freely around the landscape<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:18</a>:</strong>  here in the mountains, and they do extremely well in this climate, and with the terrain<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:18">1:00:18-1:00:23</a>:</strong>  that we have, whereas other ruminants and different animals that maybe were brought<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:23">1:00:23-1:00:26</a>:</strong>  from a different environment struggle with as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:33</a>:</strong>  So now, going on to sort of explore some of the other challenges and the limitations of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:33">1:00:33-1:00:38</a>:</strong>  moving forward, where have you both found the most success when it comes to inspiring<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:38">1:00:38-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  real change in the communities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:45</a>:</strong>  Is it things like food sovereignty, debt-free housing, I know Sam you've worked a lot with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:45">1:00:45-1:00:51</a>:</strong>  sustainable housing, perhaps reconnecting with nature, or is it something else?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:51">1:00:51-1:00:53</a>:</strong>  I think it's something tangible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:53">1:00:53-1:00:55</a>:</strong>  I think it's something real.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:55">1:00:55-1:00:59</a>:</strong>  I think it's something different to the norm and something that affects people directly,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:00:59">1:00:59-1:01:03</a>:</strong>  which is why diversity of approaches is so important, because we're a diverse world of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:03">1:01:03-1:01:05</a>:</strong>  people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:05">1:01:05-1:01:13</a>:</strong>  I think things that connect people together, a fantastic thing is Transition Towns.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:13">1:01:13-1:01:20</a>:</strong>  They're doing a lot of work and they've found that the thing that's of most benefit to people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:20">1:01:20-1:01:27</a>:</strong>  is actually, or that people have most praise for in what they've done, is that they know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:27">1:01:27-1:01:31</a>:</strong>  each other, that they know their neighbors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:31">1:01:31-1:01:39</a>:</strong>  The sorts of things that touch people at a heart level can, for a farmer, be realizing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:39">1:01:39-1:01:45</a>:</strong>  and recognizing the state of their land and that there's a situation where they don't<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:47">1:01:47-1:01:51</a>:</strong>  Reading stories about farmer suicides, these sorts of things can be the wake up that some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:51">1:01:51-1:01:58</a>:</strong>  people need, because they can see it happening so close to home.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:01:58">1:01:58-1:02:02</a>:</strong>  I think it's always movements made by real people.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:18">1:02:18-1:02:24</a>:</strong>  I think they should be called mycelial movements because it's about connection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:02:24">1:02:24-1:02:28</a>:</strong>  It's actually these movements are what support the big trees in the first place.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:21">1:03:21-1:03:27</a>:</strong>  What are the things that really hold on and take root in those communities?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:27">1:03:27-1:03:36</a>:</strong>  Health has always been a big thing that's driven people's desire to be involved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:36">1:03:36-1:03:44</a>:</strong>  It's never really gone away from the early days and it's still very much there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:44">1:03:44-1:03:49</a>:</strong>  People wanting better health and being worried about their health and seeing more evidence<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:03:56">1:03:56-1:04:05</a>:</strong>  Now we have so much more evidence about nutrient density from having well-balanced and rich<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:08">1:06:08-1:06:10</a>:</strong>  People are fast-tracking into health consciousness.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:20">1:06:20-1:06:27</a>:</strong>  One of my students from the last online course or a few online courses back is high up in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:27">1:06:27-1:06:37</a>:</strong>  Southwest Queensland Health and Hospital Department has asked me to consult for the Department<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:37">1:06:37-1:06:39</a>:</strong>  of Health.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:39">1:06:39-1:06:41</a>:</strong>  This is a large area of Southwest Queensland.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:41">1:06:41-1:06:48</a>:</strong>  It's hard to imagine, but it's probably not far off, not much smaller than the area that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:48">1:06:48-1:06:51</a>:</strong>  is the size of Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:51">1:06:51-1:06:56</a>:</strong>  Hasn't got a large population, but it has a large agricultural population and towns<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:56">1:06:56-1:06:58</a>:</strong>  that are well spread apart.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:06:58">1:06:58-1:07:09</a>:</strong>  They've realized that permaculture is a system that they could use to make their health department<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:09">1:07:09-1:07:16</a>:</strong>  efficient and concentrate on wellness to preempt illness because they just can't afford the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:16">1:07:16-1:07:23</a>:</strong>  infrastructure to be put in position for these people that are spread over remote areas of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:23">1:07:23-1:07:24</a>:</strong>  Southwest Queensland.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:24">1:07:24-1:07:26</a>:</strong>  This is not physical design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:26">1:07:26-1:07:31</a>:</strong>  This is organizational design using permaculture principles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:31">1:07:31-1:07:33</a>:</strong>  That's something very hopeful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:33">1:07:33-1:07:37</a>:</strong>  That's something very exciting and something quite unique for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:37">1:07:37-1:07:42</a>:</strong>  I've got plenty of people in my team that can help me on those sort of community consultation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:42">1:07:42-1:07:45</a>:</strong>  processes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:45">1:07:45-1:07:50</a>:</strong>  That's people thinking a completely different way about using permaculture design to create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:50">1:07:50-1:07:57</a>:</strong>  a better scenario from what at present is a failing government funded situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:57">1:07:57-1:07:58</a>:</strong>  Certainly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:58">1:07:58-1:07:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:07:59">1:07:59-1:08:05</a>:</strong>  And like you said, so many of these connections come out of when you start with the fundamental<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:05">1:08:05-1:08:12</a>:</strong>  education of recognizing patterns in nature, learning to work with energy flows and sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:12">1:08:12-1:08:15</a>:</strong>  of build resilience and fertility within the landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:15">1:08:15-1:08:22</a>:</strong>  And as you mentioned to the way the micro sort of follows the macro, the internal environment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:22">1:08:22-1:08:27</a>:</strong>  of the human body has so many similarities with that of the external world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:27">1:08:27-1:08:33</a>:</strong>  And once you get an education in these fundamentals, then it's kind of you've opened up Pandora's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:33">1:08:33-1:08:38</a>:</strong>  box and it's just a matter of learning the intricacies within the techniques that can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:38">1:08:38-1:08:43</a>:</strong>  really take these things into a higher level of functioning, whether it's food production<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:43">1:08:43-1:08:49</a>:</strong>  and like you said, fermentation and different methods of preserving or whether you go into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:49">1:08:49-1:08:50</a>:</strong>  the health aspect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:50">1:08:50-1:08:52</a>:</strong>  They're all really well connected.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:52">1:08:52-1:08:57</a>:</strong>  And within that concept, before I let you guys go, can you let all of our listeners<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:57">1:08:57-1:08:59</a>:</strong>  know how they can best contact you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:08:59">1:08:59-1:09:03</a>:</strong>  And Jeff, if you'd like to talk a little bit about some of your educational opportunities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:03">1:09:03-1:09:04</a>:</strong>  coming up as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:04">1:09:04-1:09:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:05">1:09:05-1:09:13</a>:</strong>  I'd just like to say, if I may, just to finish off there, when I go into an area, I actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:13">1:09:13-1:09:15</a>:</strong>  look at the health records of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:15">1:09:15-1:09:17</a>:</strong>  I want to know what they're dying of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:17">1:09:17-1:09:22</a>:</strong>  I want to know what their sicknesses are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:22">1:09:22-1:09:25</a>:</strong>  And I want to know how long they live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:25">1:09:25-1:09:29</a>:</strong>  So this area, Southwest Queensland, where I'm going to be doing this design for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:29">1:09:29-1:09:32</a>:</strong>  health department, people live five to 10 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:32">1:09:32-1:09:37</a>:</strong>  They die five to 10 years younger than they do in the cities of Australia and the Aboriginal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:37">1:09:37-1:09:41</a>:</strong>  community 10 to 15 years younger.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:41">1:09:41-1:09:42</a>:</strong>  And there's a reason for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:42">1:09:42-1:09:44</a>:</strong>  And you look at the health records and there it is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:44">1:09:44-1:09:49</a>:</strong>  So when you go into areas for aid, if you look at the health records, we are the guinea<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:49">1:09:49-1:09:50</a>:</strong>  pigs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:50">1:09:50-1:09:55</a>:</strong>  We can see, you can see what the morbidity figures are, what the health records are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:55">1:09:55-1:09:58</a>:</strong>  So these are things we can study.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:09:58">1:09:58-1:10:05</a>:</strong>  And what people are starting to realize is that your body doesn't just absorb insoluble<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:05">1:10:05-1:10:06</a>:</strong>  food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:06">1:10:06-1:10:10</a>:</strong>  It's transferred through the organisms in your gut if it's real food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:10">1:10:10-1:10:18</a>:</strong>  Now you can take refined foods in like soluble fertilizer is soaked in through the roots<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:18">1:10:18-1:10:21</a>:</strong>  of plants because they have to drink.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:21">1:10:21-1:10:26</a>:</strong>  You are forced, I mean, you can't help but absorb such processed foods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:26">1:10:26-1:10:29</a>:</strong>  And this is where obesity comes from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:29">1:10:29-1:10:33</a>:</strong>  And now it's becoming very, very obvious that healthy gut organisms are the ones that do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:33">1:10:33-1:10:35</a>:</strong>  the transactions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:35">1:10:35-1:10:40</a>:</strong>  And we have to keep them alive like it's an internal ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:40">1:10:40-1:10:43</a>:</strong>  So it is important for your listeners to realize this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:43">1:10:43-1:10:46</a>:</strong>  I mean, it's not rocket science.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:46">1:10:46-1:10:47</a>:</strong>  It's not simple, though.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:47">1:10:47-1:10:54</a>:</strong>  And it's an interesting complexity that you can really benefit from starting to develop<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:54">1:10:54-1:10:55</a>:</strong>  an understanding for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:55">1:10:55-1:10:59</a>:</strong>  So I'm sure I'd speak for Sam here as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-geoff-and-sam/#t=1:10:59">1:10:59-1:11:08</a>:</strong>  Our main concern is creating healthy people so we can all create a healthy planet.<br />
