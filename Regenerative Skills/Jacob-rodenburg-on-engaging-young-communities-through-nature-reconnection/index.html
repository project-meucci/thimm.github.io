<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:11">0:15:11-0:15:14</a>:</strong>  Because if you think about it, when you're hunched over a computer screen, everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:14">0:15:14-0:15:19</a>:</strong>  squeezed into two dimensions, hermetically sealed, you're only activating your sense<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:19">0:15:19-0:15:24</a>:</strong>  of sight and your sense of hearing, but those other senses are missing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:24">0:15:24-0:15:28</a>:</strong>  In fact, some people have called it sensory anesthesia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:28">0:15:28-0:15:34</a>:</strong>  That our senses are designed to connect us fulsomely to the natural world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:34">0:15:34-0:15:40</a>:</strong>  And I believe that if kids aren't activating their senses, if they're not in nature, they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:40">0:15:40-0:15:44</a>:</strong>  missing a piece, a feeling of belonging to something bigger.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:44">0:15:44-0:15:48</a>:</strong>  And maybe that's contributing to a sense of loneliness they have, because they don't feel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:48">0:15:48-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  like they're part of the life systems that nourish us all.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:15:58">0:15:58-0:15:59</a>:</strong>  and sniff.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:03">0:16:03-0:16:07</a>:</strong>  the different evergreen needles from pine, to fir, to spruce, and just picking up those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:07">0:16:07-0:16:08</a>:</strong>  different aromas.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:13">0:16:13-0:16:20</a>:</strong>  of pine needles and fir needles, a bit of grass, and we create these little smell cocktails<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:30</a>:</strong>  the other hand the other way, you're isolating a piece of nature and you're looking at it<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:37">0:16:37-0:16:41</a>:</strong>  it up somewhere and get a beautiful view of nature.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:16:57">0:16:57-0:17:02</a>:</strong>  pine or the chattering of an aspen.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:05">0:17:05-0:17:11</a>:</strong>  I remember once taking my kids to this beautiful overlook.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:11">0:17:11-0:17:14</a>:</strong>  We hiked, oh, it must have been an hour to get to the top.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:14">0:17:14-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  I was sweating and I was taking it all in, you know, lakes sparkling in the distance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:23</a>:</strong>  I could see the tops of trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:23">0:17:23-0:17:26</a>:</strong>  And my kids were hiked down looking at ants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:26">0:17:26-0:17:31</a>:</strong>  And that's because, especially kids, smaller kids have a contracted view of the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:31">0:17:31-0:17:35</a>:</strong>  But if you can harness that, create little micro trails.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:35">0:17:35-0:17:39</a>:</strong>  So you take a popsicle stick and you poke it down in something that's interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:39">0:17:39-0:17:42</a>:</strong>  So it might be next to a chewed leaf.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  Just paying attention to the very small.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:11">0:18:11-0:18:14</a>:</strong>  Or maybe you want to see an earth boring submarine?<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:20</a>:</strong>  The shape shifter is a little pill bug that curls up into a ball.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:24">0:21:24-0:21:29</a>:</strong>  And we define stewardship as someone who cares for each other and cares for the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:29">0:21:29-0:21:34</a>:</strong>  So little kids, really, it is focusing on sensory awareness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:34">0:21:34-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  But as kids get older, it's almost like ever widening fields of self.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:43</a>:</strong>  When you're younger, you're focused more on your own needs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:43">0:21:43-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  But as you get older, you recognize you're part of the society.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  And then as you get older, yet you recognize you're part of the bigger world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:55</a>:</strong>  And it's finding those activities that are age appropriate through each age and stage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:55">0:21:55-0:21:56</a>:</strong>  of a child's development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:21:56">0:21:56-0:22:01</a>:</strong>  So yeah, middle aged kids love to explore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:01">0:22:01-0:22:08</a>:</strong>  So if you're eight, nine, ten, that's a very evocative age and children are curious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:08">0:22:08-0:22:15</a>:</strong>  And part of the way as a parent or an educator, you could help to spur that curiosity on is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:15">0:22:15-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  something I called hosing the leaf.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  So you ask every child to grab a leaf and hold it in their hands and stand next to a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  partner who also is holding a leaf.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  And you say, I don't know if you ever heard of Sherlock Holmes, but Watson, who was Sherlock<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:31">0:22:31-0:22:35</a>:</strong>  Holmes' sidekick, would always say, Watson, how is it you figure it out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:35">0:22:35-0:22:37</a>:</strong>  The answers to those mysteries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:37">0:22:37-0:22:44</a>:</strong>  And Holmes would say, my dear Watson, you see, but you do not notice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:44">0:22:44-0:22:49</a>:</strong>  So then in the spirit of Sherlock Holmes, each person looks at their leaf and they start<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:49">0:22:49-0:22:52</a>:</strong>  with a statement, I noticed that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:52">0:22:52-0:22:56</a>:</strong>  I noticed that this leaf is different colors on both sides.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:22:56">0:22:56-0:23:00</a>:</strong>  I noticed that this leaf has more pronounced veins on the back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:00">0:23:00-0:23:04</a>:</strong>  I noticed that the leaf has pointy edges or an insect's been chewing it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:04">0:23:04-0:23:05</a>:</strong>  What do you notice?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:05">0:23:05-0:23:12</a>:</strong>  And the next thing after that is, I wonder, I wonder why this leaf is green.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:12">0:23:12-0:23:14</a>:</strong>  I wonder why it fell off the tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:14">0:23:14-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  I wonder what insect ate this leaf.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:21</a>:</strong>  And really, if you think of the engine of learning is curiosity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:21">0:23:21-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  So as a parent, as an educator, if we can harness that curiosity and really help kids<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  to ask those wonder questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:36</a>:</strong>  At the very end of this exercise, you can also say, huh, it reminds me of, well, this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:36">0:23:36-0:23:42</a>:</strong>  leaf reminds me of the fact that spring is coming and new leaves will be forming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:42">0:23:42-0:23:48</a>:</strong>  This leaf reminds me that, well, eventually it'll fall into the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:48">0:23:48-0:23:50</a>:</strong>  It'll decompose and help other things to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:50">0:23:50-0:23:58</a>:</strong>  So that sequence from observing to wondering to thinking about relationships really helps<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:23:58">0:23:58-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  kids feel more connected to the natural world around them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:07</a>:</strong>  I love that because one of the things that I often talk about on this show is the process<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:07">0:24:07-0:24:11</a>:</strong>  of observation of nature and learning how to read a landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:11">0:24:11-0:24:14</a>:</strong>  And it can be hard to develop those skills if you don't have much reference or training<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:14">0:24:14-0:24:17</a>:</strong>  from doing it when you were younger.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:17">0:24:17-0:24:22</a>:</strong>  And in developing this observational skill, it's almost exercising like a muscle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:22">0:24:22-0:24:28</a>:</strong>  It trains your eyes to notice things and distinguish different life forms, different stages of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:28">0:24:28-0:24:32</a>:</strong>  development, different interaction patterns.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:39">0:24:39-0:24:42</a>:</strong>  from the environment around you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:42">0:24:42-0:24:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:44">0:24:44-0:24:50</a>:</strong>  And those wonder questions and those curiosity questions are so important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:50">0:24:50-0:24:54</a>:</strong>  And as parents and as educators, we can either shut it down or we can encourage it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:54">0:24:54-0:24:57</a>:</strong>  So often I've heard a parent say, oh, Johnny, put that down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:57">0:24:57-0:24:58</a>:</strong>  That's gross.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:24:58">0:24:58-0:25:00</a>:</strong>  A spider, yuck.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:04">0:25:04-0:25:05</a>:</strong>  Huh?<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:14">0:25:14-0:25:17</a>:</strong>  that kid is feeling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:17">0:25:17-0:25:19</a>:</strong>  The more that you can spur that on and encourage it, the better.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:22">0:25:22-0:25:24</a>:</strong>  And you don't need to know the answers to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:24">0:25:24-0:25:27</a>:</strong>  You just need to make the effort to find out more.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:37">0:25:37-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  very encyclopedic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:39">0:25:39-0:25:42</a>:</strong>  You'd walk around and you say, oh, yeah, I'll look at that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:42">0:25:42-0:25:45</a>:</strong>  It's an elm tree and over here, yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:45">0:25:45-0:25:47</a>:</strong>  So they'd be labeling.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:47">0:25:47-0:25:49</a>:</strong>  But that's not the way our brains work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:25:49">0:25:49-0:25:51</a>:</strong>  Our brains are designed to listen to stories.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:09</a>:</strong>  It's wood is rot resistant.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:16</a>:</strong>  You know, you can make a tea because it's rich in vitamin C. So dive more deeply find<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:16">0:26:16-0:26:20</a>:</strong>  out the story, the character of that particular thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:20">0:26:20-0:26:22</a>:</strong>  Which brings me to another point, too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:22">0:26:22-0:26:28</a>:</strong>  And that is the tendency of all of us to really think of nature as a resource that only exists<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:28">0:26:28-0:26:34</a>:</strong>  for human consumption, instead of, you know, thinking about it as a living entity that<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:41">0:26:41-0:26:47</a>:</strong>  So my wife, Jessica, who runs a Waldorf based school, she's really good at that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:47">0:26:47-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  So the kids will go out to, let's say, Grandfather Rock, or Heart Tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:26:57</a>:</strong>  And by using these names, she begins to give the land personality and imbue it with a bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:26:57">0:26:57-0:26:59</a>:</strong>  of spirit.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:32</a>:</strong>  Intimacy of going over and over again, of practicing reciprocity and gratitude and thanks.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:34">0:38:34-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  I just have to give kids the chance to explore.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:43">0:38:43-0:38:47</a>:</strong>  Six sides, I'll put all the six directions on one block.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  And we'll roll the dice and I'll say, okay, northwest 24.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:39:02</a>:</strong>  So we'll all turn northwest and we'll take 24 paces and then we'll hunker down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:02">0:39:02-0:39:05</a>:</strong>  And at our feet, we'll discover something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:39:05">0:39:05-0:39:06</a>:</strong>  It might be a spider's web.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:14">0:42:14-0:42:19</a>:</strong>  nature can share the same spot so that both can thrive.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:32">0:42:32-0:42:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so we're working on the Pathways to Stewardship program where we have over 40<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:39">0:42:39-0:42:44</a>:</strong>  organizations involved, the university, the college, and we're trying to make sure that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:44">0:42:44-0:42:49</a>:</strong>  kids get those important stewardship experiences throughout their development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:49">0:42:49-0:42:53</a>:</strong>  I think that's a model that we're sharing to other jurisdictions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:42:53">0:42:53-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  We're also doing Eco-Mentor programming.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:05">0:43:05-0:43:09</a>:</strong>  outside in their school yard and what activities they can do there that are consistent with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:09">0:43:09-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  the curriculum that will help kids connect to nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  And just recently, this model has gone national online.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  So we're able to reach faculties of education across Canada.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:26</a>:</strong>  And we're also working with early childhood educators.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:26">0:43:26-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  But really, I think we need to build and live in a new way, which brings nature back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:38</a>:</strong>  That excites me, the whole idea of being regenerative, of doing more good than harm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:38">0:43:38-0:43:44</a>:</strong>  And if I have a role to play in helping with that, I'd be very happy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:44">0:43:44-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  That concept, that idea really resonates with me as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:51</a>:</strong>  It's part of what this podcast is based around aiming to do.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  generation so that they can take on the work that is going to be otherwise very insurmountable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:03">0:44:03-0:44:05</a>:</strong>  without their help.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:08">0:44:08-0:44:11</a>:</strong>  What are some of the biggest challenges that you're working to overcome in that regard?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:11">0:44:11-0:44:16</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I think it's just the sheer amount of time the kids are spending inside in front<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:16">0:44:16-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  of computers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:19</a>:</strong>  And I'm not dissing computers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:19">0:44:19-0:44:25</a>:</strong>  They're a valuable tool, but like any tool, you need to learn to use it properly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:25">0:44:25-0:44:32</a>:</strong>  So the easiest way to counteract that is to help teachers and parents recognize the value<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:32">0:44:32-0:44:36</a>:</strong>  of being outdoors, connecting with nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:36">0:44:36-0:44:41</a>:</strong>  And if we can train parents and educators to be the gatekeepers, to open up the doors<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:41">0:44:41-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  to nature and to bring nature inside, I think that will go a long way to helping kids care<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  for this earth that we all share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:44:53</a>:</strong>  Amazing and I feel like I had cut you off there just before I asked this last question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:53">0:44:53-0:44:55</a>:</strong>  Was there something else that you wanted to say?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:44:55">0:44:55-0:45:01</a>:</strong>  Oh, I was just thinking about the idea of agency, empowerment and hope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:01">0:45:01-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  And that is you don't want to give a kid a problem they don't have the ability to solve<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:08</a>:</strong>  for the aids that they're at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:08">0:45:08-0:45:14</a>:</strong>  In fact, everything you do hopefully inspires kids to want to do more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:14">0:45:14-0:45:22</a>:</strong>  So think carefully before you start talking about climate change and how dire that all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:23</a>:</strong>  is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:23">0:45:23-0:45:29</a>:</strong>  Instead, it starts with developing a close and intimate relationship with nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:29">0:45:29-0:45:34</a>:</strong>  And really climate change is a symptom of our broken relationship to nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:34">0:45:34-0:45:39</a>:</strong>  We're doing what we're doing to the earth because we really have not had a good relationship<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:45:49</a>:</strong>  We wouldn't be doing these things if we had a fulsome connection to nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:49">0:45:49-0:45:50</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:50">0:45:50-0:45:56</a>:</strong>  And look, Jacob, I feel like there are still a lot of things that you're touching on here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:56">0:45:56-0:45:59</a>:</strong>  that we could explore for a long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:45:59">0:45:59-0:46:05</a>:</strong>  But how can others get in touch with you and learn more about the programs and this pathway<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/jacob-rodenburg-on-engaging-young-communities-through-nature-reconnection/#t=0:46:05">0:46:05-0:46:08</a>:</strong>  to stewardship and kinship program especially?<br />
