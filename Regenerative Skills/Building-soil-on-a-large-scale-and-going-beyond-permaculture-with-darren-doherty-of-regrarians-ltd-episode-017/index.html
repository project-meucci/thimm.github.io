<p><strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:04</a>:</strong>  Hello and welcome to this episode of The Abundant Edge, the podcast all about the worlds of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:04">0:00:04-0:00:07</a>:</strong>  natural building, permaculture, and regenerative living.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:07">0:00:07-0:00:12</a>:</strong>  I'm your host Oliver Gautier and I have a fantastic interview for you today, so let's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:12">0:00:12-0:00:13</a>:</strong>  jump right on in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:13">0:00:13-0:00:26</a>:</strong>  Now my interview today is with one of the designers and changemakers that has most influenced<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:26">0:00:26-0:00:31</a>:</strong>  my own approach to professional projects and regenerative landscape development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:31">0:00:31-0:00:37</a>:</strong>  Darren Doherty is the founder of Regrarian's LTD based in Bendigo, Australia, and he has<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:37">0:00:37-0:00:42</a>:</strong>  extensive experience in project design, development, management, and training.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:42">0:00:42-0:00:47</a>:</strong>  He's worked in six continents and nearly 50 countries in mostly broad-acre agricultural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:47">0:00:47-0:00:49</a>:</strong>  applications.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:49">0:00:49-0:00:53</a>:</strong>  The Regrarian's purpose that he promotes through his business is to provide the potential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:53">0:00:53-0:00:59</a>:</strong>  for people to be informed about the regenerative economy, whether it involves work in agriculture,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:00:59">0:00:59-0:01:04</a>:</strong>  land management, corporate life, domestic services, manufacturing, or other activities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:04">0:01:04-0:01:07</a>:</strong>  that are within the reasonable domain of humans.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:07">0:01:07-0:01:11</a>:</strong>  In this episode, Darren talks extensively about the innovative platform and ethics that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:11">0:01:11-0:01:16</a>:</strong>  his organization promotes, how he got started as a landscape designer and began teaching<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:16">0:01:16-0:01:21</a>:</strong>  with Bill Mollison, the co-founder of permaculture, and he gives essential advice on how to build<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:21">0:01:21-0:01:26</a>:</strong>  soils that are a little counterintuitive to how many people have learned with mulch and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:26">0:01:26-0:01:27</a>:</strong>  compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:27">0:01:27-0:01:31</a>:</strong>  This is another really in-depth interview and I'd advise having a notebook on hand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:31">0:01:31-0:01:35</a>:</strong>  as Darren goes into detail about a lot of the science behind soil building and carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:35">0:01:35-0:01:39</a>:</strong>  sequestering in a regenerative landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:39">0:01:39-0:01:43</a>:</strong>  Just a quick disclaimer before we get started, I recorded this episode on Mother's Day<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:43">0:01:43-0:01:48</a>:</strong>  here in a little town of Sununah in Guatemala where I'm at at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:48">0:01:48-0:01:52</a>:</strong>  The town held a big concert in the square right next to where I live and the music started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:52">0:01:52-0:01:54</a>:</strong>  right as Darren and I got started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:54">0:01:54-0:01:59</a>:</strong>  I did my best to edit all of the music and the noise, but just bear with me if at some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:01:59">0:01:59-0:02:02</a>:</strong>  point some of the music gets through and it is just a little bit distracting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:02">0:02:02-0:02:07</a>:</strong>  Darren and I have a good laugh about the whole thing at the end of the interview and it all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:07">0:02:07-0:02:08</a>:</strong>  went pretty well considering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:08">0:02:08-0:02:12</a>:</strong>  Just before we get started, don't forget to tune in at the end of this episode for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:15</a>:</strong>  some exclusive information on upcoming workshops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:15">0:02:15-0:02:18</a>:</strong>  Now here's Darren Doherty from Regrarians LTD.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:18">0:02:18-0:02:22</a>:</strong>  Hey Darren, thank you so much for being with me today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:22">0:02:22-0:02:23</a>:</strong>  How are you doing down there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:23">0:02:23-0:02:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I'm really well thanks Oliver, really nice to talk to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:27">0:02:27-0:02:28</a>:</strong>  Hey, it's totally my pleasure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:28">0:02:28-0:02:32</a>:</strong>  Well, I've got a ton of questions that I would love to ask you and my listeners would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:32">0:02:32-0:02:35</a>:</strong>  love to hear from as well, so why don't we just jump right on in?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:35">0:02:35-0:02:36</a>:</strong>  Sounds great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:36">0:02:36-0:02:39</a>:</strong>  Alright, so let's start at the beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:39">0:02:39-0:02:42</a>:</strong>  Let's start by talking a little bit about your background and how you got into the work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:42">0:02:42-0:02:46</a>:</strong>  that you do now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:46">0:02:46-0:02:52</a>:</strong>  My background is probably a bit different to what a lot of people is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:52">0:02:52-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  It really starts with my father being killed in Vietnam when I'm three or four months<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:08</a>:</strong>  old and at the time my 21 year old mother and I were living at her parents' farm,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:08">0:03:08-0:03:11</a>:</strong>  my maternal grandparents.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:11">0:03:11-0:03:19</a>:</strong>  And that wasn't expected of course and as a result my grandfather who was in his early<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:19">0:03:19-0:03:29</a>:</strong>  50s at the time and my grandmother who was only 44 took us on as it were and with that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:29">0:03:29-0:03:35</a>:</strong>  granddad effectively became, and Nana, but particularly granddad out in the field became<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:35">0:03:35-0:03:45</a>:</strong>  this rural mentor, so I probably would have been straight into suburbia had my father<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:45">0:03:45-0:03:51</a>:</strong>  lived and so I started really there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:51">0:03:51-0:03:56</a>:</strong>  So we spent the first few years of my life there and then because of that bond with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:04:03</a>:</strong>  place and my Nana and granddad when my mother remarried and we did move into town with her<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:03">0:04:03-0:04:09</a>:</strong>  new husband, my stepfather, my dad, I'd go out there all the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:09">0:04:09-0:04:18</a>:</strong>  I was out there every holidays, a lot of weekends as labor and willingly because I loved it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:18">0:04:18-0:04:19</a>:</strong>  out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:19">0:04:19-0:04:27</a>:</strong>  I saw it as being my real home and I helped my grandfather right up until they sold the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:27">0:04:27-0:04:35</a>:</strong>  place which was about 1998 I think.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:35">0:04:35-0:04:38</a>:</strong>  And yeah, so it really started there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:38">0:04:38-0:04:49</a>:</strong>  After that I, when I was about 18 I left school and got involved in hospitality as a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:49">0:04:49-0:04:55</a>:</strong>  people do at that age, especially those who don't go and go to university as I never did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:04:55">0:04:55-0:05:01</a>:</strong>  And I got involved in the food and it was really food that started to really jump out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:01">0:05:01-0:05:09</a>:</strong>  at me and I got involved in hospitality initially as a waiter and then I became a chef and really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:09">0:05:09-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  got engaged with food and local food particularly when I was working in Tasmania.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:23</a>:</strong>  I was talking with a very young executive chef in a five-star international hotel and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:23">0:05:23-0:05:29</a>:</strong>  he was only 28 and he was, we had a lot of providores coming in and farmers coming to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:29">0:05:29-0:05:36</a>:</strong>  the back door with the product and very innovative products and that and a few of the young chefs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:36">0:05:36-0:05:40</a>:</strong>  that I was working with otherwise, you know, were really interested in the farming and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:43</a>:</strong>  how the story of the food and et cetera.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:43">0:05:43-0:05:49</a>:</strong>  So my farming background brought me back into that and it wasn't that long before I left<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:49">0:05:49-0:05:57</a>:</strong>  hospitality probably and I got a job and I wanted to get out anyway because of the schedule<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:05:57">0:05:57-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  of hospitality is always, you're always working while the people are eating and then cleaning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:04</a>:</strong>  up after.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:04">0:06:04-0:06:05</a>:</strong>  I know that, I've done plenty of that work as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:05">0:06:05-0:06:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, yeah, as a lot of people have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:07">0:06:07-0:06:11</a>:</strong>  It's just, it's a, you know, it's a stay in it over the duration of hats off to people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:11">0:06:11-0:06:12</a>:</strong>  who do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:12">0:06:12-0:06:22</a>:</strong>  But I got a job, I moved back home to Bédigo and I was working about an hour away and it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:22">0:06:22-0:06:28</a>:</strong>  was a really hard job to get to and I didn't have accommodation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:28">0:06:28-0:06:36</a>:</strong>  It was just tough and I started going to the local organic shop and organic grocery and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:36">0:06:36-0:06:44</a>:</strong>  struck up a friendship as you do with the shopkeepers and got in and we started talking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:44">0:06:44-0:06:46</a>:</strong>  and they said, oh, we need someone to manage the place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:46">0:06:46-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  So I took on that job, which was great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:57</a>:</strong>  And that put me in really good contact with a whole host of growers and here in central<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:06:57">0:06:57-0:07:04</a>:</strong>  Victoria, it's one of the epicentres of organic agriculture on the planet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:04">0:07:04-0:07:13</a>:</strong>  And so I was, this is nearly 30 years ago, I was in contact with a whole host of really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:13">0:07:13-0:07:23</a>:</strong>  innovative growers and producers and processes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:23">0:07:23-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  And it sort of started my consulting career, if you like, started by me answering their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:37</a>:</strong>  questions of, because they'd say, what's this guy over here doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:37">0:07:37-0:07:42</a>:</strong>  I heard, you know, Oliver, what is, what's he doing about growing his carrots or growing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:42">0:07:42-0:07:45</a>:</strong>  his potatoes or looking after his cattle?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:45">0:07:45-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  And I'd answer, I'd say, oh, Oliver's doing this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:54</a>:</strong>  And so it's sort of, my job really hasn't changed that much since then because so much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:54">0:07:54-0:07:59</a>:</strong>  of what I do now is saying, all right, well, I've got a client who'll say, oh, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:07:59">0:07:59-0:08:00</a>:</strong>  I've got this particular problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:00">0:08:00-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  Well, I'll say, well, Oliver over here, he's doing this and Ben over here is doing this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:08</a>:</strong>  and Megan over here is doing this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:08">0:08:08-0:08:09</a>:</strong>  Maybe you want to talk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:09">0:08:09-0:08:13</a>:</strong>  So it really did start at the shop counter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:13">0:08:13-0:08:18</a>:</strong>  And it has been really a form of hospitality the whole way through as often.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:18">0:08:18-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  So let me see if I understand this correctly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:26</a>:</strong>  Because of your middleman position, communicating with all these different growers and producers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:26">0:08:26-0:08:29</a>:</strong>  they came to you asking advice based on what you've heard from others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:29">0:08:29-0:08:33</a>:</strong>  And that's how you got started in consulting?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:33">0:08:33-0:08:36</a>:</strong>  And how did it turn into a full-time job for you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:36">0:08:36-0:08:45</a>:</strong>  And when did that transition turn into the Regrarians platform that you use now?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:45">0:08:45-0:08:53</a>:</strong>  The transition occurred when I had a few people who were what you might class as homesteaders.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:53">0:08:53-0:08:57</a>:</strong>  We call them blockies or hobby farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:08:57">0:08:57-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  People with small acreages around Bendigo, the peri-urban type folks who were customers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:06</a>:</strong>  of ours at the shop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:06">0:09:06-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  And I can remember one said, oh, can you maybe you can come out and help me with my place,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:17</a>:</strong>  show me where I should put things or set up my garden and that sort of thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:17">0:09:17-0:09:21</a>:</strong>  So it sort of just started there while I was still working at the shop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:21">0:09:21-0:09:23</a>:</strong>  And it just sort of grew from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:23">0:09:23-0:09:34</a>:</strong>  And Lisa and I, my wife, who I met at the shop, we started talking about it and just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:34">0:09:34-0:09:36</a>:</strong>  one thing led to another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:36">0:09:36-0:09:44</a>:</strong>  So I did a business plan training course, which was for six weeks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:44">0:09:44-0:09:49</a>:</strong>  And that gave me the opportunity to do a whole business plan on some of the idea of setting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:49">0:09:49-0:09:52</a>:</strong>  up a land planning consultancy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:52">0:09:52-0:09:55</a>:</strong>  And so we did that and I succeeded in that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:09:55">0:09:55-0:10:01</a>:</strong>  And that gave us at the end a year long subsidy, which was equivalent to the unemployment benefit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:01">0:10:01-0:10:03</a>:</strong>  of the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:03">0:10:03-0:10:09</a>:</strong>  And so that was really great start to our first year of business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:09">0:10:09-0:10:12</a>:</strong>  And in that year, I did some different trainings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:12">0:10:12-0:10:18</a>:</strong>  I did a key line training, which I'd already been OK with because we'd done a lot of key<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:18">0:10:18-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  line work on our farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:24</a>:</strong>  And I've seen a lot of farmers in the district who'd used key line.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:24">0:10:24-0:10:32</a>:</strong>  And then I also did a permaculture design course later in the year, which also brought<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:32">0:10:32-0:10:33</a>:</strong>  a lot of things together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:33">0:10:33-0:10:36</a>:</strong>  And so off we went.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:36">0:10:36-0:10:43</a>:</strong>  And in order to keep the cash flowing, because cash flow is king, it always is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:43">0:10:43-0:10:49</a>:</strong>  It doesn't matter when you are in your business or where you are in your business life, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:49">0:10:49-0:10:51</a>:</strong>  certainly when you're starting off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:51">0:10:51-0:10:57</a>:</strong>  And it seemed to me that when I was young, I was only 24 or something like that, had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:10:57">0:10:57-0:11:02</a>:</strong>  a lot more energy than I have now, although I still can feel the energetic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:02">0:11:02-0:11:09</a>:</strong>  That I wanted to really go out and develop the designs that I was coming up with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:09">0:11:09-0:11:15</a>:</strong>  And that was attractive to our clientele to say, all right, well, here's someone who can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:15">0:11:15-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  not only design your place, but can come out and do the installation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:23</a>:</strong>  And so that was really good because it meant if I was just the designer, then I only got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:23">0:11:23-0:11:24</a>:</strong>  design income.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:24">0:11:24-0:11:31</a>:</strong>  And that might be 10 jobs a year, for example, in 1993.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:31">0:11:31-0:11:38</a>:</strong>  Whereas if you've got 10 jobs a year and you're doing the install, that starts to be a business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:38">0:11:38-0:11:41</a>:</strong>  that you can get by with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:41">0:11:41-0:11:44</a>:</strong>  And so it sort of grew from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:11:52</a>:</strong>  And so over time, we got up to about 100, 150 designs a year, probably about 30% of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:52">0:11:52-0:11:56</a>:</strong>  those being installed with the whole team and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:11:56">0:11:56-0:12:02</a>:</strong>  And that took us right up until the end of that decade, the 90s and into the noughties.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:02">0:12:02-0:12:07</a>:</strong>  And then I've done a few more trainings over time and struck up a friendship with Bill<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:07">0:12:07-0:12:12</a>:</strong>  Mollison, the permaculture co-founder or co-originator.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:12">0:12:12-0:12:18</a>:</strong>  And Bill said to me in about 1999, he said, oh, it's about time you started to teach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:18">0:12:18-0:12:24</a>:</strong>  And so he invited me to come and co-teach a PD, a permaculture design course with him<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:24">0:12:24-0:12:27</a>:</strong>  in Tasmania.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:27">0:12:27-0:12:29</a>:</strong>  And I was down there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:29">0:12:29-0:12:35</a>:</strong>  So I went down and did a couple of those with him and that sort of showed to us and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:35">0:12:35-0:12:44</a>:</strong>  feedback that I got from the various crowds there that I had some skill in that area as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:44">0:12:44-0:12:45</a>:</strong>  a trainer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:45">0:12:45-0:12:55</a>:</strong>  And so we did that and then I got a job working overseas with Mars Incorporated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:12:55">0:12:55-0:13:03</a>:</strong>  So that was just a straight first time I really had one client who I worked with and nobody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:03">0:13:03-0:13:04</a>:</strong>  else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:04">0:13:04-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  And we worked with them for three years and we moved to Vietnam, hence my sympathy with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:14</a>:</strong>  some of your background noise of living in a rural village.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:14">0:13:14-0:13:16</a>:</strong>  I actually spent a lot of time in Vietnam as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:16">0:13:16-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  I know how it can be over there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:19</a>:</strong>  It's a beautiful country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:19">0:13:19-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  It is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  You said you were there for three years?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, which was really important to – I mean, it was the first overseas job<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:28">0:13:28-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  I got and it was kind of poignant that my father was lost there and I'd sort of – as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:40</a>:</strong>  you would imagine, I always had a fascination for the place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:40">0:13:40-0:13:47</a>:</strong>  And so there was a lot of catharsis in working there and embedding ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:49</a>:</strong>  Like our whole family moved there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:49">0:13:49-0:13:55</a>:</strong>  So we had some pretty young kids at that stage, so three young kids.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:13:55">0:13:55-0:14:03</a>:</strong>  So that was pretty good because that was both a training and I was training trainers and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:03">0:14:03-0:14:09</a>:</strong>  I was doing the design and development for Mars Incorporated, the big food company, private<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:09">0:14:09-0:14:12</a>:</strong>  food company.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:12">0:14:12-0:14:23</a>:</strong>  So we did that and that really consolidated this – the training to what we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:23">0:14:23-0:14:29</a>:</strong>  And then we say – I talked to Alan Yeomans, P.A. Yeomans' son.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:29">0:14:29-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  We've had Yeomans' plough since 1994, so I've been mates with him for a long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:37</a>:</strong>  And I was talking to him and he said, I've got my latest book coming out and that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:37">0:14:37-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  about global warming and blah, blah, blah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:40">0:14:40-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  So we talked and he showed me that a 1.6 percent increase in soil carbon in the top 30 centimetres<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  or foot of topsoil on the world's 5 billion hectares of agricultural land, if we were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:15:04</a>:</strong>  to get that increase in soil carbon by 1.6 percent, then that would download 100 parts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:04">0:15:04-0:15:06</a>:</strong>  per million of CO2 out of the atmosphere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:06">0:15:06-0:15:09</a>:</strong>  And I went, wow, that's pretty amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:09">0:15:09-0:15:13</a>:</strong>  And he was the first person to come up with that and he wrote about it in his book, Priority<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:13">0:15:13-0:15:18</a>:</strong>  1, How Together We Can Save the World from Global Warming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:18">0:15:18-0:15:23</a>:</strong>  And Lisa and I had saved up about 50 or 60 grand to build a house on our small farm and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:23">0:15:23-0:15:29</a>:</strong>  we went, you know what, we couldn't have this information and not talk about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:29">0:15:29-0:15:37</a>:</strong>  So we designed a world tour, bought five sets of round world tickets and did the world's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:37">0:15:37-0:15:39</a>:</strong>  first carbon farming tour.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:39">0:15:39-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  It was called the Soil, Water and Carbon for Every Farm Tour in 2007.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:50</a>:</strong>  And it was based around, we did mainly keyline courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:50">0:15:50-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  Anyway, we carried on with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  We did that work, we did a 13 month tour from February to April of 2007, 2008.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:04</a>:</strong>  And then we followed that up in 2009.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:04">0:16:04-0:16:10</a>:</strong>  And while we were doing that, I got invited by all of Australia's holistic management<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:10">0:16:10-0:16:12</a>:</strong>  educators.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:12">0:16:12-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  I think with the exception of one or two, they'd all got together and they'd said, well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:20</a>:</strong>  our weak link is land planning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:20">0:16:20-0:16:23</a>:</strong>  So they invited me to come and teach them land planning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:23">0:16:23-0:16:29</a>:</strong>  And when I was preparing for that, one of these holistic management educators also taught<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:29">0:16:29-0:16:32</a>:</strong>  keyline at a community college.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:32">0:16:32-0:16:34</a>:</strong>  And I said to him, so how do you teach keyline?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:34">0:16:34-0:16:39</a>:</strong>  He said, I use the keyline scale of permanence, which I'd always in my keyline trainings always<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:39">0:16:39-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  talked about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:45</a>:</strong>  And of course, because it's a really big part of keyline.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:45">0:16:45-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  But I went, really?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:49</a>:</strong>  And he goes, I said, so how?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:49">0:16:49-0:16:55</a>:</strong>  And he said, well, I started climate and I go through and I do land shape, I do water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:55">0:16:55-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  and blah, blah, blah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:16:58</a>:</strong>  And I went, blow me down with a feather.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:16:58">0:16:58-0:17:04</a>:</strong>  You know, it was one of those moments where something had been there in front of you the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:04">0:17:04-0:17:05</a>:</strong>  whole time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:05">0:17:05-0:17:12</a>:</strong>  Because go back to 1998, I think it was Bill Mollison asked me to write a book and he said,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:12">0:17:12-0:17:18</a>:</strong>  I want you guys are really good at process because we were handling lots of clients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:18">0:17:18-0:17:22</a>:</strong>  And I had, I templated everything I read.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:22">0:17:22-0:17:28</a>:</strong>  I was an early reader of Michael Gerber's, the entrepreneurial myth, the E-myth, where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:28">0:17:28-0:17:30</a>:</strong>  you try to systemize everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:30">0:17:30-0:17:37</a>:</strong>  So I had all of those systems, but and I had what I called our works pattern.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:37">0:17:37-0:17:44</a>:</strong>  You know, there was the client came in, you interviewed them, you did your side analysis,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:44">0:17:44-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  you did your concept plan, your feedback, detail planning, got all your costings and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:52</a>:</strong>  approvals, did the job and then you had management over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:52">0:17:52-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  That was our sort of pattern.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:54">0:17:54-0:17:56</a>:</strong>  And we worked along that basis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:17:56">0:17:56-0:18:01</a>:</strong>  But that didn't necessarily work well for training, especially something like Keyline,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:03</a>:</strong>  it wasn't inclusive enough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:03">0:18:03-0:18:09</a>:</strong>  And so when the Keyline Scale of Terminates was put before me, I immediately changed over<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:09">0:18:09-0:18:10</a>:</strong>  to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:10">0:18:10-0:18:22</a>:</strong>  Now, can you explain to me what does the term of R<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:22">0:18:22-0:18:23</a>:</strong>  agrarian mean and the platform and ethics that you promote that goes along with it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  Well, agrarian was a word that I came up with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:32</a>:</strong>  The term region agrarian, well, a friend of mine, Ed Collins, came up with the term in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:32">0:18:32-0:18:35</a>:</strong>  a letter, but it was regen and agrarian separately.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:35">0:18:35-0:18:43</a>:</strong>  And then I was branding, I was playing around and that sort of re-came to me in a sort of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:43">0:18:43-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  in some moments with some other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  And anyway, we did that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:18:52</a>:</strong>  And then I left that brand to those that I was working with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:52">0:18:52-0:18:55</a>:</strong>  And we needed something that really defined us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:18:55">0:18:55-0:19:00</a>:</strong>  And so as you do, I was just on a plane, I think, well, I'm going somewhere and just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:00">0:19:00-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  often where I do that sort of thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:11</a>:</strong>  And I sketched that, I sketched out some words and I put regenerative and agrarian together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:11">0:19:11-0:19:16</a>:</strong>  And so I got it so regrarian.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:16">0:19:16-0:19:21</a>:</strong>  And so it's a regenerative agrarian, basically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:21">0:19:21-0:19:24</a>:</strong>  And that was a big moment for us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:24">0:19:24-0:19:30</a>:</strong>  And then with the platform, we'll use, as I said before, using the Keyline Scale of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:30">0:19:30-0:19:35</a>:</strong>  Permanence in that first training with those holistic management educators, that just,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:35">0:19:35-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  it was a revelation in terms of, well, here's a start and here's a finish.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:46</a>:</strong>  And here's a process and being a process person, it just was a fright.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:46">0:19:46-0:19:51</a>:</strong>  So I started to look at the Keyline Scale of Permanence more closely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:51">0:19:51-0:19:56</a>:</strong>  By this stage, I was pretty heavily involved with holistic management and I was thinking,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:19:56">0:19:56-0:20:02</a>:</strong>  well, the Keyline Scale of Permanence is all about, well, the full title of the Keyline<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:02">0:20:02-0:20:08</a>:</strong>  Scale of Permanence is it's this Keyline Scale of Permanence of all things agricultural.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:08">0:20:08-0:20:14</a>:</strong>  And really, it only dealt with the physical realms of agriculture, like where to put water<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:14">0:20:14-0:20:21</a>:</strong>  systems, where to put roads, where to put trees, where to put fences, how to fix your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:21">0:20:21-0:20:24</a>:</strong>  soils, where to put farm buildings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:24">0:20:24-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  And so with that, it wasn't holistic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:29">0:20:29-0:20:33</a>:</strong>  And so I started to think about it a bit more and I went, all right, well, climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:33">0:20:33-0:20:38</a>:</strong>  And it sort of came to me, well, the climate of the mind, I started to sort of jam or riff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:38">0:20:38-0:20:40</a>:</strong>  climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:40">0:20:40-0:20:43</a>:</strong>  And I thought, well, the climate of the mind, the climate of the mind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:43">0:20:43-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  And other climate, the way people use the term climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:20:53</a>:</strong>  And I thought, well, yeah, the climate of the mind is just as fixed as the climate of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:20:53">0:20:53-0:21:02</a>:</strong>  our atmosphere or the climate that's climates that we live in and so many other climates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:02">0:21:02-0:21:13</a>:</strong>  And so that sort of came to me then that holistic management and that other elements, the other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:13">0:21:13-0:21:20</a>:</strong>  layers of the key line scale of permanence could be adapted to be more holistic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:20">0:21:20-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  So that I changed, so I changed the emphasis of climate in the scale of permanence from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  being just about the climate that you're into, the climate of the people that you're working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:37</a>:</strong>  with, because I'd always found that, you know, the properties and the places, the projects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:37">0:21:37-0:21:38</a>:</strong>  were the easy part.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:38">0:21:38-0:21:44</a>:</strong>  I'd always said that, you know, if only the people would get out of the way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:44">0:21:44-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  And I found that too in my own project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:48">0:21:48-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:53</a>:</strong>  They're usually the, those are the variables you can't control nearly as much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:53">0:21:53-0:21:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:54">0:21:54-0:21:57</a>:</strong>  So it seemed as fixed to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:21:57">0:21:57-0:22:03</a>:</strong>  And so right at the top of the list of things to deal with and in the holistic management,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:03">0:22:03-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  the first thing you need to create is a holistic context.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:12</a>:</strong>  So you get the, you get the person right and then you deal with the project.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:12">0:22:12-0:22:17</a>:</strong>  And then I looked at land shape, which is number two, and I thought, well, land shape,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:17">0:22:17-0:22:19</a>:</strong>  only land shape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:19">0:22:19-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  So it pretty quickly came that I changed that to geography.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:25</a>:</strong>  I kept water as water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:25">0:22:25-0:22:30</a>:</strong>  Farm trees I changed to forestry because I just, I was trying to be a lot more inclusive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:30">0:22:30-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:31">0:22:31-0:22:32</a>:</strong>  In the words.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:32">0:22:32-0:22:33</a>:</strong>  In the brains of what you do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:38</a>:</strong>  So I did a lot of things in my own language and, and languages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:38">0:22:38-0:22:41</a>:</strong>  So I, so I did that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:41">0:22:41-0:22:42</a>:</strong>  Went to forestry, kept buildings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:42">0:22:42-0:22:43</a>:</strong>  I think it was farm buildings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:43">0:22:43-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  I went to buildings, went from subdivision to fencing, soils, status soils.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:22:57</a>:</strong>  But then there was no spot in there for economy or marketing and there was nothing about energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:22:57">0:22:57-0:23:05</a>:</strong>  So I put in economy after soils because I felt that in my own life I'd been able to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:05">0:23:05-0:23:11</a>:</strong>  change my personal, our family's economy much quicker than I could my soil, the soils on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:11">0:23:11-0:23:14</a>:</strong>  our farms or our clients' farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:14">0:23:14-0:23:15</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:19</a>:</strong>  And that was an essential part for the development of the people there as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:19">0:23:19-0:23:20</a>:</strong>  Correct.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:20">0:23:20-0:23:25</a>:</strong>  And, and then, and then I thought, well, where does energy go?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:25">0:23:25-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  And energy, I thought, well, it goes last because, you know, there's nothing as fleeting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:32</a>:</strong>  as a photon of light.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:32">0:23:32-0:23:36</a>:</strong>  And you know, basically that's what drives this whole planet is the light that comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:36">0:23:36-0:23:38</a>:</strong>  in from the sun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:38">0:23:38-0:23:42</a>:</strong>  So so that was where we started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:42">0:23:42-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  I called it the Regen10 to start with because I hadn't developed the term agrarians.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:23:51</a>:</strong>  And then once I'd done that, I thought, well, here's a platform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:51">0:23:51-0:23:56</a>:</strong>  And so I thought I called it the Regrarian's platform and life really hasn't been the same<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:56">0:23:56-0:23:57</a>:</strong>  since.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:23:57">0:23:57-0:24:07</a>:</strong>  I'd say it's become an obsession, but it's, you know, we've taught hundreds of courses<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:07">0:24:07-0:24:14</a>:</strong>  now with the Regrarian's platform being at the centrepiece, it's made our life so much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:14">0:24:14-0:24:22</a>:</strong>  easier and it's made our designs a lot richer and a lot more targeted and our work a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:22">0:24:22-0:24:23</a>:</strong>  more targeted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:23">0:24:23-0:24:29</a>:</strong>  And I think from the feedback I've had of a lot of consultants that we've trained, they've,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:29">0:24:29-0:24:35</a>:</strong>  it's been a big breath to share to bring that into their working life as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:35">0:24:35-0:24:36</a>:</strong>  So yeah, we've been pretty pleased.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:36">0:24:36-0:24:37</a>:</strong>  I think that's fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:37">0:24:37-0:24:42</a>:</strong>  And that's been one of the main things out of the work that you've done, both in speeches<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:42">0:24:42-0:24:46</a>:</strong>  and videos and other things that I've been able to find because I haven't been able to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:46">0:24:46-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  take your course in person, that has been really influential in my own work, which is,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:54</a>:</strong>  you know, very similar to what you do, perhaps with a little bit more of an emphasis on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:54">0:24:54-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  building side.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:25:03</a>:</strong>  But now, so you just gave us the really quick view of those 10 layers that you build in,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:03">0:25:03-0:25:08</a>:</strong>  the soil layer, forestry layer, building and so on, in even those more abstract ones that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:08">0:25:08-0:25:09</a>:</strong>  you added on later.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:09">0:25:09-0:25:14</a>:</strong>  Could you explain how your layer system sort of interacts with one another in order to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:14">0:25:14-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  make a holistic design?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's a great question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:19">0:25:19-0:25:23</a>:</strong>  We tend to go through with people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:23">0:25:23-0:25:25</a>:</strong>  So what are you asking?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:25">0:25:25-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  Like if I get a client, how do I use it to interact with them?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:33</a>:</strong>  And they're not necessarily with the client, although that's important too, but how all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:33">0:25:33-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  the different layers interact with one another, either in opposition or in synergy in order<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:39">0:25:39-0:25:46</a>:</strong>  to help the design along sort of become bigger than the sum of its individual parts?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:46">0:25:46-0:25:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:47">0:25:47-0:25:55</a>:</strong>  The when I started with it, it wasn't obvious to me because I used it initially as a teaching<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:25:55">0:25:55-0:26:04</a>:</strong>  tool to be thorough because I like being thorough and it wasn't immediately obvious.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:04">0:26:04-0:26:09</a>:</strong>  And then once I started, because teaching is a really powerful way of sort of thrashing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:09">0:26:09-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  out ideas and getting that immediate feedback and all the rest of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:17</a>:</strong>  And we've always done design while we're teaching.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:17">0:26:17-0:26:25</a>:</strong>  So we've always had an example property or something to focus on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:25">0:26:25-0:26:28</a>:</strong>  And so we'd applied the scale accordingly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:28">0:26:28-0:26:34</a>:</strong>  And it became fairly obvious fairly quickly that by running through with this platform,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:34">0:26:34-0:26:42</a>:</strong>  then you could then in terms of the interactions that would occur, they were largely ones of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:42">0:26:42-0:26:46</a>:</strong>  elimination as much as anything else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:46">0:26:46-0:26:52</a>:</strong>  So for example, if you look at climate like that, you create the holistic context, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:26:52">0:26:52-0:27:02</a>:</strong>  is that core rules of the game, if you like, or rules of engagement that you create for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:02">0:27:02-0:27:07</a>:</strong>  doing any project and everything bounces off that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:07">0:27:07-0:27:13</a>:</strong>  And with that, once you've defined what your enterprises are going to be and what you want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:13">0:27:13-0:27:19</a>:</strong>  to do and what you don't want to do, then for example, the forestry layer, when you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:19">0:27:19-0:27:24</a>:</strong>  look at that, you go, okay, well, there's certain things that I might have done that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:24">0:27:24-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  I may not do now as far as tree installations are concerned, or there's buildings that I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:32</a>:</strong>  may or may not have done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:32">0:27:32-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  If I look at the geographies, I look at, as I think you might've heard before, I look<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  at climate as being the rules of the game or the rules of engagement and geography is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:50</a>:</strong>  like, and the geography of the place, like where you are, what the landform is like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:50">0:27:50-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  et cetera, is really the board game.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:27:59</a>:</strong>  So it's the template that you've, it's the palette that you've got to work with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:27:59">0:27:59-0:28:04</a>:</strong>  I love that as you're looking at things, it definitely simplifies it and helps to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:04">0:28:04-0:28:07</a>:</strong>  sort of how each part interacts with one another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:07">0:28:07-0:28:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:08">0:28:08-0:28:16</a>:</strong>  So the game as it were, that I play with my clients and with my students is the interaction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:16">0:28:16-0:28:23</a>:</strong>  between the context of the humans and the context of the landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:23">0:28:23-0:28:29</a>:</strong>  And of course the climate, the biospheric climate, which is the sort of overriding factor<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:29">0:28:29-0:28:33</a>:</strong>  that determines what you can and can't do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:33">0:28:33-0:28:35</a>:</strong>  And so it's really a marriage between those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:35">0:28:35-0:28:40</a>:</strong>  And so when you look at the, what I call the development layers, development management<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:40">0:28:40-0:28:46</a>:</strong>  layers of water, forestry, access, buildings, fencing, soils, et cetera, you know, they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:46">0:28:46-0:28:48</a>:</strong>  all development layers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:48">0:28:48-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  And then you've got economy, which is more of a management layer, and you've got energy,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:53">0:28:53-0:28:57</a>:</strong>  which is both a management and development layer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  You sort of in that initial looking at those at the marriage of the context, you then sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:07</a>:</strong>  of going through the list and going, no, I don't need this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:07">0:29:07-0:29:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I do need that sort of thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:10">0:29:10-0:29:18</a>:</strong>  And you find yourself then, like if I'm looking at what's the relationship between soils and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:18">0:29:18-0:29:19</a>:</strong>  water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:19">0:29:19-0:29:28</a>:</strong>  Well, if I'm looking at soils, I might be trying to manage better drainage in my soils,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:28">0:29:28-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  or I might be trying to increase the amount of water that's in my soils.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:36</a>:</strong>  So you do have that interaction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:36">0:29:36-0:29:41</a>:</strong>  You might look at what's the relationship between buildings and fencing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:41">0:29:41-0:29:47</a>:</strong>  Well, some buildings need fences around them, some don't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:47">0:29:47-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  What type of fencing goes for what type of building?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:29:55</a>:</strong>  How does fencing relate to access and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:29:55">0:29:55-0:30:02</a>:</strong>  So there's all of those interactions between the layers, some of which will help you to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:02">0:30:02-0:30:08</a>:</strong>  eliminate things that you might have otherwise done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:08">0:30:08-0:30:14</a>:</strong>  And some will help you to help, those interactions will help guide what you will actually ultimately<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:14">0:30:14-0:30:15</a>:</strong>  do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:15">0:30:15-0:30:18</a>:</strong>  I don't know if that completely answers your question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:18">0:30:18-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  That's fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:23</a>:</strong>  And now I want to go back and focus a little bit on something that you talked about earlier,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:23">0:30:23-0:30:24</a>:</strong>  and that's the economic layer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:24">0:30:24-0:30:28</a>:</strong>  Now I know you focus a lot on the business side of helping clients and students to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:28">0:30:28-0:30:36</a>:</strong>  their enterprises profitable, but I found that the persistent idea, especially within<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:36">0:30:36-0:30:43</a>:</strong>  ecological circles, which is that a company that is for profit can only be destructive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:43">0:30:43-0:30:48</a>:</strong>  And can you give me a short overview on some of the ways that a business can be both profitable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:48">0:30:48-0:30:49</a>:</strong>  and regenerative?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:49">0:30:49-0:30:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's an interesting one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:30:51">0:30:51-0:31:01</a>:</strong>  I saw a note by someone recently who said that people who are sort of trying to work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:01">0:31:01-0:31:07</a>:</strong>  their way through the economic issues and the economic system that we have and their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:07">0:31:07-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  problems with capital.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:11">0:31:11-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  And I very much look at capital through the lens of what Ethan Rowland and Gregory Landwey<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:25</a>:</strong>  have developed with their eight forms of capital or regenerative capital, in that capital is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:25">0:31:25-0:31:32</a>:</strong>  not just about financial capital, it's also about social capital and natural capital and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:32">0:31:32-0:31:37</a>:</strong>  experiential capital and so on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:37">0:31:37-0:31:43</a>:</strong>  And so when you bring that conversation into the climate discussion as we do, so it's sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:43">0:31:43-0:31:47</a>:</strong>  of because it's a, you know, when we're having that climate discussion in our platform, we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:47">0:31:47-0:31:52</a>:</strong>  talking about some fairly heady stuff, if you like, and, you know, the sort of frameworks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:52">0:31:52-0:31:57</a>:</strong>  that we're going to, like, the climate is like the operating system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:31:57">0:31:57-0:32:01</a>:</strong>  And you know, what's our operating system about?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:01">0:32:01-0:32:05</a>:</strong>  And what are our core ethics?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:05">0:32:05-0:32:06</a>:</strong>  What's important to us?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:06">0:32:06-0:32:15</a>:</strong>  And so with that, we then start a conversation around growth models, no growth models, incentivising<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:15">0:32:15-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  workers or labour instead of just paying labour, allowing labour to actually get equity, all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:33</a>:</strong>  of those different ways of doing it, as opposed to just having the classic hierarchical model<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:33">0:32:33-0:32:39</a>:</strong>  where you've, which also, you know, for some people works fine, where you've got a husband<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:46</a>:</strong>  and wife or core team of owners, and then you've got labour, and there's quite a separation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:46">0:32:46-0:32:47</a>:</strong>  between that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:47">0:32:47-0:32:56</a>:</strong>  I find that in the conversations around in this space that a lot of the conversation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:32:56">0:32:56-0:33:04</a>:</strong>  is around the lack of community that seems to be built by capitalism.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:04">0:33:04-0:33:12</a>:</strong>  And that said, I've worked in a number of businesses of all types, classic hierarchical<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:12">0:33:12-0:33:24</a>:</strong>  types to work around co-ops and all of that sort of thing, that it's really the leadership<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:24">0:33:24-0:33:30</a>:</strong>  and those rules of engagement that define whether that's a good workplace and whether<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:30">0:33:30-0:33:37</a>:</strong>  people are happy, and whether the landscape becomes happy as a result, the ecology becomes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:37">0:33:37-0:33:39</a>:</strong>  happy as a result.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:39">0:33:39-0:33:44</a>:</strong>  And so I don't think there's really any one method, it's really something that has to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:44">0:33:44-0:33:49</a>:</strong>  be self-determined by the players.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:49">0:33:49-0:33:54</a>:</strong>  And that's something that can only be done with some inclusivity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:33:54">0:33:54-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  And that's why I really like the holistic management, holistic context process, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  everyone is a decision maker.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:10</a>:</strong>  And if they have their contribution to make and they understand where they are in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:10">0:34:10-0:34:19</a>:</strong>  decision making process, then happiness is more likely to be achieved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:19">0:34:19-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  And then the business model is the way that we develop the business model around that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:35</a>:</strong>  That's complex because it has the business just started, what levels of debt has it got,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:35">0:34:35-0:34:43</a>:</strong>  so much, how much equity does it have, all of those sorts of things really in some cases<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:43">0:34:43-0:34:47</a>:</strong>  tie your hands as far as how different you can be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:47">0:34:47-0:34:51</a>:</strong>  And it also depends on the people involved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:51">0:34:51-0:34:54</a>:</strong>  Some people just like turning up to work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:54">0:34:54-0:34:59</a>:</strong>  And they say that we like it, they don't want to be in business and do all of the stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:34:59">0:34:59-0:35:04</a>:</strong>  that goes with running a business, they just want to turn up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:04">0:35:04-0:35:08</a>:</strong>  So you really got to ask the people what they want.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:08">0:35:08-0:35:15</a>:</strong>  And that's why I've always been a fan of self-determination and respecting the individual and asking the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:15">0:35:15-0:35:19</a>:</strong>  individual, but do that within a holistic whole.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:19">0:35:19-0:35:23</a>:</strong>  If people understand that's the way things generally work, well then things get along<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:23">0:35:23-0:35:24</a>:</strong>  fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:24">0:35:24-0:35:27</a>:</strong>  That's a great perspective there, I really agree with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:27">0:35:27-0:35:31</a>:</strong>  And I have also found a lot of those things to be true with the clients that I've worked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:31">0:35:31-0:35:34</a>:</strong>  with myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:34">0:35:34-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  Because if you push way too hard on a regenerative agenda or an environmental agenda without<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:46</a>:</strong>  focusing sufficiently on making sure that the business model is viable, all of your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:46">0:35:46-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  best intentions are either going to be limited or temporary because you do have to take care<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:54</a>:</strong>  of that, like you said, that holistic management part.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:54">0:35:54-0:35:59</a>:</strong>  And the variables that come in with every single client or every single enterprise are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:35:59">0:35:59-0:36:06</a>:</strong>  so unique in each situation that I think it was really valuable that you said you really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:06">0:36:06-0:36:11</a>:</strong>  have to take them on a case by case basis, but there's also many different ways to achieve<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:11">0:36:11-0:36:17</a>:</strong>  positive results, both with a profit and in a way that's good for the land and the environment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:17">0:36:17-0:36:20</a>:</strong>  and the people as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:20">0:36:20-0:36:25</a>:</strong>  In my book, the book that we're writing, The Climate Chapter, the first section of that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:25">0:36:25-0:36:30</a>:</strong>  book talks about different, what I call regenerative design principles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:30">0:36:30-0:36:37</a>:</strong>  And they're a collection of principles that I've found over the years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:37">0:36:37-0:36:41</a>:</strong>  And a lot of people say in the permaculture movement, they just follow permaculture design<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:41">0:36:41-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  principles, which are fine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:49</a>:</strong>  Both Bill Mollison and David Holmgren came up with a list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:49">0:36:49-0:36:54</a>:</strong>  But there's lots of other people out there in this whole in the movement, if you like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:54">0:36:54-0:36:56</a>:</strong>  who've created their own lists.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:36:56">0:36:56-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  And I started it off actually with my grandparents.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:05</a>:</strong>  My grandfather was a bit of a Bush intellectual.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:05">0:37:05-0:37:12</a>:</strong>  And I remember he said to me once when I was only seven or eight, he said, to profit is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:12">0:37:12-0:37:14</a>:</strong>  to steal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:14">0:37:14-0:37:16</a>:</strong>  And I said, oh, what do you mean by that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:16">0:37:16-0:37:22</a>:</strong>  We said, well, you know, he grew up in the 1930s and so he was born in 1915.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:22">0:37:22-0:37:24</a>:</strong>  And so he grew up in the Depression.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:24">0:37:24-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  That was his formulative years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:26">0:37:26-0:37:35</a>:</strong>  And he really saw what happened when profit really did steal, because you could see that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:35">0:37:35-0:37:41</a>:</strong>  through the excesses of what caused the Great Depression with the financial markets crashing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:41">0:37:41-0:37:44</a>:</strong>  And you saw that again in 2008 with the global financial crisis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:44">0:37:44-0:37:53</a>:</strong>  So it was just pure greed that caused greed with some more creative algorithms that caused<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:53">0:37:53-0:37:54</a>:</strong>  the crash.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:54">0:37:54-0:37:55</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:55">0:37:55-0:37:57</a>:</strong>  It's a cult, but it's still the same on the inside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:57">0:37:57-0:37:58</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:58">0:37:58-0:37:59</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:37:59">0:37:59-0:38:03</a>:</strong>  And so I sort of thought about that as I grew up, because he said a number of things to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:03">0:38:03-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  Like another one was, you know, humans are just like yeast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:13</a>:</strong>  They eat all of the sugar and then they'll die in their own shit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:13">0:38:13-0:38:16</a>:</strong>  And as a sort of a as a lesson around ecology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:16">0:38:16-0:38:21</a>:</strong>  And it's all about, you know, taking if you take too much from today, then you'll you'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  be gone for tomorrow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:30</a>:</strong>  So my work with indigenous people here in Australia, it's a general indigenous principle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:35</a>:</strong>  that across the nations of Australia that, you know, if you find a bush that's got a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:35">0:38:35-0:38:39</a>:</strong>  whole lot of fruit on it, then you don't strip the whole tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:44</a>:</strong>  Always leave some for the animals and you leave some for the other passerby who's coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:44">0:38:44-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  to take what you need and leave it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:48</a>:</strong>  And that to me is all there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:48">0:38:48-0:38:54</a>:</strong>  They're all very linked to what profit should be that what profit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:54">0:38:54-0:38:59</a>:</strong>  If you look at an apple tree, an apple tree is a great example or a cherry tree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:38:59">0:38:59-0:39:08</a>:</strong>  Any of those great or an oak or just about any trade is an awesome example of of it giving<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:08">0:39:08-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  the profit of its interaction with the soil and with the sky and the minerals that flow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:16">0:39:16-0:39:20</a>:</strong>  through that species and that it's giving off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:20">0:39:20-0:39:24</a>:</strong>  Why does a tree give off 500 pounds of apples?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:24">0:39:24-0:39:27</a>:</strong>  I mean, what's the sense in that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:27">0:39:27-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  What's what's the benefit to the tree?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  That's that's that tree's profit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:40</a>:</strong>  And it's up to us to to then, you know, take that on and go, OK, well, how can we be the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:40">0:39:40-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  apple tree in what we do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:45</a>:</strong>  How can we be that cherry or that acorn?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:45">0:39:45-0:39:51</a>:</strong>  And also, you know, I think it was Ethan Roland who said he had a company called Apple Seed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:51">0:39:51-0:39:52</a>:</strong>  Permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:52">0:39:52-0:39:59</a>:</strong>  He said something like, well, how many apples come from one apple seed?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:39:59">0:39:59-0:40:06</a>:</strong>  And it's again, you know, you've got this this power in life, which is exponential and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:06">0:40:06-0:40:11</a>:</strong>  incredible and the ultimate compound interest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:11">0:40:11-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  And I really get excited by that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:20</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, so profit doesn't have to be the dirty word that my grandfather saw.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:20">0:40:20-0:40:25</a>:</strong>  It can actually be just like climate and a whole lot of other words that we use.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:25">0:40:25-0:40:29</a>:</strong>  They thought of quite powerfully across a whole range of domains.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:29">0:40:29-0:40:36</a>:</strong>  And and that's that's what I try and bring to this, that that, you know, it doesn't have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:36">0:40:36-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  to be just one way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  You can you can be a profitable nonprofit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  You can and you should be, because otherwise you'll be bound to your benefactors, bound<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:56</a>:</strong>  to your patrons, to your grant cycle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:40:56">0:40:56-0:41:06</a>:</strong>  That you should always be trying to have your system get better and use these great examples<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:06">0:41:06-0:41:08</a>:</strong>  that nature has given us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:08">0:41:08-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  I think that's a very powerful analogy that you've that you've used there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:15</a>:</strong>  And I wholeheartedly agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:15">0:41:15-0:41:19</a>:</strong>  Now I wanted to touch on something that you mentioned a little while back and frankly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:19">0:41:19-0:41:23</a>:</strong>  is one of my favorite things about the work that you do, which is you promote an idea<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:23">0:41:23-0:41:28</a>:</strong>  of working with a full deck, meaning that you sample from all the best ideas from many<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:30</a>:</strong>  different innovators around the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:30">0:41:30-0:41:33</a>:</strong>  Obviously, you mentioned permaculture as one of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:33">0:41:33-0:41:39</a>:</strong>  But Alan Savory's work with dryland restoration or Paul's statements with fungi and bioremediation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:39">0:41:39-0:41:44</a>:</strong>  transition communities, effluent cleanup with plants and waterways, and the list goes on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:44">0:41:44-0:41:46</a>:</strong>  and on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:46">0:41:46-0:41:51</a>:</strong>  Why has it been so important to you to constantly broaden the toolbox that you use for your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:51">0:41:51-0:41:57</a>:</strong>  work and not to be too focused on any one practice?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:41:57">0:41:57-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  Well I think when you do the personality assessment, I've been classified as an innovator.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  So I have that personality type that I don't know that all innovators are the same.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:20</a>:</strong>  Some innovators I suppose would be those that are just, if you're an electrical innovator,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:20">0:42:20-0:42:28</a>:</strong>  then you wouldn't necessarily be looking at biology for your electrical innovation that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:28">0:42:28-0:42:32</a>:</strong>  still to come, although some would through biomimicry, for example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:32">0:42:32-0:42:39</a>:</strong>  But for me, I've always had a very broad interest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:39">0:42:39-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  I started reading when I was three.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:42:50</a>:</strong>  My parents gave me a, I think I was about five or six, they bought me the world book<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:42:50">0:42:50-0:43:01</a>:</strong>  encyclopedia and so that was my first book, twenty-six volumes or whatever it was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:01">0:43:01-0:43:10</a>:</strong>  So my interests have always been really wide and so it seems only natural when you're working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:10">0:43:10-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  in this trade that you would not be stuck in one methodological box and I think people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:23</a>:</strong>  like P.A.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:23">0:43:23-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  Yeomans, when I read him, I didn't come across permaculture straight away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:30">0:43:30-0:43:37</a>:</strong>  I think while I was still working in hospitality, I was doing a lot of reading on ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:37">0:43:37-0:43:44</a>:</strong>  agriculture so I read, I think I read Masanobu Fukuoka's One Straw Revolution first.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:44">0:43:44-0:43:45</a>:</strong>  That's a classic, yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:45">0:43:45-0:43:46</a>:</strong>  It's a great book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:46">0:43:46-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  It gets a lot of people started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I was about eighteen or nineteen and he was quite broad in his influence.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:43:57">0:43:57-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  He talked about being a microbiologist and he talked about different influences to things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:03">0:44:03-0:44:09</a>:</strong>  and he ultimately travelled when you read his other books, which I did.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:09">0:44:09-0:44:12</a>:</strong>  I read Yeomans pretty early and P.A.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:12">0:44:12-0:44:18</a>:</strong>  Yeomans said, you know, he looked at soil, he looked at the principles of soil conservation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:18">0:44:18-0:44:24</a>:</strong>  from the Army Corps of Engineers in the US and he looked at Louis Bromfield's work and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:24">0:44:24-0:44:31</a>:</strong>  he looked at a lot of the other people of the nineteen forties and fifties who were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:31">0:44:31-0:44:38</a>:</strong>  the pioneers of the organic agriculture movement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:38">0:44:38-0:44:42</a>:</strong>  And so I looked at, you know, you sort of look to people who influence you I suppose<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:42">0:44:42-0:44:44</a>:</strong>  and so, well, you know, how did they get by?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:44">0:44:44-0:44:50</a>:</strong>  What were some of their intellectual stimuli and of course then coming along with Bill<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:50">0:44:50-0:44:55</a>:</strong>  Mollison and, you know, it was fairly clear, especially when I met Bill and to an extent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:44:55">0:44:55-0:45:03</a>:</strong>  David, that even they, their interests were quite broad, you know, they were looking at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:03">0:45:03-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  all of these different people and what they were doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:12</a>:</strong>  I suppose though with the exception being that in permaculture, and I won't say this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:12">0:45:12-0:45:20</a>:</strong>  is always the case, but permaculture becomes an appropriation society where everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:20">0:45:20-0:45:25</a>:</strong>  becomes permaculture even though it wasn't developed with, you know, what I call something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:25">0:45:25-0:45:32</a>:</strong>  as being permaculture is where permaculture ethics and design principles have been used<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:32">0:45:32-0:45:37</a>:</strong>  in the formation of an idea or a concept.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:37">0:45:37-0:45:44</a>:</strong>  Whereas if I go and take Paul Stamets work and I call that permaculture, well that to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:45:45</a>:</strong>  me is appropriation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:45">0:45:45-0:45:51</a>:</strong>  Or if I take Alan Savory's work and I put that in and I call that permaculture, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:51">0:45:51-0:45:52</a>:</strong>  to me is appropriation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:52">0:45:52-0:45:59</a>:</strong>  So it's a bit disingenuous to go down that pathway and it's a movement that's been fairly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:45:59">0:45:59-0:46:05</a>:</strong>  strong on doing that as I've observed from working within it and looking outside of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:05">0:46:05-0:46:14</a>:</strong>  So yeah, just having that, just realising that no single person or no single methodology<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:14">0:46:14-0:46:21</a>:</strong>  has all of the answers that you really got to look at as Kirk Gadzia I think came up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:21">0:46:21-0:46:24</a>:</strong>  with the term, you know, playing with a full deck.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:24">0:46:24-0:46:25</a>:</strong>  Don't discount anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:25">0:46:25-0:46:30</a>:</strong>  There's going to be, and it goes through to my attitude with people as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:30">0:46:30-0:46:38</a>:</strong>  I mean, I've got mates who are billion, literally billionaires and I've got mates who earn $20,000<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:38">0:46:38-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  a year who are cleaners and they all, everyone has something to contribute.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:52</a>:</strong>  If you're a good person and you're alive, you're observing things and you're making<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:52">0:46:52-0:46:54</a>:</strong>  those observations and you're sharing them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:54">0:46:54-0:46:59</a>:</strong>  So there's something, someone's got something, everyone's got something to contribute therefore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:46:59">0:46:59-0:47:03</a>:</strong>  Which I think is what it really comes down to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:03">0:47:03-0:47:04</a>:</strong>  That's a very important way to look at that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:04">0:47:04-0:47:05</a>:</strong>  I completely agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:05">0:47:05-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  Now up until this point we've mostly talked about some of the theories and the ideas that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:15</a>:</strong>  you've either fostered or have adopted yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:15">0:47:15-0:47:21</a>:</strong>  But let me switch to a little, a bit of a different approach and talk about a really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:27</a>:</strong>  important and practical question that's essential to almost any landscape restoration project<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:27">0:47:27-0:47:29</a>:</strong>  and that's soil building.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:29">0:47:29-0:47:34</a>:</strong>  So I've heard you mention in the past that the fastest way to create soil is with grass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:34">0:47:34-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  Now this seems counterintuitive to many people who put a lot of effort into mulching and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  composting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:43</a>:</strong>  So can you explain how this works and what elements are needed to build soil on a large<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:43">0:47:43-0:47:44</a>:</strong>  scale?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:44">0:47:44-0:47:45</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:45">0:47:45-0:47:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah so I think that, so if I look at the three examples that you've just given me,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:47:55">0:47:55-0:48:03</a>:</strong>  I look at grass because if I just go and put mulch on the ground and I solely do that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:03">0:48:03-0:48:12</a>:</strong>  then I look at well what's the mineral cycle, what's the effect of the mineral cycle on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:12">0:48:12-0:48:16</a>:</strong>  that, what's the effect of the water cycle on that and what's the effect of the energy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:16">0:48:16-0:48:19</a>:</strong>  cycle on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:19">0:48:19-0:48:25</a>:</strong>  So the ecosystem processes as described by Alan Savory in Holistic Management.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:25">0:48:25-0:48:32</a>:</strong>  So when we look at the water cycle, water will come from rain or if it comes by rain<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:32">0:48:32-0:48:39</a>:</strong>  it will be, its fall will be softened by the application of mulch and infiltration will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:39">0:48:39-0:48:47</a>:</strong>  be more likely as opposed to runoff if rainfall hits a litter layer which is basically what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:47">0:48:47-0:48:55</a>:</strong>  mulch is, a thick litter layer and somewhat unnaturally thick in a lot of cases.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:55">0:48:55-0:48:57</a>:</strong>  And then you have, well what's the mineral cycle?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:48:57">0:48:57-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  Well part of it, a lot of that mulch is exposed to sunlight and the oxygen in the air so a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:05">0:49:05-0:49:12</a>:</strong>  lot of it's going to oxidise and return into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, the rust<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:12">0:49:12-0:49:18</a>:</strong>  of carbon and some of it which is in contact with the soil, if there's adequate moisture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:18">0:49:18-0:49:24</a>:</strong>  in the soil will be broken down biologically and the minerals will be cycled into the biology<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:24">0:49:24-0:49:31</a>:</strong>  of the soil, some of which will be labile, therefore some of the organisms, in fact a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:31">0:49:31-0:49:39</a>:</strong>  lot of those organisms will be aerobic organisms so they'll exhale the carbon that they consume<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:39">0:49:39-0:49:46</a>:</strong>  in part as carbon dioxide, some of that carbon will go into their bodies and into the creation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:46">0:49:46-0:49:53</a>:</strong>  of their manures and all their byproducts, their secretions etc. which will have varying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:49:53">0:49:53-0:50:03</a>:</strong>  levels of degradation time, therefore re-entry back into the atmosphere in that form of carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:03">0:50:03-0:50:05</a>:</strong>  and other minerals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:05">0:50:05-0:50:13</a>:</strong>  Then we look at the energy cycle, well the energy cycle, the sunlight's coming down and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:13">0:50:13-0:50:24</a>:</strong>  it's burning this stuff up so it's enhancing the speed of the mineral cycle so is it sustainable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:24">0:50:24-0:50:29</a>:</strong>  therefore to apply mulch?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:29">0:50:29-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  Well mulch is an inert, relatively inert material that is going to be decomposed by something,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:40">0:50:40-0:50:48</a>:</strong>  it has value but if I just go and put mulch down that's not going to do everything, it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:48">0:50:48-0:50:55</a>:</strong>  will build a little bit of soil where you get the soil contact but a lot of that's going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:50:55">0:50:55-0:51:00</a>:</strong>  to be extinguished if I just left a pile of mulch on and I come back in five years time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:00">0:51:00-0:51:05</a>:</strong>  in a lot of places I'll go back to bare soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:05">0:51:05-0:51:11</a>:</strong>  Like if I'm where you are in Guatemala where it's in the tropics, subtropics, tropics,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:11">0:51:11-0:51:21</a>:</strong>  if I put three inches of straw mulch on the ground it would probably not be there in six<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:21">0:51:21-0:51:26</a>:</strong>  to eight months depending on the time of year and I'd come back and that soil would be bare<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:26">0:51:26-0:51:32</a>:</strong>  again just because of the sunlight being so strong and the number of organisms who would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:32">0:51:32-0:51:34</a>:</strong>  consume it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:34">0:51:34-0:51:40</a>:</strong>  Then the soil gets bare and then it gets exposed and then you lose what you've just gained.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:40">0:51:40-0:51:45</a>:</strong>  The other example that you gave was compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:45">0:51:45-0:51:50</a>:</strong>  Well compost is somewhat similar, if I just apply that topically which is what a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:51:50">0:51:50-0:52:00</a>:</strong>  people do then unless I have a plant community which is going to drive the energy flow of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:00">0:52:00-0:52:07</a>:</strong>  all of the organisms that are within that plant community to get it into the ground<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:07">0:52:07-0:52:15</a>:</strong>  then it's the same as mulch, it'll just literally oxidise and ultimately go away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:15">0:52:15-0:52:22</a>:</strong>  So mulch and compost are supportive elements to soil building but ultimately soil building<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:22">0:52:22-0:52:32</a>:</strong>  happens because of photosynthesis and the byproducts of photosynthesis so you can't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:32">0:52:32-0:52:38</a>:</strong>  do soil building without and you can't sustain soil building, you might be able to do it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:38">0:52:38-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  in the short term but you can't sustain it without plants and what you need to also look<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:50</a>:</strong>  at is alright well if I'm on a landscape let's look at plants, let's look at woody plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:50">0:52:50-0:52:54</a>:</strong>  and let's look at non-woody plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:52:54">0:52:54-0:53:01</a>:</strong>  Most woody plants don't have very fibrous root systems and most of them have, you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:01">0:53:01-0:53:08</a>:</strong>  if you go and clear a landscape of woody plants then the amount of the depth of soil that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:08">0:53:08-0:53:17</a>:</strong>  been created is generally fairly shallow and that's because in woody plant ecosystems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:17">0:53:17-0:53:27</a>:</strong>  the primary soil biological partners are fungal and fungi are aerobic and so the carbon that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:27">0:53:27-0:53:35</a>:</strong>  cycled through woody plant ecologies when they get to a state of homeostasis they become<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:35">0:53:35-0:53:41</a>:</strong>  the amount of carbon that's cycled is basically homeostatic, you have carbon come in and carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:41">0:53:41-0:53:49</a>:</strong>  go out and with a bit being put behind and you know if you look at a woody plant ecology<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:49">0:53:49-0:53:59</a>:</strong>  any woody plant, 50% thereabouts is carbon and then the rest that's contributed is cycled<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:53:59">0:53:59-0:54:05</a>:</strong>  by predominantly aerobic organisms in particular fungi because they're the organisms that can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:05">0:54:05-0:54:10</a>:</strong>  cycle the woody matter more easily than bacteria can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:10">0:54:10-0:54:19</a>:</strong>  So then we look at grasses as a type of non-woody plant and grasses of particularly perennial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:19">0:54:19-0:54:26</a>:</strong>  grasses have got really really fibrous root systems and relatively deep and their main<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:26">0:54:26-0:54:36</a>:</strong>  way of cycling carbon is not cycling it into their bodies but cycling it out as exudates<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:36">0:54:36-0:54:42</a>:</strong>  so woody plants have exudates too, they still function like all plants do where they make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:42">0:54:42-0:54:48</a>:</strong>  polysaccharides as a byproduct of photosynthesis and they exude some of those substances out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:48">0:54:48-0:54:56</a>:</strong>  through as secretions through their roots and so on and soil microlife then uses that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:54:56">0:54:56-0:55:03</a>:</strong>  as a smoothie, as a high energy smoothie and off it goes, it's the energy that drives the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:03">0:55:03-0:55:10</a>:</strong>  processes of the micro life in the soil so it's just that grasses have a lot more of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:10">0:55:10-0:55:16</a>:</strong>  that and they're not putting that carbon that they would into woody tissue and that's why<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:16">0:55:16-0:55:21</a>:</strong>  you know when you look at Eric Toensmeyer's The Carbon Farming Solution which is a great<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:21">0:55:21-0:55:28</a>:</strong>  piece as a starting piece I think because we've still got a lot to learn here that a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:28">0:55:28-0:55:36</a>:</strong>  lot of his effort is focused on agroforestry and as a known to be reliable means of storing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:36">0:55:36-0:55:45</a>:</strong>  carbon in woody plant tissue, that's no arguments there, what's not really well known and understood<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:45">0:55:45-0:55:59</a>:</strong>  is just how much grassy plant or non-woody plant exudation contributes to the amount<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:55:59">0:55:59-0:56:08</a>:</strong>  of carbon that is being stored and how that can be a contributor to climate change and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:08">0:56:08-0:56:12</a>:</strong>  it's because when you look at some of the tables that Eric's looking at in terms of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:12">0:56:12-0:56:18</a>:</strong>  research there's no research, there's been hardly any research at all by comparison with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:18">0:56:18-0:56:24</a>:</strong>  what there has been with woody plant systems. I think that's largely because woody plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:24">0:56:24-0:56:31</a>:</strong>  systems are really easy to or relatively easy to measure because you can just use forestry<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:31">0:56:31-0:56:36</a>:</strong>  measurement techniques to determine the amount biomass in a stand and then more or less half<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:36">0:56:36-0:56:41</a>:</strong>  that and that'll tell you how much carbon is sequestered into that stand of woody biomass<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:41">0:56:41-0:56:50</a>:</strong>  that's easy, foresters have been doing that forever. Whereas how do you measure soil carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:50">0:56:50-0:56:58</a>:</strong>  that's been put down to 1 metre and 2 metres of depth by non-woody plant tissue root systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:56:58">0:56:58-0:57:02</a>:</strong>  that's a harder call and there's just been very little which Eric has acknowledged in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:02">0:57:02-0:57:09</a>:</strong>  some of his tables, single research projects done on that. So we don't know very much on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:09">0:57:09-0:57:19</a>:</strong>  that but what I do know through my work is that when I've engaged with grasses through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:19">0:57:19-0:57:24</a>:</strong>  processes I can't say that I've sequestered more carbon because I haven't measured it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:24">0:57:24-0:57:29</a>:</strong>  I'm not going to stand up here and say that I've done that but what I have noticed is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:29">0:57:29-0:57:36</a>:</strong>  that the internal drainage characteristics of that soil have changed, the pidelity, so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:36">0:57:36-0:57:44</a>:</strong>  the amount of soil aggregation has changed so that I've got more peds, the soil has developed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:44">0:57:44-0:57:50</a>:</strong>  better structure. What I can also say is that the soil colour has changed and that the root<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:50">0:57:50-0:57:58</a>:</strong>  depth of the grasses and other plants that I'm working with in those systems has increased.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:57:58">0:57:58-0:58:02</a>:</strong>  Now again I'm not going to say that the soil carbon levels have changed because I haven't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:02">0:58:02-0:58:07</a>:</strong>  tested it and I'm not a scientist so I'm not going to stand up and say that but what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:07">0:58:07-0:58:15</a>:</strong>  I have noticed there are a whole host of other changes which have led to that soil being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:15">0:58:15-0:58:16</a>:</strong>  more productive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:16">0:58:16-0:58:21</a>:</strong>  Sure you've noticed some other very powerful indicators that would give you cause to believe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:21">0:58:21-0:58:23</a>:</strong>  that things are moving in the correct direction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:23">0:58:23-0:58:28</a>:</strong>  Correct and I've seen that repeatedly in a range of different climates on a range<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:28">0:58:28-0:58:39</a>:</strong>  of different parent materials, different geologies, soil types across the world. And with that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:39">0:58:39-0:58:48</a>:</strong>  I've also read a really great book years ago called Vegetation and Soils by S.J. Ayer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:48">0:58:48-0:58:55</a>:</strong>  who was an English geography teacher and he looked at the relationship between plant communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:58:55">0:58:55-0:59:02</a>:</strong>  and soils. And I was talking on a webinar the other day about this. We did a recs in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:02">0:59:02-0:59:07</a>:</strong>  Chile a couple of, last year and it was on some volcanic alluvium, one thousand year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:07">0:59:07-0:59:13</a>:</strong>  old volcanic alluvium. There's a big volcanic lake up in the Andes and every thousand years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:13">0:59:13-0:59:19</a>:</strong>  its wall breaches and all of the material in that wall comes down and becomes the new<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:19">0:59:19-0:59:26</a>:</strong>  layer of alluvium on the plane. You couldn't get a better situation, it's like a volcanic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:26">0:59:26-0:59:32</a>:</strong>  sandbox of basically rock dust. So it's really beautiful stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:32">0:59:32-0:59:35</a>:</strong>  A big mineral injection into the soils there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:35">0:59:35-0:59:42</a>:</strong>  But completely homogeneous, right? There's no stratification to the profile, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:42">0:59:42-0:59:52</a>:</strong>  a sameness to this. So you couldn't get a better large scale area on which to look at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=0:59:52">0:59:52-1:00:02</a>:</strong>  the influence that vegetation communities have on soil formation. And within about a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:02">1:00:02-1:00:08</a>:</strong>  three hundred metre area, quarter of mile area, there were four different vegetation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:08">1:00:08-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  communities. There was a eucalyptus globulus forest, blue gum forest, there was an oak<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:22</a>:</strong>  forest with an understory of blackberry, there was a pinus radiata or monterey pine forest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:22">1:00:22-1:00:29</a>:</strong>  and there was a perennial grassland. And with our training we went and had a look at, we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:29">1:00:29-1:00:37</a>:</strong>  dug the soil of each. Now remember a thousand years ago this was, there was nothing there,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:37">1:00:37-1:00:42</a>:</strong>  it was just a sandbox, right? And so now these different vegetation communities have been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:42">1:00:42-1:00:49</a>:</strong>  established with their different ways of interacting with the mineral cycle, with different suites<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:49">1:00:49-1:00:57</a>:</strong>  of organisms and different energy efficiencies. So the eucalyptus forest, we're going to have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:00:57">1:00:57-1:01:04</a>:</strong>  a look at it. The soil is thick with litter from all of the branches and leaves of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:04">1:01:04-1:01:14</a>:</strong>  eucalyptus trees. And you dig down and you've got a minor little layer of saprophytic fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:14">1:01:14-1:01:21</a>:</strong>  activity and then the soil is bone dry and structureless and compacted. Now if I go and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:21">1:01:21-1:01:29</a>:</strong>  push one of those trees over, the root systems are strong but they're small relative to what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:29">1:01:29-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  above the tree, what's above the ground. Most of the biomass in that organism is above ground,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:37">1:01:37-1:01:38</a>:</strong>  it's in the trunk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:38">1:01:38-1:01:44</a>:</strong>  Sure, it doesn't have the balances you would see in other places.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:44">1:01:44-1:01:50</a>:</strong>  No. And the roots are not fibrous, they're very, they're large and there's not very many<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:50">1:01:50-1:01:55</a>:</strong>  of them but the soil is bone dry and there's no soil building. It's all saprophytic fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:01:55">1:01:55-1:02:00</a>:</strong>  just doing the turnover into the atmosphere. Then I go to the pine forest, more or less<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:00">1:02:00-1:02:06</a>:</strong>  the same, very heavy litter of pine needles, bit of saprophytic activity, bit of bacterial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:06">1:02:06-1:02:14</a>:</strong>  activity as you can see. Dig down, a little bit more humus, what you might call humus,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:14">1:02:14-1:02:22</a>:</strong>  a bit more darkening or an A horizon. But then again you get down to about 10, 15 centimetres,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:22">1:02:22-1:02:28</a>:</strong>  bone dry, no soil structure being created, yeah no life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:28">1:02:28-1:02:34</a>:</strong>  Go to the oak forest with its understory of blackberry. Oaks are a bit wider spacing,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:34">1:02:34-1:02:40</a>:</strong>  they're deciduous. Blackberries which are really woody plant, primary woody plant, primary<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:40">1:02:40-1:02:48</a>:</strong>  successional woody plant. A few other plants on the ground story. Dig down, soil is moist,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:48">1:02:48-1:02:59</a>:</strong>  it's humid, obviously more bacterial activity because of the, of just the crumb structure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:02:59">1:02:59-1:03:05</a>:</strong>  of the soil and a bit deeper but then you get down and then there's a very clear stratification.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:05">1:03:05-1:03:12</a>:</strong>  We go from a strong O horizon which is the organic layer, very strong A horizon which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:12">1:03:12-1:03:20</a>:</strong>  is that humid and living soil, topsoil you might call it and then it's B horizon and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:20">1:03:20-1:03:27</a>:</strong>  it's just stark. Now we go up to the grassland. The grasses are not a well managed grass community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:27">1:03:27-1:03:37</a>:</strong>  so it's overgrazed so the roots are kept short because the top is kept short and but the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:37">1:03:37-1:03:43</a>:</strong>  crumb structure and the depth of that soil even though the amount of biomass above the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:43">1:03:43-1:03:52</a>:</strong>  ground is, you know we're talking about six inches versus a hundred feet, the soils in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:52">1:03:52-1:03:58</a>:</strong>  that grassland were about twice as deep. That is the living soil in that grassland was twice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:03:58">1:03:58-1:04:08</a>:</strong>  as deep. Even though that organism is, what's a hundred, six inches versus a hundred feet,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:08">1:04:08-1:04:16</a>:</strong>  half a foot, it's a two hundred times less above ground biomass just in terms of height<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:16">1:04:16-1:04:21</a>:</strong>  and if you look at in terms of quantity, I don't even know how to, that would take a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:21">1:04:21-1:04:26</a>:</strong>  bit more to work out but you see what I mean? So that was a really great and powerful example<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:26">1:04:26-1:04:36</a>:</strong>  for our group and for me after having read Ayer's book in the influence of root physiology<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:36">1:04:36-1:04:48</a>:</strong>  and the way that plants manage the outcomes of photosynthesis to the way that soils are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:48">1:04:48-1:04:53</a>:</strong>  visibly formed or not. I'll just put it in that way that they're visibly formed because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:04:53">1:04:53-1:05:00</a>:</strong>  I know that there's people out there who get a bit cranky about the lack of science in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:00">1:05:00-1:05:05</a>:</strong>  this but you know I asked them to get out and have a bit of a look themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:05">1:05:05-1:05:10</a>:</strong>  Sure and there's a lot of other ways of measuring progress and seeing how things are developing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:10">1:05:10-1:05:16</a>:</strong>  without taking a microscope to it and the traditional analytics of the scientific world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:16">1:05:16-1:05:20</a>:</strong>  It makes it a lot more approachable for people who have their own land projects to actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:20">1:05:20-1:05:24</a>:</strong>  contribute to the research that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:24">1:05:24-1:05:29</a>:</strong>  Yeah and that's not to say that like you find where you are, like if you're in the tropics<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:29">1:05:29-1:05:33</a>:</strong>  you know what's appropriate and that's what a lot of people are looking at like they'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:33">1:05:33-1:05:39</a>:</strong>  say well you know what people would do as people want to do is they'll hear from someone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:39">1:05:39-1:05:44</a>:</strong>  like me a leader in all of this and they'll say oh he says grass is the best way to go<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:44">1:05:44-1:05:48</a>:</strong>  or they'll listen to a savory and yeah he says grass is the best way to go but what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:48">1:05:48-1:05:54</a>:</strong>  they're not actually doing is looking inside the story and saying okay well not looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:05:54">1:05:54-1:06:00</a>:</strong>  at the again that marriage between contexts that marriage between the climate that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:00">1:06:00-1:06:05</a>:</strong>  live in the climate of you and the enterprise that you have and the climate of your geography<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:05">1:06:05-1:06:10</a>:</strong>  right and putting all of those things together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:10">1:06:10-1:06:17</a>:</strong>  Now if I'm in where you are in Central America it's tropical blah blah blah blah blah I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:17">1:06:17-1:06:23</a>:</strong>  not going to go and recommend to everybody that they go and set up a grassland and that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:23">1:06:23-1:06:30</a>:</strong>  going to be the end game but you may well use some non woody plants green manures and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:30">1:06:30-1:06:37</a>:</strong>  other non woody species to get your soil shifted from where it is now and it's horribly abused<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:37">1:06:37-1:06:44</a>:</strong>  condition over to a condition where it can accept woody biomass and foster the development<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:44">1:06:44-1:06:54</a>:</strong>  of woody biomass more effectively so we use it as a means to an end not just as the means<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:54">1:06:54-1:06:57</a>:</strong>  that becomes the end.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:06:57">1:06:57-1:07:02</a>:</strong>  You've got to actually be a lot broader than that and don't just take things that people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:02">1:07:02-1:07:07</a>:</strong>  take in isolation because that's what people do unfortunately.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:07">1:07:07-1:07:12</a>:</strong>  I think that's been the big takeaway of everything we've talked about so far today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:12">1:07:12-1:07:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah be thorough, just be thorough.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:15">1:07:15-1:07:19</a>:</strong>  Now once people are able to actually build their soils what are some of the essential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:19">1:07:19-1:07:24</a>:</strong>  things that you recommend to keep it from roting away again and to continue to have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:24">1:07:24-1:07:29</a>:</strong>  it build up on its own, make it a regenerative system?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:29">1:07:29-1:07:34</a>:</strong>  Well if I look at the context of say in the tropics for example let's say you're trying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:34">1:07:34-1:07:40</a>:</strong>  to develop an agroforestry system well then building plant communities and managing those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:40">1:07:40-1:07:52</a>:</strong>  plant communities so that you always contribute back to the soil surface and you have as much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:07:52">1:07:52-1:08:05</a>:</strong>  biological decomposition of any plant byproducts, what I mean by that are leaves and branches,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:05">1:08:05-1:08:10</a>:</strong>  that you have as much biological decomposition of that as possible whether that's true animals,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:10">1:08:10-1:08:15</a>:</strong>  or whether that's true soil like you know you might take branches.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:15">1:08:15-1:08:19</a>:</strong>  So you've got a branch of a tree you feed that to the goats because you want milk and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:19">1:08:19-1:08:24</a>:</strong>  meat from the goats right well then what do you do with the manure and the urine from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:24">1:08:24-1:08:28</a>:</strong>  the goats well that material now should go back to where it came from I mean that's the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:28">1:08:28-1:08:35</a>:</strong>  ideal cycle or that you feed those goats in a where you do the feeding of those branches<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:35">1:08:35-1:08:41</a>:</strong>  and leaves to those goats that the goats I don't always stay in the same place they rotate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:41">1:08:41-1:08:47</a>:</strong>  around so that the those minerals that are cycled through the goat get cycled across<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:47">1:08:47-1:08:53</a>:</strong>  the board but that you also try and maintain a hundred percent ground cover a hundred percent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:08:53">1:08:53-1:09:01</a>:</strong>  of the time with either the residues of plants or plants themselves such that the soil is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:01">1:09:01-1:09:14</a>:</strong>  protected and organic material on the soil whether it's living or non-living is the skin<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:14">1:09:14-1:09:22</a>:</strong>  of the soil of the main mineral part of the soil so if you take that away then it becomes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:22">1:09:22-1:09:28</a>:</strong>  horribly exposed and if you're in the tropics that's even more enhanced because you've got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:28">1:09:28-1:09:35</a>:</strong>  warm corrosive rainfall and erosive rainfall and you've got really really strong sunlight<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:35">1:09:35-1:09:42</a>:</strong>  so so you really want to make sure that that skin is not exposed because if it is you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:42">1:09:42-1:09:48</a>:</strong>  going to lose things really quickly so having adequate levels of shade of the soil surface<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:48">1:09:48-1:09:54</a>:</strong>  by managing implant communities from your non-woodies right up to your woodies is really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:54">1:09:54-1:09:58</a>:</strong>  important and then when you're out in the areas which are more range type country where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:09:58">1:09:58-1:10:06</a>:</strong>  your trees woody plants are more of a less density a lesser density and you are looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:06">1:10:06-1:10:13</a>:</strong>  at management of grasses and whatnot it's basically the same principles try and promote<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:13">1:10:13-1:10:24</a>:</strong>  the the the bio mimicked rotation of animals through using a planned grazing regime and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:24">1:10:24-1:10:31</a>:</strong>  try and maintain a permanent cover of of the soil with lit with the litter of the plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:31">1:10:31-1:10:37</a>:</strong>  you're growing and the plants themselves and and that's that's basically what you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:37">1:10:37-1:10:44</a>:</strong>  to do the rest of it will take care of itself which is which is a great thing I mean it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:44">1:10:44-1:10:48</a>:</strong>  planets that's what you want that's what you're trying to work towards so that's our inputs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:48">1:10:48-1:10:56</a>:</strong>  are no longer necessary for the this is regenerate and develop itself yeah it just becomes management<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:10:56">1:10:56-1:11:03</a>:</strong>  and you know unfortunately we've stuffed up so many ecologies by taking apex predators<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:03">1:11:03-1:11:14</a>:</strong>  out of the system is and you know destroying so many large herds not hurting animals and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:14">1:11:14-1:11:20</a>:</strong>  their predators we've taken those out of the system we fenced we've rode it you know we've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:20">1:11:20-1:11:24</a>:</strong>  done all sorts of stuff to this planet I mean we you know there's never been a more powerful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:24">1:11:24-1:11:33</a>:</strong>  species than us and and so you know we've got it we've you can't just say well we'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:33">1:11:33-1:11:38</a>:</strong>  just leave it alone we've actually you know to an extent you can do that in the humid<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:38">1:11:38-1:11:46</a>:</strong>  tropics because it will take care of itself because of the the provenance of humidity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:46">1:11:46-1:11:50</a>:</strong>  because it has a potential to to regenerate much faster because of the resources that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:50">1:11:50-1:11:54</a>:</strong>  are constantly being put in the system yeah exactly because of water it's just humidity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:11:54">1:11:54-1:12:02</a>:</strong>  it's as Savory puts it's a non-brittle landscape so if you're in a non-brittle which also happens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:02">1:12:02-1:12:06</a>:</strong>  in the cooler climates as well then you can just walk away and nature will take care of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:06">1:12:06-1:12:12</a>:</strong>  itself but if you're in those areas where you're sub-humid so-called brittle landscapes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:12">1:12:12-1:12:20</a>:</strong>  will you will just by by walking away and not not being involved in management then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:20">1:12:20-1:12:26</a>:</strong>  you will get desertification so yeah people say oh well you get all these you get all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:26">1:12:26-1:12:31</a>:</strong>  these woody plants appear and you know it seems like there's a lot going on but go and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:31">1:12:31-1:12:35</a>:</strong>  look at the soil surface is there any soil actually being formed in those systems and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:35">1:12:35-1:12:41</a>:</strong>  the answer is generally no it's not what are the rates of runoff this you know look at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:41">1:12:41-1:12:46</a>:</strong>  look at the levels of groundwater that's in those systems where there's there's takeover<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:46">1:12:46-1:12:58</a>:</strong>  by often spiny low low high toxicity woody plant systems you know there's very little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:12:58">1:12:58-1:13:05</a>:</strong>  soil cover a lot of these systems are quite fire prone and for or pyrophilic so they and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:05">1:13:05-1:13:13</a>:</strong>  on it goes so now I think we do need to interact and I think it's part of our responsibility<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:13">1:13:13-1:13:17</a>:</strong>  following all of the degradation that we've caused.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:17">1:13:17-1:13:22</a>:</strong>  There you have it so tell me now what are some resources that you recommend to people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:22">1:13:22-1:13:26</a>:</strong>  who want to learn more about this either about land-based projects or any other form of regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:26">1:13:26-1:13:27</a>:</strong>  development?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:27">1:13:27-1:13:35</a>:</strong>  Well I'll speak selfishly we with the Regrarians Limited non-profit we were about to launch<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:35">1:13:35-1:13:41</a>:</strong>  a whole range of different online trainings which people will be able to hear about in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:41">1:13:41-1:13:48</a>:</strong>  the coming weeks so keep an eye out on that at our Facebook presence at Regrarians Facebook<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:48">1:13:48-1:13:56</a>:</strong>  page or on the Regrarians.org website become a subscriber and you'll find out more about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:13:56">1:13:56-1:14:05</a>:</strong>  that so we'll be taking people through whole programs online just as an aside when we came<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:05">1:14:05-1:14:12</a>:</strong>  back from last year's tour we Lisa and myself took on the full-time caring position of Lisa's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:12">1:14:12-1:14:17</a>:</strong>  94 year old mother the grandfather and grandmother of our children so we live in a house and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:17">1:14:17-1:14:25</a>:</strong>  we're her carer so my touring days is such a I've been put on hold as well we we had<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:25">1:14:25-1:14:26</a>:</strong>  to take that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:26">1:14:26-1:14:27</a>:</strong>  That's understandable sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:27">1:14:27-1:14:31</a>:</strong>  Yeah which is great and when we it's it's actually refreshing to not be on tour all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:31">1:14:31-1:14:37</a>:</strong>  the time so but we still we still need to get our energy flowing and so online training<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:37">1:14:37-1:14:40</a>:</strong>  is something that we'll be doing to help people with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:40">1:14:40-1:14:41</a>:</strong>  Really?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:41">1:14:41-1:14:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah which is we're really looking forward to and we've worked hard on planning otherwise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:47">1:14:47-1:14:54</a>:</strong>  the Regrarians Handbook which is under development that's that's a sort of I would say it's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:14:54">1:14:54-1:15:00</a>:</strong>  place where a lot of these concepts are brought together but then otherwise look at holistic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:00">1:15:00-1:15:07</a>:</strong>  management and the work that the Savory Institute and also holistic management international<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:07">1:15:07-1:15:11</a>:</strong>  I'd look at Regeneration International they're a really great organization who have a base<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:11">1:15:11-1:15:17</a>:</strong>  in Mexico and elsewhere but particularly out of Mexico and Alex and whole team of people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:17">1:15:17-1:15:23</a>:</strong>  there doing a great job I'd also look at the permaculture movement more broadly there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:23">1:15:23-1:15:29</a>:</strong>  people there who are doing really great work particularly people like Eric Olson at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:29">1:15:29-1:15:35</a>:</strong>  permaculture skills center that those guys are stellar operators there's a few others<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:35">1:15:35-1:15:39</a>:</strong>  about who I should mention that I can't remember off the top of my head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:39">1:15:39-1:15:44</a>:</strong>  No worries if it comes to you just let me know send me an email or something all of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:44">1:15:44-1:15:47</a>:</strong>  these links that you're talking about now I'll put up in the show notes for everyone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:47">1:15:47-1:15:48</a>:</strong>  to find easily.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:48">1:15:48-1:15:52</a>:</strong>  There's an unprecedented amount of information I think that's a part of the burden that people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:15:52">1:15:52-1:16:00</a>:</strong>  have is you know how do I pull all of this together and we we think that the regrarian's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:00">1:16:00-1:16:05</a>:</strong>  platform is a really good clearinghouse for that in that at least it gives everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:05">1:16:05-1:16:08</a>:</strong>  a title.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:08">1:16:08-1:16:13</a>:</strong>  So I look at the regrarians like I use the regrarians platform to catalog my books it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:13">1:16:13-1:16:22</a>:</strong>  my Dewey system on my library it's how I it's how I file all of my files now so it gives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:22">1:16:22-1:16:28</a>:</strong>  things a place and it also gives things of priority so I think Mr. Yeomans did us all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:28">1:16:28-1:16:33</a>:</strong>  a great service with the development of the keyline scale of permanence of all things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:33">1:16:33-1:16:39</a>:</strong>  agricultural and I'd highly recommend people have a read of his works and yeah and listen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:39">1:16:39-1:16:42</a>:</strong>  to podcast podcast thing is fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:42">1:16:42-1:16:50</a>:</strong>  You know I if I'm not listening to the to ABC radio when I'm driving around places I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:50">1:16:50-1:16:55</a>:</strong>  put on podcasts and listen to the likes of yourself Oliver and a whole host of other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:16:55">1:16:55-1:17:00</a>:</strong>  people and just take in what's going on and give yourself the time realize that there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:00">1:17:00-1:17:07</a>:</strong>  probably is enough time and that you owe it to yourselves and your families and the ecosystems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:07">1:17:07-1:17:15</a>:</strong>  that you manage to take the right amount of time to to put more emphasis on the management<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:15">1:17:15-1:17:20</a>:</strong>  of those systems than the development because you can spend an awful amount of energy and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:20">1:17:20-1:17:25</a>:</strong>  investment on developing things without focusing on on something that's really important and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:25">1:17:25-1:17:27</a>:</strong>  that's their management.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:27">1:17:27-1:17:32</a>:</strong>  I'm so glad you said that something I really like to try and put focus on as well usually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:32">1:17:32-1:17:36</a>:</strong>  the development is the really sexy part and people often lose interest or don't have the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:36">1:17:36-1:17:42</a>:</strong>  staying power to keep those systems maintained but that's really where they make the shift<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:42">1:17:42-1:17:46</a>:</strong>  after you know usually the first couple of years of development and maintenance that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:46">1:17:46-1:17:51</a>:</strong>  they start to work on their own and really start to turn a corner where the outputs are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:51">1:17:51-1:17:54</a>:</strong>  much much greater than the inputs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:17:54">1:17:54-1:18:00</a>:</strong>  Yeah and where you shift we shift your regime of innovation so you shift from being an innovator<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:00">1:18:00-1:18:06</a>:</strong>  in installation to an innovator of the outputs of that of that installation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:06">1:18:06-1:18:08</a>:</strong>  So true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:08">1:18:08-1:18:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah and we I came up with a thing last year just in riffing that we that we have that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:15">1:18:15-1:18:21</a>:</strong>  most people are engaged in what we call big M management and not and small D sorry big<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:21">1:18:21-1:18:28</a>:</strong>  D development and small M management when actually what we should be doing is how is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:28">1:18:28-1:18:33</a>:</strong>  we should have a big M management approach and a small D development and I think a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:33">1:18:33-1:18:37</a>:</strong>  of people would find value in following that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:37">1:18:37-1:18:38</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:38">1:18:38-1:18:42</a>:</strong>  Well hey Darren thank you so much for taking the time today and sharing those resources<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:42">1:18:42-1:18:43</a>:</strong>  with us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:43">1:18:43-1:18:47</a>:</strong>  I really hope that we can do a follow up with this sometime I know I have a ton more questions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:47">1:18:47-1:18:49</a>:</strong>  that I'd love to ask you at some point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:49">1:18:49-1:18:53</a>:</strong>  Your work has been a real influence on what I do and so many of my friends as well were<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:53">1:18:53-1:18:55</a>:</strong>  very excited that I had the opportunity to speak to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:55">1:18:55-1:18:57</a>:</strong>  So again thank you for your time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:18:57">1:18:57-1:19:04</a>:</strong>  That's really nice and it's lovely to hear those tones of Mother's Day in your village<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:04">1:19:04-1:19:06</a>:</strong>  in Guatemala in the background.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:06">1:19:06-1:19:08</a>:</strong>  That's lovely the fireworks stayed away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:08">1:19:08-1:19:11</a>:</strong>  We were fortunate with that right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:11">1:19:11-1:19:15</a>:</strong>  The music stayed at least nice enough that we could continue with the interview.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:15">1:19:15-1:19:17</a>:</strong>  It's nice to have a little bang.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:17">1:19:17-1:19:19</a>:</strong>  It added some flavor right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:19">1:19:19-1:19:21</a>:</strong>  Yeah there you go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:21">1:19:21-1:19:23</a>:</strong>  All right well thank you so much and thanks for your really great questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:23">1:19:23-1:19:26</a>:</strong>  It has been my pleasure thanks for making the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:26">1:19:26-1:19:27</a>:</strong>  Take care Darren.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:27">1:19:27-1:19:29</a>:</strong>  All right all the best.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:29">1:19:29-1:19:30</a>:</strong>  There you have it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:30">1:19:30-1:19:35</a>:</strong>  Now I know that was a marathon talk but let's jump right into this session's weekly tip.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:35">1:19:35-1:19:38</a>:</strong>  Now I know this was a point that both Darren and I made earlier in the talk but it's important<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:38">1:19:38-1:19:43</a>:</strong>  enough that I wanted to repeat it and explain a little more in this section.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:43">1:19:43-1:19:45</a>:</strong>  Of course I'm talking about maintenance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:45">1:19:45-1:19:50</a>:</strong>  Everyone gets really excited and enthusiastic about the design process and implementation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:50">1:19:50-1:19:54</a>:</strong>  of a new project because that's when you get to do all the dreaming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:54">1:19:54-1:19:57</a>:</strong>  That's the part when you can envision this grand future for how you're going to create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:19:57">1:19:57-1:20:02</a>:</strong>  an epic landscape and produce tons of food and house all sorts of wildlife all while<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:02">1:20:02-1:20:07</a>:</strong>  building tons of soil and all that really good stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:07">1:20:07-1:20:08</a>:</strong>  Now there's nothing at all wrong with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:08">1:20:08-1:20:11</a>:</strong>  I love this part of the project as much as anyone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:11">1:20:11-1:20:15</a>:</strong>  But here's where I offer a little caution and forethought.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:15">1:20:15-1:20:19</a>:</strong>  During this process make sure that you plan for maintenance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:19">1:20:19-1:20:23</a>:</strong>  Plan for maintaining all the systems and features that you put in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:23">1:20:23-1:20:28</a>:</strong>  The truth is that having an annual garden or raising animals is incredibly rewarding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:28">1:20:28-1:20:31</a>:</strong>  but it requires a lot of consistent input.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:31">1:20:31-1:20:35</a>:</strong>  Now these are the less sexy parts of having a regenerative lifestyle, especially in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:35">1:20:35-1:20:40</a>:</strong>  first few years when your ecosystem is still young and getting established and hasn't yet<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:40">1:20:40-1:20:43</a>:</strong>  reached the point where it can take much care of itself yet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:43">1:20:43-1:20:47</a>:</strong>  Just remember that this is a lifestyle choice and there are some compromises that come along<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:47">1:20:47-1:20:48</a>:</strong>  with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:48">1:20:48-1:20:52</a>:</strong>  If you commit to having a mini farm or growing a lot of plants in your house, you're going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:52">1:20:52-1:20:54</a>:</strong>  to need to care for them regularly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:54">1:20:54-1:20:59</a>:</strong>  Many people find that it's hard to travel or be away from home for more than a day and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:20:59">1:20:59-1:21:03</a>:</strong>  sometimes not even that long if you don't have someone who can come around and take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:03">1:21:03-1:21:05</a>:</strong>  care of your systems for you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:05">1:21:05-1:21:10</a>:</strong>  Now this isn't meant to be discouraging at all, just as a way of helping all of you get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:10">1:21:10-1:21:15</a>:</strong>  the most realistic idea of the lifestyle that you're creating and there are a lot of ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:15">1:21:15-1:21:19</a>:</strong>  to make this process more manageable and simple to maintain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:19">1:21:19-1:21:25</a>:</strong>  One of the easiest ways is to schedule regular tasks ahead of time in your calendar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:25">1:21:25-1:21:30</a>:</strong>  Things like garden harvesting times, crop rotation and planting, even tool maintenance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:30">1:21:30-1:21:34</a>:</strong>  is much more likely to get done if you take the time to make a schedule at the beginning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:34">1:21:34-1:21:39</a>:</strong>  of the season so that you're not always worried if you've forgotten the tasks that don't happen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:39">1:21:39-1:21:44</a>:</strong>  on a regular or daily basis, but that are important to making your design work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:44">1:21:44-1:21:49</a>:</strong>  I personally like using Google Calendar because I can set it up so that it sends me alerts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:49">1:21:49-1:21:53</a>:</strong>  in advance and that way I can prepare for what's coming up ahead of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:53">1:21:53-1:21:57</a>:</strong>  So once you get settled into your maintenance routines, these things will become automatic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:57">1:21:57-1:21:59</a>:</strong>  and they'll get easier and easier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:21:59">1:21:59-1:22:04</a>:</strong>  Just remember that developing a truly regenerative home and life is a long-term project and it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:04">1:22:04-1:22:09</a>:</strong>  takes all the little unseen steps along the way to achieve those beautiful after pictures<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-darrendoherty/#t=1:22:09">1:22:09-1:22:13</a>:</strong>  that seduce us into getting started in the first place.<br />
