<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:06</a>:</strong>  Natalie, first of all, thank you so much for taking the time to be here this morning.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:17">0:04:17-0:04:21</a>:</strong>  I know it wasn't your original intention to start teaching permaculture and ecosystem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:21">0:04:21-0:04:23</a>:</strong>  restoration communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:23">0:04:23-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  Well, thanks, Oliver, and thanks also to Zach and Riley.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:33</a>:</strong>  There was really a positive response from that webinar, so I'm glad that people got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:33">0:04:33-0:04:37</a>:</strong>  to get some more insight on the work that's being done here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:37">0:04:37-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  So as I just was mentioning to you before we started recording, I came here to work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:47</a>:</strong>  in South Sudan in 2005 to work on post-war town planning and reconstruction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:04:52</a>:</strong>  And so I don't actually view what I'm doing now as different than that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:52">0:04:52-0:04:54</a>:</strong>  It's all part of the same picture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:54">0:04:54-0:04:59</a>:</strong>  It just has become more and more comprehensive as I'm always looking at addressing the root<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:04:59">0:04:59-0:05:00</a>:</strong>  causes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:00">0:05:00-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  I've been in the humanitarian sector for seven, actually 20 years now, because even before<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  coming to Africa, I was seconded to FEMA to work on hurricane disaster recovery in Florida<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:15</a>:</strong>  the year before Hurricane Katrina.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:15">0:05:15-0:05:18</a>:</strong>  So I came to South Sudan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:18">0:05:18-0:05:23</a>:</strong>  I was working in this post-war environment where there were huge amounts of needs, including<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:23">0:05:23-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  the need to create space and land for all of the returnees, the returning refugees that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:31">0:05:31-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  were going to be returning to South Sudan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:38</a>:</strong>  So we were working with all the 10 state capitals as they were establishing themselves as state<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:38">0:05:38-0:05:39</a>:</strong>  capitals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:39">0:05:39-0:05:42</a>:</strong>  There was a lot of infrastructure going on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:42">0:05:42-0:05:47</a>:</strong>  And then these human beings who were coming in who didn't have services, South Sudan was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:47">0:05:47-0:05:48</a>:</strong>  at that time just Southern Sudan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:48">0:05:48-0:05:51</a>:</strong>  It was the lower half of the whole of Sudan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:51">0:05:51-0:05:54</a>:</strong>  So people needed food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:54">0:05:54-0:05:55</a>:</strong>  They needed water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:55">0:05:55-0:05:56</a>:</strong>  They needed shelter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:05:56">0:05:56-0:06:00</a>:</strong>  They're coming home after decades of war.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:00">0:06:00-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  And there were a lot of problems in the context at that time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:07</a>:</strong>  Drought and flood were there 20 years ago, 17 years ago when I got there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:07">0:06:07-0:06:15</a>:</strong>  And I just couldn't accept that this humanitarian emergency crisis response is the long-term<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:15">0:06:15-0:06:20</a>:</strong>  solution because why would anyone accept that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:20">0:06:20-0:06:25</a>:</strong>  So I just started to think, why do we have six months of water and six months of drought?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:25">0:06:25-0:06:29</a>:</strong>  Like, there's got to be a design question in here somehow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:29">0:06:29-0:06:36</a>:</strong>  And so that's when I learned about permaculture as an ideology and systems-based science when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:36">0:06:36-0:06:43</a>:</strong>  I was in college, which was like 1990, I think between 1998 and 2000 was when I learned about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:43">0:06:43-0:06:46</a>:</strong>  it from my Brazilian roommate who's an anthropologist.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:46">0:06:46-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  And when she described it to me, I had such a clear picture of what she was talking about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:53</a>:</strong>  and the systemic interconnectedness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:53">0:06:53-0:06:58</a>:</strong>  And so I sort of imbibed that in my journey in working in East Africa and tried to bring<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:06:58">0:06:58-0:07:01</a>:</strong>  those concepts to my work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:01">0:07:01-0:07:05</a>:</strong>  So the design, the solution-based approaches.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:05">0:07:05-0:07:06</a>:</strong>  Okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:06">0:07:06-0:07:11</a>:</strong>  So you used permaculture and I'm sure a lot of other learnings as additional tools to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:11">0:07:11-0:07:17</a>:</strong>  the original intention of helping people to rebuild after either catastrophe or displacement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:17">0:07:17-0:07:20</a>:</strong>  And how did you start in that career path in the first place?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:20">0:07:20-0:07:24</a>:</strong>  What was your studies and what was the connections that led you to that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:24">0:07:24-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  Well, so I don't even refer that often to permaculture because it's so all encompassing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:35</a>:</strong>  for me and people within our community and the regenerative community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:35">0:07:35-0:07:36</a>:</strong>  Permaculture is everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:36">0:07:36-0:07:39</a>:</strong>  It's natural building, it's fermenting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:39">0:07:39-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  So what took me on this path was first of all, when I was working in DC, I was working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:54</a>:</strong>  for a very large scale private firm, a globally renowned design firm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:54">0:07:54-0:07:57</a>:</strong>  But they were dealing with more municipal level interventions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:07:57">0:07:57-0:08:02</a>:</strong>  If it had to do with community development or minority communities, they were like, Topa,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:02">0:08:02-0:08:08</a>:</strong>  you're going to Southeast DC tonight or whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:08">0:08:08-0:08:18</a>:</strong>  I always was driven by my ethics and a sense of social justice and all types of justice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:18">0:08:18-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  And that includes ecological justice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:26</a>:</strong>  So when I came to South Sudan, I just started to see a lot of opportunities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:26">0:08:26-0:08:31</a>:</strong>  And I could sense even though at that time, 17 years ago, I may not have been as conversant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:31">0:08:31-0:08:34</a>:</strong>  in the issues of soil and degradation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:34">0:08:34-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  I was seeing it happen all around me and it became very instinctual that something not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:41</a>:</strong>  good is happening and something is collapsing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:41">0:08:41-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  I could see that in the landscape.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:47</a>:</strong>  To back up a little bit, I also come from an immigrant family.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:47">0:08:47-0:08:53</a>:</strong>  My mother is from Poland, from Novotad, not far from Zakopane.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:08:53">0:08:53-0:09:00</a>:</strong>  And then my biological father was a refugee from Ukraine, whose family got asylum in Brazil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:00">0:09:00-0:09:02</a>:</strong>  and he grew up in Rio.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:02">0:09:02-0:09:09</a>:</strong>  But then the person who raised me like a father was also a UNHCR registered refugee who left<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:09">0:09:09-0:09:11</a>:</strong>  Poland to Germany.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:11">0:09:11-0:09:17</a>:</strong>  And so when we came to the US, the way that we connected with our culture, even though<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:17">0:09:17-0:09:24</a>:</strong>  I was born in the US, but my heritage security relied on the relationship we had with nature<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  and food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:31</a>:</strong>  So we were doing a lot of wild forageology, though it wasn't called that at the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:31">0:09:31-0:09:38</a>:</strong>  But we would go and fish for crawdads and go fishing and pick mushrooms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:38">0:09:38-0:09:43</a>:</strong>  And so having that relationship with my ecological surroundings was a really big foundation for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:43">0:09:43-0:09:44</a>:</strong>  me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:44">0:09:44-0:09:52</a>:</strong>  And then coming into the space of moving forward back into South Sudan, I just started to understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:09:52">0:09:52-0:09:55</a>:</strong>  that food security was a very huge issue.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:55</a>:</strong>  ecology, displacement, the humanitarian context.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:11:30">0:11:30-0:11:36</a>:</strong>  who's been a mentor and a partner and a co trainer now and, you know, continues to be<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:14:04">0:14:04-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  Soil loss, soil loss, that is the big one.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:39</a>:</strong>  Those are definitely the main root causes.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:26</a>:</strong>  No, no, that's a fantastic way of laying it out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:26">0:18:26-0:18:31</a>:</strong>  And much like you said at the beginning, it's often glossed over even from people who are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:31">0:18:31-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  trying to work in our space as, oh, it's climate change, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:35</a>:</strong>  Things are changing.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:18:41">0:18:41-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  Whereas so much of your work and so many other examples from that area can show what is possible<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:01">0:19:01-0:19:08</a>:</strong>  I also wanted to add another root cause is our global economic system and the prioritization<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:27</a>:</strong>  How do we do resource recovery and give any extracted resources additional spins on the<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:19:45">0:19:45-0:19:50</a>:</strong>  We can't separate that out from the conversation because we can't have ecological justice until<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:31">0:20:31-0:20:34</a>:</strong>  very recent years, but also stemming back to colonialism.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:47">0:20:47-0:20:52</a>:</strong>  touch on this, is that food used to be the domain of women, okay?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:52">0:20:52-0:20:59</a>:</strong>  Women grew the food, there was their teeny little fingers, they selected the best seeds,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:20:59">0:20:59-0:21:04</a>:</strong>  everything around food production and cooking and the home and the kitchen and saving of<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:15</a>:</strong>  And when we really started to poop the bed was when there was this wholesale masculinization<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:15">0:21:15-0:21:16</a>:</strong>  of food systems.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:21:30">0:21:30-0:21:35</a>:</strong>  East Africa, you know, thank God there are, or whoever, thank goodness that there are<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:44">0:37:44-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  So last week I was in South Sudan in a very flooded place, looking at flood zone food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  systems.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:57">0:37:57-0:37:59</a>:</strong>  Every step of the way, we're co designing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:37:59">0:37:59-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  I'm asking, how do you do this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  How do you, if you want to tie together bamboos, what do you use?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:06</a>:</strong>  They use mosquito nets that they shred.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:06">0:38:06-0:38:07</a>:</strong>  They work super well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:07">0:38:07-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  So we created bamboo rafts for floating gardens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:16</a>:</strong>  We also made a chinampa, like the Aztec chinampa.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:16">0:38:16-0:38:17</a>:</strong>  And that was totally co designed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:17">0:38:17-0:38:22</a>:</strong>  Like once I sense that somebody is a champion, I'm like, I keep seeking myself for champions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:22">0:38:22-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  If I figure out that somebody is like really interested in taking a lot of pride in their<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:32</a>:</strong>  I'm like, all right, you're the captain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:32">0:38:32-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  Like you go like you own this and let me just try to ask questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:42</a>:</strong>  So the chinampa, at first we talked about making it four by eight feet or four by six,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:42">0:38:42-0:38:44</a>:</strong>  I mean, not feet meters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:44">0:38:44-0:38:49</a>:</strong>  But then I'm asking, well, with this black cotton soil and all this clay, if the edges<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:49">0:38:49-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  erode, then what?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  And they're like, okay, well, yeah, you're right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:38:53</a>:</strong>  Let's make it bigger.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:53">0:38:53-0:38:59</a>:</strong>  So the whole time, we're just engineering and designing the things together, asking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:38:59">0:38:59-0:39:00</a>:</strong>  each other questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:00">0:39:00-0:39:04</a>:</strong>  We're all students, we are all teachers, and we come together and we're just going to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:04">0:39:04-0:39:06</a>:</strong>  a thing and see if it works and test.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:06">0:39:06-0:39:08</a>:</strong>  So laboratory in that regard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:08">0:39:08-0:39:12</a>:</strong>  Like these were some new things that we're trying to develop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:12">0:39:12-0:39:17</a>:</strong>  So it depends on the context, but I am brought in from the like kind of top down situation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:17">0:39:17-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  if I'm coming in through a huge NGO or the UN.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  But I think for people who are trying to come into the space, I'm not even sure like, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  I would do is you have to figure out who are the green local champions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:39</a>:</strong>  I do have the privilege that I get these opportunities to talk with Oliver and other people, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:39">0:39:39-0:39:44</a>:</strong>  there really are amazing champions here from East Africa.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:44">0:39:44-0:39:48</a>:</strong>  And so we have to be raising those green local voices.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:48">0:39:48-0:39:53</a>:</strong>  And again, that's a moving bus to jump on to figure out who are the champions who are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:53">0:39:53-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  actually doing accountable work, okay?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:40:02</a>:</strong>  If they're given money, can show you like, these are receipts, this is what we spent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:02">0:40:02-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  And there's really a lot of transparency and accountability, but people who you can really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  see are really trying to do something and they just need a bit of support rather than<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:17</a>:</strong>  people who have some grandiose vision and they're trying, or they talk a lot and it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:17">0:40:17-0:40:21</a>:</strong>  not really clear what they achieve on the ground, but they're asking for money a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:21">0:40:21-0:40:26</a>:</strong>  So those are the kinds of dynamics that I would be looking for if I were trying to do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:26">0:40:26-0:40:28</a>:</strong>  a project in a country that's not mine.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:35">0:40:35-0:40:39</a>:</strong>  eyes and one mouth, two ears, use them proportionally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:39">0:40:39-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  I've always liked that one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  And I would imagine too, that working with diverse communities, especially ones that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:58</a>:</strong>  are recently superimposed upon existing communities, dealing with the conflicts and the viewpoints,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:40:58">0:40:58-0:41:04</a>:</strong>  the things that disrupt cohesion, getting a consensus, getting people to work together<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:04">0:41:04-0:41:10</a>:</strong>  is probably one of the original hurdles that you have to get over.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:10">0:41:10-0:41:15</a>:</strong>  And I'm wondering how you work with the members of different communities to try and get a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:15">0:41:15-0:41:19</a>:</strong>  consensus and get them rowing in the same direction, because it's essential for things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:19">0:41:19-0:41:24</a>:</strong>  to work and for things to remain viable once you're gone and in the long term.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:24">0:41:24-0:41:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:25">0:41:25-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  So as of coming back to the story of place, I mean, I'm just there to listen and learn,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  and there's not really a need to build consensus because they're sharing their story and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:39</a>:</strong>  share out like, you know, people will say in this community, we used to have a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:39">0:41:39-0:41:44</a>:</strong>  trees everywhere and water was cleaner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:44">0:41:44-0:41:45</a>:</strong>  Animals were healthier.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:45">0:41:45-0:41:47</a>:</strong>  Humans had more food and health.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:47">0:41:47-0:41:49</a>:</strong>  Animals had more food and health.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:41:51">0:41:51-0:41:53</a>:</strong>  Now we have disasters.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:05">0:42:05-0:42:08</a>:</strong>  And so like that doesn't take convincing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:08">0:42:08-0:42:12</a>:</strong>  And it's not my job to convince.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:12">0:42:12-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  They are very articulate and able to spell out what the challenges are that they have,<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:22">0:42:22-0:42:28</a>:</strong>  So again, I'm not trying to come with I don't even really have like a curriculum.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:42:44">0:42:44-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  together and problem solving based on our experiential capital and our educational capital<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:37</a>:</strong>  I told the team very clearly I can figure out the physics and the biology like we can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:43:37">0:43:37-0:43:40</a>:</strong>  make it float and make it grow food.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:00">0:44:00-0:44:05</a>:</strong>  I'm usually the only or if Warren's with me, we're the only sort of people from outside.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:07">0:44:07-0:44:12</a>:</strong>  We also have other like African staff from other neighboring countries.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:44:37">0:44:37-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  we did that project, we had a very mixed community.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:00">0:45:00-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  My grandfather used to do this or this is how my grandmother I remember her burying<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:13">0:45:13-0:45:14</a>:</strong>  This is simple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:14">0:45:14-0:45:16</a>:</strong>  This is self-reliance.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:24</a>:</strong>  I talked about the Quran.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:24">0:45:24-0:45:28</a>:</strong>  Let's build Quranic nurseries and Quranic food for us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:28">0:45:28-0:45:33</a>:</strong>  You know, like whatever is listed in the Quran, like wavas and pomegranates and apricots and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:33">0:45:33-0:45:37</a>:</strong>  almonds, everything, all those things, they will grow in Yemen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:37">0:45:37-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  OK, so people really loved that same in Somalia, same kind of climate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:44</a>:</strong>  So they're like, what I are, holy Quran is going to make us resilient.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:45:49</a>:</strong>  And so it's just a matter of trying to understand what you know, what people value and how can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:49">0:45:49-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  we help to explain things in a way that really makes sense in their context and meeting people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:56</a>:</strong>  where they are.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:46:05</a>:</strong>  And I like what you were talking about as well, of creating small, fast feedback loop<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:05">0:46:05-0:46:10</a>:</strong>  projects that you can gain new information from, especially when you're new to a place.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:14">0:46:14-0:46:20</a>:</strong>  episode was that there is sort of an assumption if you haven't worked with these communities,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:20">0:46:20-0:46:29</a>:</strong>  that there's a whole bunch of latent and dormant information, knowledge of the land, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:29">0:46:29-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  all these things that have been passed down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  Whereas in a lot of cases, this isn't the case anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:40</a>:</strong>  That knowledge has been broken through bad information, colonialization, loss over generations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:40">0:46:40-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  through displacement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:47</a>:</strong>  And though they may have a sense of what can work and something in their memory of how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:47">0:46:47-0:46:52</a>:</strong>  their their ancestors used to do it, it doesn't necessarily match with what they've been taught<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:52">0:46:52-0:46:53</a>:</strong>  up until that point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:46:53">0:46:53-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  And so finding a way of connecting with the familiar and the indigenous knowledge, while<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:04</a>:</strong>  also bringing in new ideas that can help make that bridge and apply it in a more modern<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:04">0:47:04-0:47:11</a>:</strong>  or local context, and then applying it and testing it in small, manageable sizes that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:11">0:47:11-0:47:14</a>:</strong>  are low risk, don't require a lot of investment.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:19">0:47:19-0:47:20</a>:</strong>  places?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:20">0:47:20-0:47:21</a>:</strong>  Oh, it depends.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:21">0:47:21-0:47:27</a>:</strong>  I mean, there's so many different actors working on so many different types of scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:27">0:47:27-0:47:31</a>:</strong>  But yeah, there is a lot for all of us, there's a lot of unlearning that needs to happen,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:31">0:47:31-0:47:32</a>:</strong>  right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:32">0:47:32-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah, we have been really hardwired and programmed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  And I mean, there are reasons for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:44</a>:</strong>  Food is something you're supposed to buy, not care about how it's produced.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:44">0:47:44-0:47:50</a>:</strong>  And so I mean, whether I'm in Turkana, Kenya, or I'm in Oklahoma, like people have received<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:50">0:47:50-0:47:53</a>:</strong>  wrong information for a reason, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:53">0:47:53-0:47:57</a>:</strong>  There are special interests behind what you know, you always have to ask, in whose interest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:47:57">0:47:57-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  is it that I am learning the things the way that I'm learning them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:06</a>:</strong>  And so, but, you know, as Warren always says, and we always say in our trainings is three<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:06">0:48:06-0:48:13</a>:</strong>  ways to get people to get on board and, you know, be really persuaded into your approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:13">0:48:13-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  Number one is the, you know, maybe the most important and that is demonstration, people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:25</a>:</strong>  will only believe what they can see with their real eyes, unless it's religious, but then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:25">0:48:25-0:48:28</a>:</strong>  number two is demonstration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:28">0:48:28-0:48:33</a>:</strong>  Okay, that is the way that people are going to see it, believe it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:33">0:48:33-0:48:35</a>:</strong>  And number three, of course, is demonstration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:35">0:48:35-0:48:41</a>:</strong>  So demonstration, demonstration, demonstration, you can talk all day long, and you can tell<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:41">0:48:41-0:48:46</a>:</strong>  people that chemicals are bad, you can talk about the, you know, GMOs, you can do a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:46">0:48:46-0:48:47</a>:</strong>  of talking.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:47">0:48:47-0:48:54</a>:</strong>  But what we do is like the first thing we do is we make two little side by side miniature<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:54">0:48:54-0:48:56</a>:</strong>  farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:56">0:48:56-0:48:59</a>:</strong>  And I even use, you know, like little tools.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:48:59">0:48:59-0:49:04</a>:</strong>  But you know, we will make like little miniature a frame.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:04">0:49:04-0:49:07</a>:</strong>  This is actually from this one is from Burundi.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:07">0:49:07-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  So we made a little miniature farm side by side too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:14</a>:</strong>  And so like, one will be like, Oh, this is Oliver's farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:14">0:49:14-0:49:17</a>:</strong>  And Oliver just spends all day drinking tea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:17">0:49:17-0:49:21</a>:</strong>  And then he doesn't pay attention to the land and soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:21">0:49:21-0:49:26</a>:</strong>  And he comes and tills all the land and sweeps up all the organic matter and then burns it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:26">0:49:26-0:49:30</a>:</strong>  And we actually take a pile of leaves and set it on fire.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:30">0:49:30-0:49:32</a>:</strong>  And then Oh, here's Natalie's farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:32">0:49:32-0:49:33</a>:</strong>  She's resilient.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:33">0:49:33-0:49:39</a>:</strong>  And she and we make little we take this little miniature a frame, we make little swales,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:39">0:49:39-0:49:44</a>:</strong>  we do some stone mulching, we plant little trees, this is a tiny little model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:49:44">0:49:44-0:49:46</a>:</strong>  And then we cover the whole thing with mulch.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:52:48">0:52:48-0:52:51</a>:</strong>  You can't just do this in a conference hall, right?<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:16">0:54:16-0:54:21</a>:</strong>  It's still an and I think the regenerative movement altogether, there's still a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:21">0:54:21-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  laboratory happening and building of evidence base.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:28</a>:</strong>  Like, I think that's one of the major challenges is how do we battle with information?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:28">0:54:28-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  So, you know, if you're working with a community, whether that's in your own hometown or elsewhere,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:42</a>:</strong>  people don't understand the science and it's not always intuitive for them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:42">0:54:42-0:54:48</a>:</strong>  So following up, continue to repeat a lot of simple, basic ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:48">0:54:48-0:54:49</a>:</strong>  Keep it simple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:49">0:54:49-0:54:51</a>:</strong>  I would say try to keep it simple.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:51">0:54:51-0:54:57</a>:</strong>  I say here, like here we throughout East Africa, people eat a sort of a maize meal, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:54:57">0:54:57-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  called either ugali or pochon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:05</a>:</strong>  And that's like a big staple that every a lot of communities eat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:05">0:55:05-0:55:10</a>:</strong>  So I always tell them the soil is a stomach and every day needs pocho, pocho, pocho.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:10">0:55:10-0:55:13</a>:</strong>  So you have to keep feeding the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:13">0:55:13-0:55:19</a>:</strong>  And you know, that's with organic mulches and living mulches and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:19">0:55:19-0:55:23</a>:</strong>  So just really trying to break it down to some basic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:23">0:55:23-0:55:27</a>:</strong>  And I'm not saying that this is only for the global south or communities whose you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:27">0:55:27-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  this is for everyone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:29">0:55:29-0:55:31</a>:</strong>  You know, we're not we're not carbon literate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:31">0:55:31-0:55:34</a>:</strong>  We're not soil literate enough.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:39">0:55:39-0:55:45</a>:</strong>  Like I made a video a few last week in South Sudan, which I was so surprised that suddenly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:45">0:55:45-0:55:51</a>:</strong>  had like 10,000 views where I just had the temperature gun and I was in a field that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:55:51">0:55:51-0:55:52</a>:</strong>  was totally desertifying.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:25">0:58:25-0:58:28</a>:</strong>  every time they're using it because a goat will stand on the A-frame.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:32">0:58:32-0:58:35</a>:</strong>  Number one, sun is the thief of water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:35">0:58:35-0:58:37</a>:</strong>  Number two, wind and evaporation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:37">0:58:37-0:58:40</a>:</strong>  And number three, number three, gravity and slope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:40">0:58:40-0:58:41</a>:</strong>  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:41">0:58:41-0:58:42</a>:</strong>  So sun, wind and slope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:42">0:58:42-0:58:46</a>:</strong>  Those are the three ways that your water and soil moisture will leave.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:46">0:58:46-0:58:53</a>:</strong>  But the fourth one is your uncalibrated A-frame.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:53">0:58:53-0:58:58</a>:</strong>  Just like quantum physics, like if your A-frame is a little bit off across a long landscape,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:58:58">0:58:58-0:59:05</a>:</strong>  you're creating a drain and not a contour elevation trench.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:05">0:59:05-0:59:13</a>:</strong>  So we do that and then I was going to say, oh, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:13">0:59:13-0:59:16</a>:</strong>  So when we break into teams and every team gets a name.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:16">0:59:16-0:59:17</a>:</strong>  We try to make it a little competitive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:17">0:59:17-0:59:21</a>:</strong>  I mean, I grew up as an immigrant, you know, only child.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:21">0:59:21-0:59:24</a>:</strong>  So I don't really know how to be competitive, but I try to pretend.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:24">0:59:24-0:59:32</a>:</strong>  So we make A-frames and then I tell every team, go and mark out starting from this point,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:32">0:59:32-0:59:37</a>:</strong>  which do you think is the contour starting from this point?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:37">0:59:37-0:59:42</a>:</strong>  So just with your eyeball, try to measure, you know, figure out where's the natural contour<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:42">0:59:42-0:59:43</a>:</strong>  of this land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:43">0:59:43-0:59:49</a>:</strong>  So every team is going in different directions and then they see, whoa, and then we measure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:49">0:59:49-0:59:52</a>:</strong>  with the A-frame and they're like, oh my God, we're completely off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:52">0:59:52-0:59:58</a>:</strong>  So I try to have little tiny sayings like the eye will lie, the rule is use a tool or,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=0:59:58">0:59:58-1:00:04</a>:</strong>  you know, those kind of little peg mnemonics that can help people remember.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:04">1:00:04-1:00:06</a>:</strong>  People really think they can see contour with their eyes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:06">1:00:06-1:00:07</a>:</strong>  We just can't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:07">1:00:07-1:00:11</a>:</strong>  We're just, our brains are not calibrated that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:11">1:00:11-1:00:17</a>:</strong>  The other thing that we do is like, once we've mapped out the whole long contour, we'll get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:17">1:00:17-1:00:23</a>:</strong>  like 50 or a hundred people to stand and join hands all along that contour.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:23">1:00:23-1:00:28</a>:</strong>  So you really get a visual, a visualization of that same elevation and that contour across<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:28">1:00:28-1:00:34</a>:</strong>  the landscape, which might totally defy what you had imagined.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:41">1:00:41-1:00:42</a>:</strong>  concepts in different ways.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:45">1:00:45-1:00:50</a>:</strong>  And what are some of the things that you have learned that you've picked up maybe in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:50">1:00:50-1:00:54</a>:</strong>  last few years or recently in the activities and the projects that you've done that were<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:00:58">1:00:58-1:01:05</a>:</strong>  Well, the failures, you know, so a lot of, well, that can be answered so many ways, a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:05">1:01:05-1:01:10</a>:</strong>  lot of knowledge around the indigenous and local resources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:10">1:01:10-1:01:17</a>:</strong>  So, you know, we will always do a resource walk where the NGO team is on a team with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:17">1:01:17-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  the community.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:21">1:01:21-1:01:26</a>:</strong>  So every team will go out for like 20 minutes with a bucket or pail and collect all kinds<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/natalie-topa-on-emergency-regeneration-for-communities-in-need/#t=1:01:26">1:01:26-1:01:27</a>:</strong>  of resources.<br />
