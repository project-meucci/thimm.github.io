<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:06:46">0:06:46-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  of my work involves travel and it all just suddenly got really hard.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:47">0:17:47-0:17:53</a>:</strong>  And it might be that animal husbandry, it might be being really great with equipment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:53">0:17:53-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  and just kind of working with where people's where they feel more comfortable and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:02</a>:</strong>  can flourish and we're working within those frameworks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:02">0:18:02-0:18:08</a>:</strong>  And then we have what I call the five M's that we which is our mindset, our management,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:08">0:18:08-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  our minerals, microbes and organic matter form, which is kind of cheating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:18</a>:</strong>  And so using that framework that we lay over what is not working as well as it could in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:18">0:18:18-0:18:21</a>:</strong>  this landscape and which of those is the issue?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:21">0:18:21-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  What is it that's putting a drag on your particular system?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  And we'll we'll run through that using another framework, which is the triage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:33</a>:</strong>  So the triage is where's our decision making process start?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:33">0:18:33-0:18:35</a>:</strong>  If there's a critical point, what's that critical point?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:35">0:18:35-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  So the first place is how well are you capturing sunlight energy?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:42</a>:</strong>  And that might be disrupted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:42">0:18:42-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  If we look at the five M's that might be because of your management.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:51</a>:</strong>  All right, so you haven't been managing for a solar panel to be capturing sunlight energy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:51">0:18:51-0:18:52</a>:</strong>  It might be a mineral deficiency.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:52">0:18:52-0:18:54</a>:</strong>  All right, we haven't got adequate boron.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:54">0:18:54-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  So sugars aren't moving through the plant in terms of photosynthesis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  So we start with sunlight, then we go to air, then we go to water, then we go to decomposition<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  and then we go to minerals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:10</a>:</strong>  So there's a whole process that we look through that five M's through in terms of where's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:10">0:19:10-0:19:15</a>:</strong>  the critical point for someone to be looking at and then bringing that back into what someone's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:15">0:19:15-0:19:17</a>:</strong>  dealing with every single day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:17">0:19:17-0:19:22</a>:</strong>  You know, most people are dealing with weeds and pests and diseases and increasing concerns,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:22">0:19:22-0:19:27</a>:</strong>  obviously, around resilience, either having too much water or not enough water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:27">0:19:27-0:19:33</a>:</strong>  So having these conversations through that and that's where we work through that personal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:33">0:19:33-0:19:35</a>:</strong>  capacity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:35">0:19:35-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  So I wouldn't sit down with someone in their very first conversation and go, tell me about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:41</a>:</strong>  your relationship with money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:41">0:19:41-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  Like it takes trust and rapport and a relationship like you build that ability to expand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:53</a>:</strong>  And there's things that I think as a soundboard or as a coach, people see for themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:53">0:19:53-0:19:56</a>:</strong>  And yeah, that just comes up through conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:19:56">0:19:56-0:19:58</a>:</strong>  Yeah, absolutely.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:02">0:20:02-0:20:07</a>:</strong>  Are there indicators that are some of the first things that you look for that are where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:07">0:20:07-0:20:11</a>:</strong>  things are starting to congeal and stop moving?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:11">0:20:11-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  Or is it really different everywhere that you go?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:22</a>:</strong>  I wish I could say it was really different, but no, we seem to see some very similar patterns<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:22">0:20:22-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  around mismanagement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  And that comes down to the basis of soil structure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:34</a>:</strong>  So seeing soil structure that's falling apart, crusting, compacting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:34">0:20:34-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  And so that all disrupts photosynthesis, that all disrupts air movement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:40</a>:</strong>  So I think I missed out air.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:40">0:20:40-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  So air is your number one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:44</a>:</strong>  How well is that soil aggregated?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:44">0:20:44-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  Is air able to move through?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:49</a>:</strong>  And if not, water is not able to move through either.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:15">1:02:15-1:02:21</a>:</strong>  You know, and if you're looking for a way to let people know what you're up to, a workshop<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:33">1:02:33-1:02:34</a>:</strong>  How do we break it down?<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:41">1:02:41-1:02:46</a>:</strong>  So my goal is not that I'm going to get hired by these people, but that they're going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:46">1:02:46-1:02:50</a>:</strong>  go out and take some new actions and see some results for themselves.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:54">1:02:54-1:02:58</a>:</strong>  of thinking and working through stuff that they might then give me a call and they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:02:58">1:02:58-1:02:59</a>:</strong>  then ready.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:03:05">1:03:05-1:03:09</a>:</strong>  doing that cold turkey like that is really hard.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:10">1:17:10-1:17:16</a>:</strong>  Sometimes I find people are not at the source of this or they're looking for something that<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:21">1:17:21-1:17:26</a>:</strong>  So part of that conversation, you know, and sometimes we say things and it's not necessarily<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/nicole-masters-on-what-it-takes-to-be-an-effective-agricultural-consultant/#t=1:17:26">1:17:26-1:17:27</a>:</strong>  our truth as well.<br />
