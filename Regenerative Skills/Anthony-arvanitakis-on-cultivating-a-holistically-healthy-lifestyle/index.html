<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:04:50">0:04:50-0:04:54</a>:</strong>  I had a motorcycle accident at the point I was finishing my university studies in sports<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:00">0:05:00-0:05:09</a>:</strong>  And it was like an early spring night around 11 p.m., I think, when I was running through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:09">0:05:09-0:05:11</a>:</strong>  this really dark alley.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:25">0:05:25-0:05:28</a>:</strong>  And I started just flying in thin air.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:28">0:05:28-0:05:31</a>:</strong>  I remember it like the whole flight being really cinematic.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:35">0:05:35-0:05:42</a>:</strong>  And yeah, I ended up on the pavement, 21 meters away, as I was informed later on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:42">0:05:42-0:05:46</a>:</strong>  This is like like 80 feet, I think.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:46">0:05:46-0:05:50</a>:</strong>  And I noticed my leg was messed up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:50">0:05:50-0:05:51</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:57">0:05:57-0:05:59</a>:</strong>  And I realized that, OK, that's not a good sign.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:05:59">0:05:59-0:06:02</a>:</strong>  You know, at the moment, there wasn't any pain because you're you know, it's the whole<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:02">0:06:02-0:06:04</a>:</strong>  shock, the adrenaline and all that.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:12">0:06:12-0:06:19</a>:</strong>  I had seven operations where they were trying to save my leg.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:06:49">0:06:49-0:06:53</a>:</strong>  For me, that last surgery was actually the easiest surgery because, you know, I finally<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:29">0:09:29-0:09:34</a>:</strong>  When I had my accident, I was competing in a kind of a kayak in Greece.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  I would say one of the reasons that I didn't get any other injuries from what the doctors<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:09:53">0:09:53-0:10:00</a>:</strong>  But after that, you know, six years not being able to train, you know, most of the times<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:00">0:10:00-0:10:04</a>:</strong>  I would be walking with crutches, motivation was super low.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:25">0:10:25-0:10:30</a>:</strong>  You know, I just I would just hit the streets and run uphill and I get a really good workout<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:36">0:10:36-0:10:42</a>:</strong>  And I didn't have the mental tools to deal with all that difficult situation.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:10:50">0:10:50-0:10:53</a>:</strong>  haven't worked in years.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:17</a>:</strong>  again.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:25</a>:</strong>  that I didn't do prior to my accident.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:25">0:11:25-0:11:33</a>:</strong>  So I would also do things to build my mental toughness to, you know, I started reading<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:33">0:11:33-0:11:40</a>:</strong>  things regarding meditation, self-development, psychology, you know, anything I could read<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:40">0:11:40-0:11:44</a>:</strong>  in combination with nutrition and getting back in shape, you know, anything regarding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:11:45</a>:</strong>  fitness.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:11:57</a>:</strong>  But within six months, I got back in pretty good shape from being like completely skinny<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:11:57">0:11:57-0:11:58</a>:</strong>  fat, as they call it.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:02">0:12:02-0:12:03</a>:</strong>  a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:03">0:12:03-0:12:08</a>:</strong>  I was depressed and I didn't I had lost all of my muscle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:08">0:12:08-0:12:12</a>:</strong>  So I started eating a little bit more, but definitely healthy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:12">0:12:12-0:12:14</a>:</strong>  I started building muscle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:14">0:12:14-0:12:18</a>:</strong>  I started developing myself mentally as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:18">0:12:18-0:12:22</a>:</strong>  And from that point on, things started to go uphill.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:31</a>:</strong>  and better.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  I had no idea about business, online businesses and stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:02</a>:</strong>  So these were things that I had to figure out slowly because I also had to work like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:02">0:16:02-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  12 hours a day at the same time.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:08">0:16:08-0:16:14</a>:</strong>  And that's when I went back to the whiteboard and I started thinking, okay, you know, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:14">0:16:14-0:16:15</a>:</strong>  need to change things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:15">0:16:15-0:16:20</a>:</strong>  I need to, what I did first, it was that I started training early in the morning, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:20">0:16:20-0:16:22</a>:</strong>  I was pretty rigid about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:22">0:16:22-0:16:29</a>:</strong>  I thought that I had to work out for one and a half hour, you know, like the rock does<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:29">0:16:29-0:16:32</a>:</strong>  or people, you know, Hollywood stars do.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:37">0:16:37-0:16:43</a>:</strong>  tired and you've got to wake up like 4 a.m. in the morning to train, you know, that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:43">0:16:43-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  probably not something that is practical for a lot of people and realistic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:49</a>:</strong>  And you know, we do need to sleep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:49">0:16:49-0:16:50</a>:</strong>  Sleep is healthy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:16:50">0:16:50-0:16:54</a>:</strong>  You know, you got these YouTube motivational videos that are like, you know, sleep, I don't<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:04">0:17:04-0:17:11</a>:</strong>  biggest catalysts regarding health and autoimmune diseases and a bunch of other health problems<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:12">0:17:12-0:17:15</a>:</strong>  So definitely don't neglect your sleep.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:15">0:17:15-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  That's important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:21</a>:</strong>  And at some point I realized that I wasn't having fun in the northern Europe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:21">0:17:21-0:17:27</a>:</strong>  You know, I decided to come back in Greece, which was a positive change.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:27">0:17:27-0:17:33</a>:</strong>  But in order to do that, I would have to make my online business, you know, make me a living.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:33">0:17:33-0:17:38</a>:</strong>  So it got to a point that I could make a relatively decent leaving, at least for the place where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:40</a>:</strong>  I live here, where costs are really low.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:40">0:17:40-0:17:43</a>:</strong>  So I came back to Greece, a really big step.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:43">0:17:43-0:17:47</a>:</strong>  I started coaching people also offline other than online.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:47">0:17:47-0:17:52</a>:</strong>  And the problem there began that, you know, although I thought that I'd be I'd have a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:52">0:17:52-0:17:58</a>:</strong>  lot of more time here in Greece, where I live, it's a really small town, really slow paced<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:17:58">0:17:58-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  town.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:06</a>:</strong>  And it got to a point that I was training so many and so much, so many people that I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:06">0:18:06-0:18:10</a>:</strong>  didn't have time to train myself, which is, you know, it's stupid because you're a coach<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:10">0:18:10-0:18:13</a>:</strong>  and you should practice what you preach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:13">0:18:13-0:18:19</a>:</strong>  And that's the moment I realized that, you know, I have to work out in the morning, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:19">0:18:19-0:18:23</a>:</strong>  otherwise I'll just keep postponing my sessions in order to train other people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  But I also have to train more smart, you know, I need to figure out ways to train in a small<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:31</a>:</strong>  amount of time and make it effective.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:31">0:18:31-0:18:37</a>:</strong>  So that's when I developed some more high frequency calisthenic routines that were shorter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:37">0:18:37-0:18:41</a>:</strong>  And turns out, you know, you can get in great shape even with short workouts if you're smart<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:41">0:18:41-0:18:43</a>:</strong>  about the way you train.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:43">0:18:43-0:18:51</a>:</strong>  And I would say that's the point where I started managing life, finding more balance and being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:51">0:18:51-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  a lot more happy, you know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:59</a>:</strong>  And after two years, I would say, it turned out that I was getting more stuff done in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:18:59">0:18:59-0:19:00</a>:</strong>  less time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:00">0:19:00-0:19:03</a>:</strong>  You know, I managed to be more productive by training smarter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:03">0:19:03-0:19:08</a>:</strong>  And the funny thing is that, you know, I took a lot of principles from the way I started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:08">0:19:08-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  my workouts and applied them also to the rest of my life business and everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  And you know, hard work is important, but smart work is also equally important, I would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:20</a>:</strong>  say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:27</a>:</strong>  Now, in terms of getting out of a slump, one of the things that helps me most is training<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:27">0:19:27-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  in the morning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:31</a>:</strong>  Because when you train in the morning, you know, anytime you train during the day, you'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:31">0:19:31-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  feel good, you'll have that post workout feeling of euphoria.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  And everybody knows that, most people at least.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  But what happens when you train early in the morning is that you get to ride that wave<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:46</a>:</strong>  of euphoria during the whole day.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:51">0:19:51-0:19:56</a>:</strong>  your workout before most people are still maybe even in bed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:19:56">0:19:56-0:20:01</a>:</strong>  You know, you have this feeling that you're already like half of your day successful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:01">0:20:01-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  You have this motivation that you know, I got that covered.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:09</a>:</strong>  You have that confidence boost from your workout.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:09">0:20:09-0:20:12</a>:</strong>  And you've got that momentum that carries over during the rest of the day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:12">0:20:12-0:20:19</a>:</strong>  So working out in the morning for me, super helpful for getting out of a slump for getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:19">0:20:19-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  back into a groove and building up your your confidence, your your mood and everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I've definitely found that to be the case for me too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:33</a>:</strong>  And one of the reasons why I got into your workout programs early on, I mean, we talked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:33">0:20:33-0:20:39</a>:</strong>  when I lived back in Guatemala, and I was living more of a traveling lifestyle, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:39">0:20:39-0:20:45</a>:</strong>  inconsistencies and the variables of that lifestyle was often the the blame that I put<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:45">0:20:45-0:20:50</a>:</strong>  on not being able to get into a regular routine and hold on to it for any period of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:50">0:20:50-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  But I think one of the ways that your specific programs have taken away points of friction<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:21:00</a>:</strong>  are because you don't need equipment and you don't need to go to a gym to be able to do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:00">0:21:00-0:21:03</a>:</strong>  this, which was for me extremely helpful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:03">0:21:03-0:21:07</a>:</strong>  Not needing to have all of these things with you or having to go to another place helped<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:07">0:21:07-0:21:12</a>:</strong>  to remove a point of friction that would otherwise have kept me from getting these routines started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:12">0:21:12-0:21:18</a>:</strong>  And also some of the clear start and finish dates of a few of the programs that you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:18">0:21:18-0:21:22</a>:</strong>  helped me to see it as, OK, this isn't a permanent forever thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:22">0:21:22-0:21:25</a>:</strong>  You know, I can just get through these couple of months.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:25">0:21:25-0:21:27</a>:</strong>  I can put some goals on there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:27">0:21:27-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  And if there are big changes in my life or things aren't conducive to keeping it going,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:34</a>:</strong>  I can also stop it or take a break to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:34">0:21:34-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  And being able to see that ahead gave me the confidence that I wasn't getting into more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:41</a>:</strong>  that I could commit to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:41">0:21:41-0:21:43</a>:</strong>  So those things were helpful as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:43">0:21:43-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  And now you are known mostly for the workout programs that you promote and the physiology<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:53</a>:</strong>  and and body weight training, of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:21:53">0:21:53-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  But I'm interested in your definition of holistic health and the other key disciplines or routines<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:05</a>:</strong>  that have helped you to feel better in lots of different aspects of your life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:05">0:22:05-0:22:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so the things that have helped me holistically, I would say one thing is meditation, mindfulness,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:15">0:22:15-0:22:22</a>:</strong>  which it's not something that I always do, but I definitely reintroduce it during periods<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:22">0:22:22-0:22:24</a>:</strong>  that I need it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:24">0:22:24-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  One thing that I find that works really well is placing meditation after a workout, because,<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:35">0:22:35-0:22:36</a>:</strong>  decompressed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:36">0:22:36-0:22:43</a>:</strong>  You know, your your energy is more stable and your head is clearer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:43">0:22:43-0:22:48</a>:</strong>  So it's sort of like a shortcut to getting faster, to a more mindful state.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:48">0:22:48-0:22:53</a>:</strong>  So combining meditation after a morning workout for me works miraculously.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:22:53">0:22:53-0:23:00</a>:</strong>  I would say like five minutes are enough after a workout when in order to reach that same,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:00">0:23:00-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  you know, spot of being mindful, calm and for depending on what type of meditation you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:09</a>:</strong>  doing that can vary in terms of, you know, what is the stage you want to reach?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:09">0:23:09-0:23:16</a>:</strong>  But for me, just clearing my head and getting at a point where I'm peaceful, I have inner<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:16">0:23:16-0:23:21</a>:</strong>  peace usually would take about 15 to 20 minutes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:21">0:23:21-0:23:25</a>:</strong>  But if I do it after a workout, it takes like three to five minutes, especially a morning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:25">0:23:25-0:23:28</a>:</strong>  workout when your head is already pretty clear.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:24:01</a>:</strong>  The last two years I started playing the piano, which has been a really fun experience and<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:17">0:24:17-0:24:20</a>:</strong>  me a positive boost, a mental boost.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:24">0:24:24-0:24:28</a>:</strong>  Your workouts won't be always going well.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:33">0:24:33-0:24:39</a>:</strong>  So for me, that's business, that's exercise, you know, I like seeing progress in terms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:39">0:24:39-0:24:41</a>:</strong>  of working out and all that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:41">0:24:41-0:24:46</a>:</strong>  And my hobby, which is playing music, you know, even if two areas are doing really bad,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:46">0:24:46-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  like my business, let's say, working out, maybe I have an injury or whatever, even if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  I have like a little bit of progress with my music practice, for some reason that makes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:25:00</a>:</strong>  me happy, and it keeps me motivated to keep on going.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:04">0:25:04-0:25:11</a>:</strong>  you can do every day, that just gets you out of the rest of your life, you know, that out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:11">0:25:11-0:25:14</a>:</strong>  of the other things that might be stressful.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:19">0:25:19-0:25:26</a>:</strong>  the way we're wired, you know, our brain detaches from stuff by doing manual work or work that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:26">0:25:26-0:25:31</a>:</strong>  requires your limbs and some amount of dexterity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:31">0:25:31-0:25:37</a>:</strong>  So playing music for me is also in a way a form of meditation as well, you know, for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:37">0:25:37-0:25:41</a>:</strong>  20 minutes every day, that's the minimum amount I have, because I know that's realistic and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:41">0:25:41-0:25:42</a>:</strong>  practical.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:42">0:25:42-0:25:47</a>:</strong>  And, you know, sometimes I'll have more time to for my hobby, but sometimes I'll have even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:47">0:25:47-0:25:48</a>:</strong>  less.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:25:55</a>:</strong>  So I make sure that I get at least like 15 to 20 minutes minimum of practice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:25:55">0:25:55-0:26:00</a>:</strong>  And that that has helped me a lot because, you know, up to two to three years ago, my<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:00">0:26:00-0:26:04</a>:</strong>  only daily focus would be like work and exercise.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:04">0:26:04-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  And exercise is also in a way part of my work of my job.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  So sometimes it's difficult to detach one from the other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:18</a>:</strong>  So having a hobby, you know, something you do for yourself, I think really important,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:18">0:26:18-0:26:23</a>:</strong>  you know, you shouldn't be just trying, focusing on work and, you know, taking care of other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:23">0:26:23-0:26:27</a>:</strong>  people, your family, you know, as much as you love them, you should have something that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:27">0:26:27-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  you do that is more personal, a personal hobby.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:34</a>:</strong>  I find that to be essential for mental health as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:34">0:26:34-0:26:37</a>:</strong>  That's really interesting that you mentioned that right now, because that's one of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:37">0:26:37-0:26:42</a>:</strong>  things that I in just the last week have identified that is missing from my life at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:42">0:26:42-0:26:46</a>:</strong>  And one of the reasons why I actually find myself in a little bit of a slump, even though<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:46">0:26:46-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  I just finished the superhero workout program, it's often when you complete something large<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:26:55</a>:</strong>  and haven't planned the next thing yet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:26:55">0:26:55-0:27:02</a>:</strong>  It's easy to drop off and not keep the momentum that you had from before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:02">0:27:02-0:27:06</a>:</strong>  And you also mentioned, you know, the meditation, which fits into something that you've promoted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:06">0:27:06-0:27:09</a>:</strong>  for a long time, the mind to muscle connection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:09">0:27:09-0:27:14</a>:</strong>  And well, first of all, could you explain that slightly and talk about perhaps other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:14">0:27:14-0:27:20</a>:</strong>  key understandings of physiology that were breakthrough discoveries for you as you learned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:20">0:27:20-0:27:24</a>:</strong>  to optimize your health?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:24">0:27:24-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  So I would say the first year that I trained, you know, I was focused strictly on numbers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:34</a>:</strong>  you know, getting my ribs up and all that and sets and training volume.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:34">0:27:34-0:27:41</a>:</strong>  But I came to a point that I was pretty stuck in terms of progress.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:41">0:27:41-0:27:45</a>:</strong>  You know, I wasn't seeing any progress in the mirror, building more muscle and stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:45">0:27:45-0:27:46</a>:</strong>  like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:46">0:27:46-0:27:52</a>:</strong>  So I was like, OK, I can either start doing weighted calisthenics, which is, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:52">0:27:52-0:27:58</a>:</strong>  in a way, also a little bit that carries over more to weight training than it is calisthenics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:27:58">0:27:58-0:28:00</a>:</strong>  Not that I'm against it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:00">0:28:00-0:28:04</a>:</strong>  You know, I do have a place for weighted calisthenics in my programing as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:04">0:28:04-0:28:09</a>:</strong>  But for me, it's essential that you can have a routine that doesn't require anything more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:09">0:28:09-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  than I would say pull a bar or set of rings.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:18</a>:</strong>  So I was I started looking for more ways to make my workouts challenging.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:18">0:28:18-0:28:25</a>:</strong>  And I started noticing that one thing that was missing, not only from my workout, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:25">0:28:25-0:28:29</a>:</strong>  especially from a lot of other people's workouts was that mind to muscle connection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:29">0:28:29-0:28:35</a>:</strong>  So basically feeling your body work while you're training, you know, feeling the muscles<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:35">0:28:35-0:28:41</a>:</strong>  that are the protagonist muscles, getting that muscle tension, you know, feeling that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:41">0:28:41-0:28:43</a>:</strong>  muscle contraction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:43">0:28:43-0:28:48</a>:</strong>  How much of a difference, first of all, that can make for people who are detached from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:48">0:28:48-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  their bodies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:54</a>:</strong>  I find that most people who haven't had an athletic background growing up are really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:54">0:28:54-0:28:55</a>:</strong>  bad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:28:55">0:28:55-0:29:00</a>:</strong>  You know, in quotes at mind to muscle connection, they just go through the motion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:00">0:29:00-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  They don't connect with their bodies at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:06</a>:</strong>  And that's one of the reasons they are lacking progress.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:06">0:29:06-0:29:11</a>:</strong>  You know, I had a lot of people that were training, doing getting like a lot of reps,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:11">0:29:11-0:29:16</a>:</strong>  but weren't seeing any difference in building muscle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:16">0:29:16-0:29:18</a>:</strong>  And I was pretty skeptical about it until one day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:18">0:29:18-0:29:21</a>:</strong>  I remember I was training at this calisthenics park.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:21">0:29:21-0:29:24</a>:</strong>  And there was a guy who was doing like push ups.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:24">0:29:24-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  He was doing like 60 or 70 push ups and bam, bam, bam, like really fast, really limited<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  range of motion.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:50">0:29:50-0:29:52</a>:</strong>  my chest and all of that.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:29:57">0:29:57-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  get him another rep, but I had a pretty decent body in terms of muscle growth and all that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:05</a>:</strong>  And he was like, how come am I skinny?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:05">0:30:05-0:30:08</a>:</strong>  You know, he will, my Dutch wear wasn't that good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:08">0:30:08-0:30:12</a>:</strong>  At that point, so we're communicating in like in bad mean, bad Dutch.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:12">0:30:12-0:30:17</a>:</strong>  And he was trying to talk to me in simple Dutch so I could figure out what he was saying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:17">0:30:17-0:30:18</a>:</strong>  He couldn't speak English.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:25">0:30:25-0:30:28</a>:</strong>  have all this muscle growth?<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:38">0:30:38-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  slow using clean form and really connecting to your body, you know, feeling that muscle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:51</a>:</strong>  activation using my two muscle cues that help you make each rep more difficult, you know,<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:30:56</a>:</strong>  try to do.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:30:58">0:30:58-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  But I think that his ego was a little bit bigger and he didn't want to accept it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:08</a>:</strong>  And he just went back to training the way he was training.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:08">0:31:08-0:31:13</a>:</strong>  So that was like a light bulb moment for me that I realized that, OK, people are getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:13">0:31:13-0:31:20</a>:</strong>  reps and stuff, but they're not really focusing on that mind to muscle connection, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:20">0:31:20-0:31:25</a>:</strong>  essential, because your body doesn't really understand reps, especially if they're really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:25">0:31:25-0:31:26</a>:</strong>  bad in terms of form.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:26">0:31:26-0:31:30</a>:</strong>  What your body, first of all, understands is muscle tension.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:30">0:31:30-0:31:37</a>:</strong>  You know, that's how your muscles get stimulated in order to trigger hypertrophy and stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:37">0:31:37-0:31:38</a>:</strong>  like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:38">0:31:38-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  So there was an aha moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:44</a>:</strong>  And that's when I started working on my two muscle cues.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:44">0:31:44-0:31:49</a>:</strong>  I started implementing them, first of all, in my practice and I started seeing progress<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:49">0:31:49-0:31:50</a>:</strong>  again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:50">0:31:50-0:31:53</a>:</strong>  You know, I was pretty stuck for a while and suddenly I was building more muscle without<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:53">0:31:53-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  by actually doing less reps than I was doing previously.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:02</a>:</strong>  And the great thing was that a lot of people were getting great results.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:07</a>:</strong>  And I remember like a specific email, somebody sent me an email, I already remember this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:07">0:32:07-0:32:10</a>:</strong>  and told me that, you know, I've been doing push ups for 10 years and it's the first time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:10">0:32:10-0:32:13</a>:</strong>  that my chest is sore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:13">0:32:13-0:32:17</a>:</strong>  So that was like a great moment in my training journey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:17">0:32:17-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  And that's when I got really interested in my muscle connection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:20">0:32:20-0:32:22</a>:</strong>  Back then, there wasn't a lot of research.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:22">0:32:22-0:32:26</a>:</strong>  It was the point where research was emerging on my muscle connection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:26">0:32:26-0:32:32</a>:</strong>  You know, of course, you had like the old bodybuilding camp that believes a lot of muscle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:32">0:32:32-0:32:36</a>:</strong>  mass, my muscle connection in the scientific community of fitness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:36">0:32:36-0:32:40</a>:</strong>  Some people were supporting it, some not.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:40">0:32:40-0:32:46</a>:</strong>  But it's it's began to grow a lot and we have more and more research showing how important<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:46">0:32:46-0:32:47</a>:</strong>  it is actually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:47">0:32:47-0:32:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it makes sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:48">0:32:48-0:32:53</a>:</strong>  And it was a real click for me to and I mean, it makes a lot of sense, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:53">0:32:53-0:32:58</a>:</strong>  You're focusing on quality over quantity, which has a lot of returns in so many aspects<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:32:58">0:32:58-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  of life, including fitness.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:05">0:33:05-0:33:09</a>:</strong>  training and workouts are great for overall strength, endurance, conditioning and things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:09">0:33:09-0:33:10</a>:</strong>  like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:10">0:33:10-0:33:14</a>:</strong>  But a lot of people expect different results, not realizing that there's an 80 20 principle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:14">0:33:14-0:33:17</a>:</strong>  that often comes along with diet and nutrition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:17">0:33:17-0:33:21</a>:</strong>  If you're really looking for body composition and certainly something like aesthetics or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:26</a>:</strong>  like many people are motivated to either lose or to gain weight, that really that comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:26">0:33:26-0:33:30</a>:</strong>  into play with how you're eating a lot more than how you're working out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:30">0:33:30-0:33:35</a>:</strong>  You talk about that and how you have worked your own nutrition and diet into the plan<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:35">0:33:35-0:33:37</a>:</strong>  of your overall health.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:37">0:33:37-0:33:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah, because I mean, a lot of people might be in great shape and have like really strong<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:43">0:33:43-0:33:46</a>:</strong>  abdominals and a lot of muscle mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:46">0:33:46-0:33:51</a>:</strong>  But you know, if that muscle mass and your abs are covered by a lot of adipose tissue,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:51">0:33:51-0:33:56</a>:</strong>  you know, fat, basically, they're not going to show in the mirror.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:33:56">0:33:56-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  And you know, of course, training is not just about looking good in the mirror, but it is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:04</a>:</strong>  a part for everybody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:04">0:34:04-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  You know, we definitely like looking at progress in the mirror.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:12</a>:</strong>  And that helps with motivation as well, especially in the beginning, until you gain some momentum.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:12">0:34:12-0:34:17</a>:</strong>  And that is the reason that I recommend to people that, you know, you always start your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:17">0:34:17-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  workout routine with a nutritional plan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:27</a>:</strong>  And if you have a lot of body fat, especially if you're above 20%, definitely work on creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:27">0:34:27-0:34:34</a>:</strong>  a caloric deficit so you can start losing some fat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:34">0:34:34-0:34:37</a>:</strong>  And as you get stronger, especially in the beginning, when you're a beginner, it's pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:37">0:34:37-0:34:43</a>:</strong>  easy to build muscle and lose fat at the same time.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:51">0:34:51-0:34:56</a>:</strong>  physiology advanced that you have, the advantage that you have in order to build muscle while<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:34:56">0:34:56-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  losing fat.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:05">0:35:05-0:35:10</a>:</strong>  no difference in the mirror, because you're just, it's just covered by fat, pretty fast<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:10">0:35:10-0:35:12</a>:</strong>  for most people that can be demotivating.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:16">0:35:16-0:35:23</a>:</strong>  mirror as well, you start losing fat, usually that is a lot more helpful in creating a sustainable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:23">0:35:23-0:35:24</a>:</strong>  workout routine.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:35:58">0:35:58-0:36:04</a>:</strong>  fasting diets, I've tried paleo diets, I've tried food combining diets, I've tried, I<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:25">0:36:25-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  And I like to see what are these people doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:34</a>:</strong>  Now the thing is that in different blue zones, there's not like a standard way of eating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:34">0:36:34-0:36:38</a>:</strong>  that seems to work, you know, it's not that all the centurions are mainly vegetarian,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:38">0:36:38-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  or are mainly doing paleo, or are doing this type of workout routine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:49</a>:</strong>  As a matter of fact, you know, in all of the blue zones, not all of them, but in most of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:49">0:36:49-0:36:53</a>:</strong>  the blue zones, there are no gyms, which is interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:53">0:36:53-0:36:59</a>:</strong>  And although, you know, people are in great shape, at least in terms of health, and leave<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:36:59">0:36:59-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  the longest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:07</a>:</strong>  So what we do know from these people is that first of all, their life requires a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:07">0:37:07-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  manual labor on a daily basis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  And even as they get old, because, you know, what happens in a lot of these places is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:19</a>:</strong>  you don't have running water, you know, you have to walk all the way to the well and get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:19">0:37:19-0:37:21</a>:</strong>  it by yourself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:21">0:37:21-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  In order to have food, you know, you have to take care of your own produce.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:26">0:37:26-0:37:33</a>:</strong>  So in one way or another, these places usually have a lifestyle that requires a lot of manual<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:33">0:37:33-0:37:34</a>:</strong>  labor.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:34">0:37:34-0:37:39</a>:</strong>  And people that eat less than they burn, like that's basically it, you know, people that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:39">0:37:39-0:37:47</a>:</strong>  eat less food, and in combination with manual labor, stay lean, as lean as possible until<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:47">0:37:47-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  they're as old, you know, as they can get.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:52</a>:</strong>  So that's definitely the key.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:52">0:37:52-0:37:58</a>:</strong>  One thing is, you know, staying lean, definitely a key for staying healthy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:37:58">0:37:58-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  And we know from studying all the blue zones, you can do that with most diets, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  you can do that with a vegetarian diet, you can do that with a pilot diet, it doesn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:13</a>:</strong>  really matter as long as you are eating healthy and you have that caloric deficit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:13">0:38:13-0:38:20</a>:</strong>  So my approach nowadays is that I eat a little bit of everything, you know, I try to keep<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:20">0:38:20-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  my protein high, because that keeps me satiated.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:27</a>:</strong>  And that also serves my muscle building goals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:27">0:38:27-0:38:31</a>:</strong>  I don't track everything on a daily basis, you know, I think that is important for you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:31">0:38:31-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  know, when I when I train people, for example, I will always get them started with tracking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:39</a>:</strong>  everything for at least a week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:39">0:38:39-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  So that way they can develop a nutritional consciousness, you know, they know that when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  they're eating like a slice of bread with peanut butter, that's not 200 calories, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  know, that might be even 600 calories, if your idea of what a spoon of peanut butter<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:39:03</a>:</strong>  is, is triple, then you know what the the real peanut butter spoon is, you know, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:03">0:39:03-0:39:07</a>:</strong>  some people will fill it up completely, and that can be 300 calories, and some people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:07">0:39:07-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  will just take a little like a really flat spoon, which is 80 calories or 90 calories.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:16">0:39:16-0:39:22</a>:</strong>  So sorry, so most people, for most people, what I do is I make them track everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:22">0:39:22-0:39:28</a>:</strong>  for at least a week, that way they create caloric consciousness, you know, they know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:28">0:39:28-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  what they're eating on a daily basis, they know more or less how many calories they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:36</a>:</strong>  getting in. Most times people are pretty surprised by the amount of calories they get with a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:36">0:39:36-0:39:41</a>:</strong>  lot of foods that are, you know, caloric bombs, as I call them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:41">0:39:41-0:39:48</a>:</strong>  And this helps a lot in afterwards, just, you know, having enough knowledge to basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:48">0:39:48-0:39:54</a>:</strong>  eyeball your portions and know that, you know, like this amount of food is 400 calories,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:39:54">0:39:54-0:40:00</a>:</strong>  it's not like 100 calories, as I might, as people might have thought previously. So I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:00">0:40:00-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  always start with that, you know, track everything for at least a week. So you understand, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:09</a>:</strong>  know, what is the amount of calories you're getting in more or less on a daily basis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:09">0:40:09-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  What I what I realized with this is that most people that are pretty thin and struggle to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:21</a>:</strong>  gain weight are underestimating, sorry, are overestimating their caloric intake, and people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:21">0:40:21-0:40:27</a>:</strong>  who are struggling to lose weight are usually underestimating it. And we've seen that in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:27">0:40:27-0:40:32</a>:</strong>  research, even with people that are, you know, trained professional nutritionists, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:32">0:40:32-0:40:39</a>:</strong>  even these people can miscalculate their, their caloric intake if they're not tracking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:39">0:40:39-0:40:45</a>:</strong>  everything in detail. So, you know, definitely get started with that. Definitely focus on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:45">0:40:45-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  keeping your protein high. That's because protein is one of the macronutrients that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  gives you the most satiation while also being the most metabolic active, metabolically active<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:03</a>:</strong>  macronutrients. So an easy way to explain this is that if you eat 100 calories of protein,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:03">0:41:03-0:41:09</a>:</strong>  your body is going to need three, sorry, 30 calories to burn that, to metabolize that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:09">0:41:09-0:41:17</a>:</strong>  So no protein has 30%, requires 30% of your energy to break down that food, whereas carbs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:17">0:41:17-0:41:23</a>:</strong>  need only 10, need 10%. So if you eat 100 calories of carbs, you're only going to spend<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:23">0:41:23-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  10 calories to burn your carbs. So keeping protein high for me is important, especially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  if you're athletic, if you're training. A pretty common bias is that people think they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:39</a>:</strong>  need less protein as they grow older, when the reality is that we know from recent analysis<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:39">0:41:39-0:41:45</a>:</strong>  that you need more. Each year after 30, you need to slightly increase your caloric intake.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:45">0:41:45-0:41:53</a>:</strong>  But of course you also have to decrease your calories a bit, but in terms of how much protein<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:53">0:41:53-0:41:59</a>:</strong>  you need, you need to slowly increase that as you age. That's another important thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:41:59">0:41:59-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  And other than that, just focus on minimally processed foods, go as organically as you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:15</a>:</strong>  can, biological foods, foods that are real. If it's in a plastic wrap and it's a, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:15">0:42:15-0:42:20</a>:</strong>  square shaped or perfectly round shaped, you know, usually it's not real food. If it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:20">0:42:20-0:42:26</a>:</strong>  something that you can pick from the floor or from a tree or something you can kill,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:26">0:42:26-0:42:33</a>:</strong>  sorry, vegans, by the way, then it is, you know, it's real food. So focus on real food,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:33">0:42:33-0:42:38</a>:</strong>  focus on having a caloric deficit. If you want to lose weight or being at calorie maintenance,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:38">0:42:38-0:42:44</a>:</strong>  you know, if you want to be steady or if you want to gain weight, do it slowly and always<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:44">0:42:44-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  do it in a combination with a strength training workout routine so you gain quality mass.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:51">0:42:51-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  I mean, I can talk for hours about nutrition, but maybe you should shoot some more questions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:42:57</a>:</strong>  if you want me to be a bit more specific.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:42:57">0:42:57-0:43:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I know there's some really great stuff in there. I like how you mentioned the blue<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:01">0:43:01-0:43:06</a>:</strong>  zones as reference and that there is a lot of variation within the different areas around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:06">0:43:06-0:43:11</a>:</strong>  the world, but there are also some recurring patterns that we can gather from, right? That<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:11">0:43:11-0:43:16</a>:</strong>  this is much more of a traditional lifestyle where people are active throughout their entire<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:16">0:43:16-0:43:21</a>:</strong>  life. And maybe it's not really intense bursts of like workouts, but they're always moving<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:21">0:43:21-0:43:26</a>:</strong>  around and there's always some sort of resistance, right? They're not just sitting on a couch<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:26">0:43:26-0:43:32</a>:</strong>  and then doing sprints or doing massive workouts. That's very uncommon in human history and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:32">0:43:32-0:43:38</a>:</strong>  nature and the same with those takeaways from diet. Like it's mostly locally produced, fresh<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:38">0:43:38-0:43:44</a>:</strong>  food. Maybe it's vegetarian, maybe it includes some meat and the plants are very different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:44">0:43:44-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  at different parts of the world, but there are commonalities that we can start to suss<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:43:52</a>:</strong>  out. And this has also been part of what we talked about before about getting back into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:52">0:43:52-0:43:57</a>:</strong>  routines and seeing this as a longer term commitment to a lifestyle rather than just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:43:57">0:43:57-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  a habit that you pick up or you give up for a while and the risk of going in these yo-yo<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:09">0:44:09-0:44:15</a>:</strong>  in your own mind as this is much more of a lifestyle for you. It's taken a huge transformation<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:26">0:44:26-0:44:32</a>:</strong>  the mindset of seeing this in the long term and what helps you to reduce or avoid entirely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:32">0:44:32-0:44:39</a>:</strong>  these ebbs and flows that can disrupt regular progress?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:39">0:44:39-0:44:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah. So one of my favorite books on habit formation is by BJ Fogg. It's called Tiny<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:44">0:44:44-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  Habits and in the beginning of the book he says that in order to change, in order to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:44:54</a>:</strong>  create a sustainable habit, this habit has to first of all make you feel good. Once you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:44:54">0:44:54-0:45:01</a>:</strong>  done with the habit, it should have some positive effects on you. So one of the key, that was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:01">0:45:01-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  a really big light bulb moment for me when I read that book. As simple as it sounds,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:12</a>:</strong>  your workouts shouldn't just be about improving your body, looking better in front of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:12">0:45:12-0:45:16</a>:</strong>  mirror. First of all, the first thing, the first essential thing should be that your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:16">0:45:16-0:45:22</a>:</strong>  workouts make you feel good. They amplify your life. They're not something on your to-do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:30</a>:</strong>  list that you have to do that feels so mandatory and so like homework, as I like to say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:30">0:45:30-0:45:36</a>:</strong>  And that was like a big moment for me. I realized that my workouts should first of all make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:36">0:45:36-0:45:42</a>:</strong>  me feel good. And that's what I focus on nowadays. I do them early in the morning because that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:42">0:45:42-0:45:47</a>:</strong>  the time of the day that I enjoy them the most and they're short and they're dynamic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:47">0:45:47-0:45:54</a>:</strong>  And once I'm done, I have like a cold shower and I feel really good. I know that I'll be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:54">0:45:54-0:45:59</a>:</strong>  a lot more energetic during the rest of the day. I know that I'll be, my head will be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:45:59">0:45:59-0:46:05</a>:</strong>  a lot more focused. I'll be more calm. You know, when I don't train, especially for if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:05">0:46:05-0:46:10</a>:</strong>  I do that for more than three days, I notice it, you know, my mood drops a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:10">0:46:10-0:46:17</a>:</strong>  I'm more aggressive. I would say, you know, I snap more easily and yeah, it definitely<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:17">0:46:17-0:46:25</a>:</strong>  affects me mentally. So for me, like a short morning workout is the best dose of exercise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:25">0:46:25-0:46:32</a>:</strong>  and the way I enjoy training the most. I like doing it on a daily basis or three minimum<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:32">0:46:32-0:46:38</a>:</strong>  five days a week, five to six days a week, but I'll keep it short. And you know, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:38">0:46:38-0:46:43</a>:</strong>  way I get the most of it. I enjoy it. I'm not completely drained after the workout.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:43">0:46:43-0:46:51</a>:</strong>  You know, it's not that I'm dragging my feet and I'm tired. On the contrary, I'm more energized.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:51">0:46:51-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  And you know, when I see the effect that my workout has that way and the rest of my day,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:46:55">0:46:55-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  how it makes me a better person, it makes me a better coach, a better businessman, a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:08</a>:</strong>  better boyfriend to my girlfriend, you know, and all these things. That's when exercise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:08">0:47:08-0:47:16</a>:</strong>  for me is really sustainable, you know, whereas if I had to do like two hours and, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:16">0:47:16-0:47:20</a>:</strong>  I would get bored at the end of the workout and I'd be trained for the rest of the day<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:20">0:47:20-0:47:24</a>:</strong>  and it would be like strictly to accomplish this amount of goal, you know, gaining that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:24">0:47:24-0:47:29</a>:</strong>  amount of muscle, it wouldn't be something sustainable anymore for me, for sure. So first<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:29">0:47:29-0:47:36</a>:</strong>  of all, I focus when I coach people, for example, we sit and we talk and we say, okay, like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:36">0:47:36-0:47:41</a>:</strong>  what is the best frequency for you? You know, what is the best amount of training that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:41">0:47:41-0:47:47</a>:</strong>  enjoy? How can we create a workout routine that leaves you happy? You know, that leaves<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:47">0:47:47-0:47:53</a>:</strong>  you that you do every day without feeling pressured and you enjoy and all of these things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:53">0:47:53-0:47:59</a>:</strong>  So, you know, training frequency and training dosage is highly important. You know, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:47:59">0:47:59-0:48:03</a>:</strong>  have to figure out what works best for you. Some people like training three times a week<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:03">0:48:03-0:48:08</a>:</strong>  and having something more dynamic. Other people training, prefer training on a daily basis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:08">0:48:08-0:48:12</a>:</strong>  You know, they find that working out that way is more sustainable. And I think that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:12">0:48:12-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  for most people, that is true. You know, having like a daily routine, something you do almost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:23</a>:</strong>  every day is more easy and more sustainable because it sort of becomes automatic, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:23">0:48:23-0:48:27</a>:</strong>  know, like brushing your teeth. You know, that's not something that you do some days<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:27">0:48:27-0:48:32</a>:</strong>  and won't do some days. You know, it's something that is standard, you know, every day in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:32">0:48:32-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  morning I'll brush my teeth. So training, using a high frequency workout routine works<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:43</a>:</strong>  in the same way. And yeah, first of all, it should amplify your life. You know, it should<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:43">0:48:43-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  give more value, it should improve all of the rest of the areas of your life that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:48:54</a>:</strong>  important. And when your workout does that for you is when your workout will be something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:54">0:48:54-0:48:56</a>:</strong>  more easily sustainable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:48:56">0:48:56-0:49:02</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and it seems like people come to this type of discipline from a lot of different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:02">0:49:02-0:49:07</a>:</strong>  aspects with different goals and different desired outcomes, right? And it maybe isn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:07">0:49:07-0:49:12</a>:</strong>  always a workout routine that they end up with. Maybe like you mentioned before, meditation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:12">0:49:12-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  or something more like yoga or stretching, and it could be an entirely different discipline,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:24</a>:</strong>  but it can often be the anchoring point. Like you said, that gives way to a lot of these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:24">0:49:24-0:49:32</a>:</strong>  other emergent benefits as you start to cultivate a practice of self care of whatever way, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:32">0:49:32-0:49:36</a>:</strong>  Whichever way you're trying to improve in and wherever you're trying to get. But having<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:36">0:49:36-0:49:42</a>:</strong>  something that offers some routine, some consistency, but also a little bit of a challenge. And<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  pushes you to continue to improve often has these run on effects for other aspects of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:53</a>:</strong>  your life. And in talking about that, what advice would you give to people who are looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:53">0:49:53-0:49:59</a>:</strong>  to start to cultivate holistic health in their lives? So what are some of the entry points<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:49:59">0:49:59-0:50:04</a>:</strong>  and what are some of the things that beyond just workouts have really made a difference<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:04">0:50:04-0:50:09</a>:</strong>  in your feeling of well being and your interactions with the world outside as well?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:09">0:50:09-0:50:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah. So first of all, when it comes to exercise, you know, when people ask me, what is the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:15">0:50:15-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  best body weight exercise? My typical answer is walking, which is not like that doesn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:21">0:50:21-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  sound that sexy and amazing. But yeah, if you don't walk, even if you train, like you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:31</a>:</strong>  have a really dynamic workout in the morning and you do nothing the rest of the day, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:31">0:50:31-0:50:35</a>:</strong>  just sit in an office, that's not going to be really effective. You know, that's going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:35">0:50:35-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  to be you'll still be unhealthy in the long run. And I've noticed this, you know, with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:40">0:50:40-0:50:45</a>:</strong>  the current quarantine and all that, I would get my workout in the morning. And this year,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:45">0:50:45-0:50:49</a>:</strong>  I focused a lot on my online business. So I would sit a lot the rest during the rest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:49">0:50:49-0:50:55</a>:</strong>  of the day. And I realized that, you know, my metabolism is a little bit slower, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:50:55">0:50:55-0:51:02</a>:</strong>  I'm getting more blurry in the abdominal area and my mood is not that good. And I realized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:02">0:51:02-0:51:06</a>:</strong>  that, you know, it's not just about training, you should move. And that's when I got like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:06">0:51:06-0:51:16</a>:</strong>  a smartwatch. And I had a goal of walking at least 12,000 steps a day. And that's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:16">0:51:16-0:51:21</a>:</strong>  including my workout. So when I work out, I actually take off my fit smartwatch. And<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:21">0:51:21-0:51:24</a>:</strong>  I leave it on the side because, you know, I don't want to count my steps, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:24">0:51:24-0:51:29</a>:</strong>  I want to have my step goals separate from my workout goal. Because I know even if I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:29">0:51:29-0:51:35</a>:</strong>  work out, if I don't walk, if I don't move, I'm not going to be healthy. So you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:35">0:51:35-0:51:40</a>:</strong>  we are creatures that have to move, you know, you can sit all day in an office and expect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:40">0:51:40-0:51:48</a>:</strong>  to be healthy, both physically and mentally. So for me, walking is just essential, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:48">0:51:48-0:51:53</a>:</strong>  know, for anybody that wants to lose weight to be healthy. There's no way that you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:53">0:51:53-0:51:59</a>:</strong>  going to sit all day, even if you have a daily workout. If you don't move around, things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:51:59">0:51:59-0:52:07</a>:</strong>  are you're not going to be ultimately healthy. And I see that effect not only on the body,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:07">0:52:07-0:52:13</a>:</strong>  as I said, but also mentally, you know, when I stick to my 12,000 steps a day, my mood<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:13">0:52:13-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  is always a lot more stable, a lot more better. So definitely find a way to move on a daily<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:25</a>:</strong>  basis. You know, you don't have to do calisthenics like I do. I mean, I love calisthenics. It's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:25">0:52:25-0:52:31</a>:</strong>  my way of living my, the most essential part of my fitness routine. But that doesn't mean<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:31">0:52:31-0:52:36</a>:</strong>  that it has to be for you as well. You know, even if you just walk and you watch your diet,<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:50</a>:</strong>  find a form of movement that you enjoy and you find sustainable. So that would be tip<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:50">0:52:50-0:52:58</a>:</strong>  number one. I'm not a big fan of activities that have you sit at. So for example, I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:52:58">0:52:58-0:53:02</a>:</strong>  not a big fan of cycling. And I have a lot of friends that are professional cyclists<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:02">0:53:02-0:53:07</a>:</strong>  and stuff like that, and who get a little bit aggravated aggravated when I say that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:07">0:53:07-0:53:12</a>:</strong>  But you know, when you spent the whole day sitting, and your exercise is also done in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:12">0:53:12-0:53:17</a>:</strong>  a seated position, you know, I think that's not good. And I can see that in people who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:17">0:53:17-0:53:22</a>:</strong>  do a lot of cycling with their lower back problems with their shoulder problems. So<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:22">0:53:22-0:53:27</a>:</strong>  I definitely find a form of movement that has you moving in a more upright position,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:27">0:53:27-0:53:31</a>:</strong>  you know, that gets you out of that seated position, especially if you sit a lot during<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:39">0:53:39-0:53:45</a>:</strong>  tip number one in terms of nutrition. Again, you know, find something that a diet that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:45">0:53:45-0:53:52</a>:</strong>  is as minimally processed as possible, find a way of eating that energizes you, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:52">0:53:52-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  I find that some people do really well with vegetarian diets, other people need some meat,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:54:02</a>:</strong>  I think that it's it's it really depends, you know, on the person on his DNA on what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:02">0:54:02-0:54:07</a>:</strong>  his ancestors ate. You know, if you're like an Eskimo, who your parents, you know, your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:07">0:54:07-0:54:12</a>:</strong>  your line, your family line, always ate a lot of fat, you're probably going to need<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:18">0:54:18-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  see what works for you, what works best. And, you know, as long as your calories are in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:30</a>:</strong>  place, you're getting a decent amount of protein. And you find what works best for you, you'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:30">0:54:30-0:54:36</a>:</strong>  be healthy. In terms of being mentally healthy, you know, of course, nutrition and exercise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:36">0:54:36-0:54:45</a>:</strong>  will support that a lot. But it's also about, for me, especially for men, you know, I mean,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:45">0:54:45-0:54:49</a>:</strong>  probably for women as well, but I'm going to talk as a guy for men, I think we need<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:49">0:54:49-0:54:55</a>:</strong>  to have a mission in life, you know, because we're hunters, we're, you know, we're used<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:54:55">0:54:55-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  to getting outside and, you know, having our sword or our bow or something and, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  having a mission, I think that is essential. And finding a way to enjoy your work, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:13</a>:</strong>  know, I'm not saying that everybody has to be like extremely passionate about his work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:13">0:55:13-0:55:18</a>:</strong>  Now, I understand that some people can do that, you know, some people have families<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:18">0:55:18-0:55:25</a>:</strong>  and might have to do a type of work that they they don't feel that this was, you know, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:25">0:55:25-0:55:30</a>:</strong>  they were meant for. But it's not always practical, you know, to just quit your job and go after<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:30">0:55:30-0:55:36</a>:</strong>  your passion and stuff like that. But I do think that it is possible to learn to enjoy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:36">0:55:36-0:55:41</a>:</strong>  your work. You know, what I figured out was that the reason I didn't enjoy my work was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:41">0:55:41-0:55:46</a>:</strong>  because I wasn't trying to be good at it. You know, once you go into this different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:46">0:55:46-0:55:53</a>:</strong>  mindset that I'll try to do my work in the best way possible, I find that you also start<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:53">0:55:53-0:55:58</a>:</strong>  to enjoy work a lot more because, you know, if you're just hating your job and you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:55:58">0:55:58-0:56:03</a>:</strong>  not trying to improve things, you don't have a goal. You just go to every day to the office<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:03">0:56:03-0:56:08</a>:</strong>  and it's boring and it doesn't give you this purpose. But when you try to do it, OK, how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:08">0:56:08-0:56:16</a>:</strong>  can I be the best at my job? You know, even if my job is, I don't know, as simple as like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:16">0:56:16-0:56:21</a>:</strong>  working on a computer or cleaning streets or whatever, you know, I think that if you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:21">0:56:21-0:56:26</a>:</strong>  get in that mindset of, OK, how can I get as good as possible every day? How can I refine<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:26">0:56:26-0:56:32</a>:</strong>  a little bit the way I do things? You know, how can I get better at these things? I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:32">0:56:32-0:56:37</a>:</strong>  that's when even a job that you don't like can be a lot more enjoyable. So then we find<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:37">0:56:37-0:56:42</a>:</strong>  a way to enjoy your work because it's something that takes like one third of your life. So<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:42">0:56:42-0:56:49</a>:</strong>  if you hate it, you know, you I don't see a way that you can't end up being miserable.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:56:54">0:56:54-0:57:00</a>:</strong>  find a hobby, even if that's 15 minutes per day. Find something that you do for yourself.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:08">0:57:08-0:57:18</a>:</strong>  my since I was really young, I was pretty not a believer. You know, I was a pretty much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:18">0:57:18-0:57:27</a>:</strong>  an atheist growing up in a community, in a town where everybody was super Christian Orthodox.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:27">0:57:27-0:57:30</a>:</strong>  You know, it's funny, I was talking about this a few days with my mother when I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:30">0:57:30-0:57:36</a>:</strong>  in when I was 10 or 11 years old. You know, I saw this documentary about the Big Bang<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:36">0:57:36-0:57:43</a>:</strong>  Theory. And in school, we had a lot of classes about religion, which wasn't really religion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:43">0:57:43-0:57:49</a>:</strong>  It was Christian Orthodox religion. And I one time I got up in the class and I said<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:49">0:57:49-0:57:55</a>:</strong>  like, like, all this is false. You know, there is no God. And I believe that everything we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:55">0:57:55-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  know from science that everything started from the Big Bang. And I started seeing these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:05</a>:</strong>  things and, you know, seeing those things in 1993 in a super small town with teachers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:05">0:58:05-0:58:11</a>:</strong>  that were on average 60 years old and not believing in not being a Christian Orthodox<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:11">0:58:11-0:58:18</a>:</strong>  wasn't even an option. I obviously got expelled from school. So I started my life being pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:18">0:58:18-0:58:26</a>:</strong>  much an atheist. And that's the the approach I took until I was 27 when I realized that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:26">0:58:26-0:58:31</a>:</strong>  you know, being absolutely, you know, knowing, saying that, you know, I know that there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:31">0:58:31-0:58:37</a>:</strong>  nothing else. And, you know, we just come from nothing and go back to nothing. I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:37">0:58:37-0:58:45</a>:</strong>  that is as fundamentalist as being like really rigidly believing in some whatever that belief<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:45">0:58:45-0:58:50</a>:</strong>  might be, that belief system. I think it's we have to be open minded. I think we have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:50">0:58:50-0:58:56</a>:</strong>  to find a way to be spiritual in order to be happy in our lives. I'm not saying that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:58:56">0:58:56-0:59:02</a>:</strong>  you have to believe in this God or that religion or you don't even have to be religious, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:02">0:59:02-0:59:08</a>:</strong>  you do definitely have to find a spiritual system for yourself, you know, even if that's,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:08">0:59:08-0:59:15</a>:</strong>  you know, believing in the force of nature or, you know, it can be as Eastern as Taoism,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:15">0:59:15-0:59:24</a>:</strong>  which, you know, or other forms of Buddhism that don't are not even a theocentric system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:24">0:59:24-0:59:29</a>:</strong>  belief. You know, you don't have to believe in a God. Just have a way, a system that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:29">0:59:29-0:59:35</a>:</strong>  you know, gives you some spiritual support. I think that that is essential if you want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:35">0:59:35-0:59:40</a>:</strong>  to be happy, if you're just like, you know, I believe in nothing or I'm really rigid in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:40">0:59:40-0:59:49</a>:</strong>  believing having this faith. I think usually both of those roads lead to unhappiness. But<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:49">0:59:49-0:59:56</a>:</strong>  I think that we definitely need to have a spiritual system to support us because, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=0:59:56">0:59:56-1:00:01</a>:</strong>  know, life will be pretty tough at times. And as strong as you think you are, life will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:01">1:00:01-1:00:09</a>:</strong>  find ways to break you down. And if you don't have at least some system of being a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:09">1:00:09-1:00:16</a>:</strong>  bit more spiritual, it's going to be pretty hard to get out of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:16">1:00:16-1:00:20</a>:</strong>  Those are really interesting insights. And it I'm struck by how much it follows along<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:20">1:00:20-1:00:25</a>:</strong>  with my own line of work, which is working with ecosystems and helping people to restore<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:25">1:00:25-1:00:31</a>:</strong>  their health, regenerate to the potential of what those ecosystems can be. And if we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:31">1:00:31-1:00:36</a>:</strong>  look at the body as the ecosystem that it is a little bit more of on a micro scale,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:36">1:00:36-1:00:41</a>:</strong>  we do need to take care of it in multiple aspects in order for it to be healthy in all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:41">1:00:41-1:00:46</a>:</strong>  of the ways that it needs to to flourish. And as you were talking about with diets,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:46">1:00:46-1:00:50</a>:</strong>  it's very context specific. Everybody's body is different. You're going to have different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:50">1:00:50-1:00:57</a>:</strong>  needs. And maybe your diet is informed by your moral compass and your bio region and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:00:57">1:00:57-1:01:02</a>:</strong>  the history and traditions that you come from. And you need to figure out what works for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:02">1:01:02-1:01:07</a>:</strong>  you. But you can still follow some guiding principles that are generally true. You know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:07">1:01:07-1:01:11</a>:</strong>  you don't have to start from scratch, not eating too much processed food, making sure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:11">1:01:11-1:01:18</a>:</strong>  that your diet is clean and as fresh and local as possible. I mean, these have really been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/anthony-aravanitakis-on-cultivating-a-holistically-healthy-lifestyle/#t=1:01:18">1:01:18-1:01:22</a>:</strong>  key to human development throughout all of our history and don't need to be reinvented<br />
