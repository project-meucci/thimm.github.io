<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:31">0:03:31-0:03:32</a>:</strong>  Thanks for being on the show.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:32">0:03:32-0:03:34</a>:</strong>  Yeah, happy to be here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:34">0:03:34-0:03:37</a>:</strong>  So before we jump into all the questions here, do you think you could tell us a little bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:37">0:03:37-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  about your background and how you got started in urban farming?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:45</a>:</strong>  Well my background is in music actually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:45">0:03:45-0:03:54</a>:</strong>  I was, for all of my 20s I was pursuing a career in music composition and I was playing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:03:54">0:03:54-0:04:01</a>:</strong>  in bands and trying to make a career out of being a music composer for film.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:01">0:04:01-0:04:07</a>:</strong>  And that kind of got tired of that in the sense that I just got tired of living in a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:07">0:04:07-0:04:10</a>:</strong>  city and doing that grind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:10">0:04:10-0:04:15</a>:</strong>  And I've always been interested in living off the grid and homesteading and kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:15">0:04:15-0:04:17</a>:</strong>  everything green.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:17">0:04:17-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  And in 2008 as the recession was hitting I really thought the world was going to shit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:24">0:04:24-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  at that point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:32</a>:</strong>  And I was like, I sort of mapped out a five-year plan at that time and wanted to start taking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:32">0:04:32-0:04:37</a>:</strong>  radical steps to working towards self-reliance in some way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:37">0:04:37-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  And so I left the city of Montreal and moved back out west which I was originally from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:04:49</a>:</strong>  And I went on a bike tour down the west coast visiting eco villages and off-grid homesteads<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:49">0:04:49-0:04:54</a>:</strong>  and organic farms just to kind of see what people were doing and what was possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:54">0:04:54-0:04:56</a>:</strong>  And I got really inspired by things that I saw.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:04:56">0:04:56-0:05:00</a>:</strong>  I didn't really learn much about that stuff on that tour but I just more or less learned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:00">0:05:00-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  a lot about myself and how incredibly powerful we can be as human beings once we put our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:07</a>:</strong>  minds to something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:07">0:05:07-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  And so I was more inspired on that trip and I came back to after that trip came back to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  BC and just wanted to start taking steps towards farming somehow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:19">0:05:19-0:05:26</a>:</strong>  And I kept running into this problem of how do you farm if you can't afford to buy land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:26">0:05:26-0:05:28</a>:</strong>  And land is really expensive where I live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:28">0:05:28-0:05:34</a>:</strong>  And so I wasn't really in a position where I could even get a mortgage to buy land because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:34">0:05:34-0:05:37</a>:</strong>  an acre of land can cost like a million dollars out here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:37">0:05:37-0:05:40</a>:</strong>  At least in the part that I live in British Columbia and this is the part that I wanted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:41</a>:</strong>  to be in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:41">0:05:41-0:05:47</a>:</strong>  And so I just I heard about these urban farmers doing farming on people's yards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:47">0:05:47-0:05:51</a>:</strong>  I heard about two people in particular and I was inspired by what they were doing and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:51">0:05:51-0:05:53</a>:</strong>  I got to know them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:53">0:05:53-0:05:59</a>:</strong>  I phoned them and I reached out and they gave me a lot of good advice and I just kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:05:59">0:05:59-0:06:01</a>:</strong>  went for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:01">0:06:01-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  And I made a living at it right away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:05</a>:</strong>  Like in my first year I was making a living at it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:05">0:06:05-0:06:12</a>:</strong>  Not a great living but good enough that I could pay for my living expenses and also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:12">0:06:12-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  have enough startup capital to go into the next season and then continue to grow the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:18</a>:</strong>  business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:18">0:06:18-0:06:21</a>:</strong>  So I did that and I grew the business for about four years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:21">0:06:21-0:06:22</a>:</strong>  I doubled it every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:22">0:06:22-0:06:23</a>:</strong>  So it got really good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:23">0:06:23-0:06:28</a>:</strong>  It got really big and then it got a little too big for what I wanted and I started to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:28">0:06:28-0:06:33</a>:</strong>  scale back and I discovered in that process that kind of doubling down on the things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:33">0:06:33-0:06:37</a>:</strong>  are working and eliminating the things that aren't was a really good business model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:37">0:06:37-0:06:39</a>:</strong>  And so that's kind of where we are today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:39">0:06:39-0:06:41</a>:</strong>  Like I've been doing this for eight years now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:46</a>:</strong>  But I really figured out how kind of following the Pareto Principle, the rule of 80-20 has<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:46">0:06:46-0:06:51</a>:</strong>  been sort of my recipe for success in all of this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:51">0:06:51-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  Now that's a really remarkable story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:54">0:06:54-0:06:57</a>:</strong>  And like you were talking about earlier, one of the unique things that you've learned how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:06:57">0:06:57-0:07:01</a>:</strong>  to do is to farm in an urban setting on borrowed or leased land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:01">0:07:01-0:07:05</a>:</strong>  Could you go into a little more detail about how you started doing that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:05">0:07:05-0:07:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:06">0:07:06-0:07:08</a>:</strong>  So I mean I wanted to farm somewhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:08">0:07:08-0:07:10</a>:</strong>  I knew that I wasn't going to buy land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:10">0:07:10-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  I was looking at like leasing land or renting land in some way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:25</a>:</strong>  And a good friend of mine told me that he had in his family had this urban lot downtown<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:25">0:07:25-0:07:29</a>:</strong>  that was pretty ideal because it had like had about 6,000 square feet of growing area<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:29">0:07:29-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  It was right downtown.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:35</a>:</strong>  And so they offered it to me and they said look if you act as sort of a caretaker of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:35">0:07:35-0:07:39</a>:</strong>  this land because they had a rental house on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:39">0:07:39-0:07:43</a>:</strong>  And they were paying somebody to come and do the lawn maintenance and all that kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:43">0:07:43-0:07:44</a>:</strong>  of stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:44">0:07:44-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  They said look if you do all that, if you take care of this, you can dig up the lawn,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  you can farm it, you can do whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:54</a>:</strong>  As long as you clean up the area around, keep it nice and tidy and grow your vegetables<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:54">0:07:54-0:07:57</a>:</strong>  and give us some veggies each week, you can just use it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:07:57">0:07:57-0:08:00</a>:</strong>  And so that's pretty much where I started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:00">0:08:00-0:08:02</a>:</strong>  And I built a home base on that site at the time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:02">0:08:02-0:08:04</a>:</strong>  I had that home base for four years there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:07</a>:</strong>  I had a little nursery there, like a 200 square foot nursery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:07">0:08:07-0:08:08</a>:</strong>  I had a little garage that I rented.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:08">0:08:08-0:08:10</a>:</strong>  I grew micro greens in there in the winter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:10">0:08:10-0:08:14</a>:</strong>  It was sort of my post-harvest area where I'd wash veggies and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:14">0:08:14-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  Had a walk-in cooler in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:17</a>:</strong>  I did most of my farming there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:17">0:08:17-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  But then I just kept getting offered other land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:19">0:08:19-0:08:24</a>:</strong>  Like people would just walk by and they would see what I was doing and they'd go wow, this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:24">0:08:24-0:08:25</a>:</strong>  is so cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:25">0:08:25-0:08:27</a>:</strong>  Why don't you come and do my yard?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:27">0:08:27-0:08:33</a>:</strong>  And so for a number of years, I just kept saying yes to everybody, which was a mistake<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:33">0:08:33-0:08:34</a>:</strong>  back then.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:34">0:08:34-0:08:36</a>:</strong>  I mean, it was great that I did it and it was great that I went through that experience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:36">0:08:36-0:08:39</a>:</strong>  of trying to grow the business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:39">0:08:39-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  But I got to a point where I just had too many plots of land all over the city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:43</a>:</strong>  They were really spread out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:43">0:08:43-0:08:48</a>:</strong>  And so that wasn't very efficient for managing a business day in and day out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:48">0:08:48-0:08:52</a>:</strong>  But that's essentially how I started was just by this one place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:52">0:08:52-0:08:58</a>:</strong>  And then by making it look really good, people just kept walking by and saying wow, what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:58">0:08:58-0:08:59</a>:</strong>  a great idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:08:59">0:08:59-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  So I did try knocking on doors to finding land when I first started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:07</a>:</strong>  But that never yielded anything because you knock on somebody's door and you're like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:07">0:09:07-0:09:08</a>:</strong>  hi, I'm Curtis.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:08">0:09:08-0:09:10</a>:</strong>  They're like, oh God, it's a Jehovah's Witness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:10">0:09:10-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  And then they immediately don't really want to talk to you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:16</a>:</strong>  So that never led to anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:16">0:09:16-0:09:21</a>:</strong>  And the moral of the story here is I always tell people is like if you want to find land<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:21">0:09:21-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  and farm in the way that I am, just start in some place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:31</a>:</strong>  Just start with one place somewhere and you'll garner a lot of interest from the community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:31">0:09:31-0:09:33</a>:</strong>  just by doing it and making it look good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:33">0:09:33-0:09:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I really love that story, especially because you talk about unexpected ways to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:38">0:09:38-0:09:41</a>:</strong>  farm different types of land within an urban setting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:41">0:09:41-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  Now for those of my listeners who would like to try and do the same, could you give us<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:45">0:09:45-0:09:51</a>:</strong>  some advice on how you go about selecting ideal land in these settings?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:51">0:09:51-0:09:55</a>:</strong>  Especially because you said before that you scaled back your operation quite a bit from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:55">0:09:55-0:09:57</a>:</strong>  having larger acreage in the beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:09:57">0:09:57-0:10:02</a>:</strong>  So I'm guessing that you have a pretty detailed list of criteria on how to select land that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:02">0:10:02-0:10:03</a>:</strong>  ideal for market gardening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:03">0:10:03-0:10:06</a>:</strong>  Yeah, sorry, are we talking about urban land?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:06">0:10:06-0:10:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah, let's stick just with urban land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:08">0:10:08-0:10:14</a>:</strong>  Okay, so if we're talking about urban land, there's sort of like a list of criteria I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:14">0:10:14-0:10:15</a>:</strong>  go through.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:15">0:10:15-0:10:20</a>:</strong>  First of all, who owns the land and are they a person that you like?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:20">0:10:20-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  That's number one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:26</a>:</strong>  If it's a person that you don't think you can deal with on a regular basis, don't farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:26">0:10:26-0:10:27</a>:</strong>  the land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:27">0:10:27-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  You have to work with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:30</a>:</strong>  Relationships are paramount to all of this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:30">0:10:30-0:10:31</a>:</strong>  You have to have good relationships.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:31">0:10:31-0:10:35</a>:</strong>  You have to find people that you want to work with and people that want to work with you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:35">0:10:35-0:10:37</a>:</strong>  and really believe in what you're doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:37">0:10:37-0:10:39</a>:</strong>  That's number one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:39">0:10:39-0:10:44</a>:</strong>  Number two would be the logistics of the site, like as far as location.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:44">0:10:44-0:10:46</a>:</strong>  Is it close to where you want to be?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:46">0:10:46-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  Like if you're farming in a multi-locational context like I am, you want your plots of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:54</a>:</strong>  land to be relatively close to one another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:54">0:10:54-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  If you have to crisscross a big city to go one plot to the other, you will waste a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:03</a>:</strong>  of time in transit and that's really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:03">0:11:03-0:11:08</a>:</strong>  My farm is really consolidated and consolidated and consolidated over the years and I'm to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:08">0:11:08-0:11:13</a>:</strong>  the point now where I'm going to be buying my neighbor's houses and eventually in maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:13">0:11:13-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  five years or so, I'll probably own all of my farm in one place and then just have a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  bunch of rental houses on it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:27</a>:</strong>  But it starts where you're taking not quite ideal places but then over time, you'll meet<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:27">0:11:27-0:11:29</a>:</strong>  more people and find more ideal places.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:29">0:11:29-0:11:32</a>:</strong>  But the location is really important, needless to say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:32">0:11:32-0:11:37</a>:</strong>  Number three is probably something like is that soil contaminated?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:37">0:11:37-0:11:39</a>:</strong>  If it's contaminated, I don't use it at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:39">0:11:39-0:11:45</a>:</strong>  If somebody says, hey, there was a gas station on this site a number of years ago, it's okay,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:45">0:11:45-0:11:46</a>:</strong>  forget about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:46">0:11:46-0:11:47</a>:</strong>  I won't even bother.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:47">0:11:47-0:11:53</a>:</strong>  If there was some like some chemicals dumped there, if there's like potential heavy metals<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:53">0:11:53-0:11:55</a>:</strong>  in the soil, I just won't use it at all.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:12:00</a>:</strong>  And that's not to say that you can't because certainly anybody listening to this who's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:00">0:12:00-0:12:06</a>:</strong>  from a bigger city in the US or Canada or even worldwide, sometimes you are going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:06">0:12:06-0:12:10</a>:</strong>  farm on sites that have contamination and you can do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:10">0:12:10-0:12:16</a>:</strong>  You can build up new organic matter and bring in a whole new bunch of soil on it, it's just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:16">0:12:16-0:12:17</a>:</strong>  costly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:17">0:12:17-0:12:21</a>:</strong>  So for me, it's just there's other lots that could be more promising.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:21">0:12:21-0:12:25</a>:</strong>  So if something's contaminated, I won't even bother using it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:25">0:12:25-0:12:30</a>:</strong>  Something like number four would be, are there any major shade structures around that site?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:36</a>:</strong>  Like if you're in a high density urban area, are there any neighboring buildings that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:36">0:12:36-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  going to cause a lot of light loss during the day?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:44</a>:</strong>  Anything on the south, if you're in the Northern Hemisphere, isn't good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:44">0:12:44-0:12:48</a>:</strong>  If you're in the Southern Hemisphere, anything on the north.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:48">0:12:48-0:12:53</a>:</strong>  You know, even if you're in the suburban or like peri-urban areas, I'm in more of a suburban<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:53">0:12:53-0:12:54</a>:</strong>  city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:54">0:12:54-0:12:58</a>:</strong>  And the biggest concern for me is trees, like other trees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:12:58">0:12:58-0:13:02</a>:</strong>  Are there big deciduous or evergreen trees around that are going to cause a lot of shade?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:02">0:13:02-0:13:05</a>:</strong>  That's really important there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:05">0:13:05-0:13:08</a>:</strong>  Something like number five is like access to water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:08">0:13:08-0:13:11</a>:</strong>  Do you have, you know, where's the water coming from?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:11">0:13:11-0:13:14</a>:</strong>  Is it a tap on a faucet on the side of the house?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:14">0:13:14-0:13:15</a>:</strong>  Is it close by?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:15">0:13:15-0:13:16</a>:</strong>  Is it accessible?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:16">0:13:16-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  That's really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:20</a>:</strong>  Maybe a number six would be access.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:20">0:13:20-0:13:23</a>:</strong>  Like how do you get in and out of that site?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:23">0:13:23-0:13:27</a>:</strong>  You know, is it really nebulous to get in there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:27">0:13:27-0:13:31</a>:</strong>  Because if you're going to be coming into this site on a daily basis or a few times<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:31">0:13:31-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  a week, you need to have good access.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  I'm kind of just going down a random list.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:37</a>:</strong>  I don't know how many I'll arrive at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:37">0:13:37-0:13:41</a>:</strong>  Number seven, I would say something like, what are the neighbors like?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:41">0:13:41-0:13:47</a>:</strong>  What's the neighborhood that that piece of land is in?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:52</a>:</strong>  Are the people around you, do you feel like there's a good level of trust in that neighborhood<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:52">0:13:52-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  and that you feel safe doing that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:00</a>:</strong>  You know, maybe a number eight would be, is there fencing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:00">0:14:00-0:14:02</a>:</strong>  Or do you need fencing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:02">0:14:02-0:14:04</a>:</strong>  Some plots you don't need fencing on, most you do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:04">0:14:04-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  And so that can be a pretty big concern.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:12</a>:</strong>  Like if you don't have any fence on there, well then anybody can walk through there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:12">0:14:12-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  Especially if it's a corner lot, then people are going to cut through and some people just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:18</a>:</strong>  won't respect your produce.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:18">0:14:18-0:14:20</a>:</strong>  They'll just walk over it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:20">0:14:20-0:14:24</a>:</strong>  And so fencing is pretty important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:24">0:14:24-0:14:27</a>:</strong>  I would say, let's leave it at that because I could probably keep going.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:27">0:14:27-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  But those would be the main eight that I would really look at before I considered any taking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:35</a>:</strong>  on a plot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:35">0:14:35-0:14:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's a really excellent list and I also really agree with the order that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:39">0:14:39-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  put them in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:40">0:14:40-0:14:43</a>:</strong>  Now, one of the keys that you've promoted to reach profitable market gardening is to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:43">0:14:43-0:14:46</a>:</strong>  select high market value crops and focus on those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:46">0:14:46-0:14:51</a>:</strong>  Can you walk us through the way that you evaluate which crops will give you the highest return<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:51">0:14:51-0:14:54</a>:</strong>  and which only seem good on the surface?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:14:54">0:14:54-0:15:00</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so basically I've narrowed it down to five characteristics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:00">0:15:00-0:15:01</a>:</strong>  There could be more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:01">0:15:01-0:15:07</a>:</strong>  Like if you were to look at other considerations when you look at a vegetable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:07">0:15:07-0:15:12</a>:</strong>  But I've narrowed it down to five that are, if you can meet three out of five or four<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:12">0:15:12-0:15:18</a>:</strong>  to five or better yet, five out of five of these characteristics, you can have a profitable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:18">0:15:18-0:15:19</a>:</strong>  crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:19">0:15:19-0:15:20</a>:</strong>  So number one is popularity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:20">0:15:20-0:15:23</a>:</strong>  The crops got to be popular and in demand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:23">0:15:23-0:15:26</a>:</strong>  Number two is days to maturity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:26">0:15:26-0:15:29</a>:</strong>  How many days does that crop take to get to harvest?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:29">0:15:29-0:15:33</a>:</strong>  I'm targeting generally something that's 60 days or less.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:33">0:15:33-0:15:36</a>:</strong>  Number three is yield per linear foot in bed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:36">0:15:36-0:15:44</a>:</strong>  So I want to get at least half a pound per foot in my 30 inch beds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:44">0:15:44-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  Number four is price per pound.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:50</a>:</strong>  So I want to get something that is like four dollars a pound or higher.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:50">0:15:50-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  And then number five is seasonality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:15:56</a>:</strong>  So how long and how much of the season can I grow that crop?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:15:56">0:15:56-0:16:00</a>:</strong>  Like winter squash, you plant it in May, you don't harvest it until August.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:00">0:16:00-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  Whereas leafy greens and baby root vegetables, like a lot of the crops that I grow, I can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:09</a>:</strong>  plant and harvest them for eight months of the year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:09">0:16:09-0:16:16</a>:</strong>  So basically, with those five criteria, that is my sort of the lens that I put everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:16">0:16:16-0:16:17</a>:</strong>  through.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:17">0:16:17-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  It's sort of a filter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:25</a>:</strong>  And what I tell farmers is that the smaller your farm, the more of those criteria you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:25">0:16:25-0:16:26</a>:</strong>  want to meet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:32</a>:</strong>  So if you want to farm and make money and make a living off, say a quarter acre of land,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:32">0:16:32-0:16:37</a>:</strong>  you need to pick crops that are going to score five out of five of that criteria.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:37">0:16:37-0:16:43</a>:</strong>  Whereas if you are on, say, an acre of land, you could probably go down to crops that are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:43">0:16:43-0:16:45</a>:</strong>  low as two out of five.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:45">0:16:45-0:16:48</a>:</strong>  You might have a garden variety there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:48">0:16:48-0:16:52</a>:</strong>  Because generally on a larger farm, you need to have more diversity to move that product,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:52">0:16:52-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  unless you've got some really sweet market stream where you're very specialized and somebody's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:17:00</a>:</strong>  buying hundreds or thousands of pounds of salad greens from you a week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:00">0:17:00-0:17:03</a>:</strong>  But that's unlikely for most market growers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:03">0:17:03-0:17:05</a>:</strong>  Generally we're targeting direct consumer market streams.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:05">0:17:05-0:17:10</a>:</strong>  So that's basically what I tell most farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:10">0:17:10-0:17:16</a>:</strong>  A lot of urban farmers who come into this come from permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:16">0:17:16-0:17:18</a>:</strong>  And that's exactly where I came from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:18">0:17:18-0:17:22</a>:</strong>  And we come in all wide-eyed and bushy tailed and we want to grow all kinds of cool stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:22">0:17:22-0:17:27</a>:</strong>  for all kinds of various reasons, but it's just not practical.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:27">0:17:27-0:17:31</a>:</strong>  And again, at the end of the day, you got to pay bills.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:31">0:17:31-0:17:38</a>:</strong>  So we all might have some kind of ideals about not wanting to be on the grid and not wanting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:41</a>:</strong>  to pay bills, but the reality is you do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:41">0:17:41-0:17:46</a>:</strong>  Especially if you have children or you have a family to support, you have to pay bills.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:46">0:17:46-0:17:49</a>:</strong>  So unfortunately the world works in dollars and cents.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:49">0:17:49-0:17:53</a>:</strong>  So if your farm isn't making money, you're not going to last very long.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:53">0:17:53-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  And that's just the hard truth that I've seen played out many times with not only myself,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:03</a>:</strong>  but dozens of farmers that I've consulted for around North America.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:03">0:18:03-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  Fantastic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:11</a>:</strong>  Now, another often overlooked aspect to profitable urban farming is setting up economical infrastructure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:11">0:18:11-0:18:16</a>:</strong>  for starting, maintaining and processing your plants for market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:16">0:18:16-0:18:19</a>:</strong>  What have been some of the most essential tools and equipment that have made your job<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:19">0:18:19-0:18:21</a>:</strong>  a lot easier and more efficient?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:21">0:18:21-0:18:28</a>:</strong>  Okay, so I guess you're referring to like the post-harvest stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:28">0:18:28-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  So I mean really you need to have a walk-in cooler, at least one walk-in cooler if you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:35</a>:</strong>  going to run a commercial farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:35">0:18:35-0:18:38</a>:</strong>  Like don't even consider trying to do it without.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:38">0:18:38-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  Some people think they can get away with using refurbished home refrigerators.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  You can't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:46</a>:</strong>  Just trust me on this one, it doesn't work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:46">0:18:46-0:18:49</a>:</strong>  I've seen people try it over and over again and they just suffer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:49">0:18:49-0:18:54</a>:</strong>  So you need to have a walk-in cooler because you can throw big totes of product in there<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:54">0:18:54-0:18:58</a>:</strong>  right off the field and you need to cool product when it's harvested to get the field heat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:18:58">0:18:58-0:19:01</a>:</strong>  off it, otherwise it starts to degrade.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:01">0:19:01-0:19:07</a>:</strong>  That makes it so you can market that product for a few three or four days or potentially<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:07">0:19:07-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  a week after it was harvested.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:13</a>:</strong>  If your product is going to spoil the next day, then your window of selling it is one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:13">0:19:13-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:20</a>:</strong>  So you can't really farm, like reasonably economically farm without proper cold storage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:20">0:19:20-0:19:22</a>:</strong>  So that's number one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:22">0:19:22-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  Things like washing infrastructure, you know we've got quite a bit of really specialized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:30</a>:</strong>  and do-it-yourself stuff on our farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:30">0:19:30-0:19:34</a>:</strong>  I mean if people go to my YouTube channel, if they just search urban farmer Curtis Stone,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:34">0:19:34-0:19:35</a>:</strong>  they'll see a lot of the stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:35">0:19:35-0:19:40</a>:</strong>  You can just use the search on my channel and put in like post-harvest and you'll get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:40">0:19:40-0:19:41</a>:</strong>  all kinds of stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:41">0:19:41-0:19:44</a>:</strong>  But one that's really important for us is a washing table.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:44">0:19:44-0:19:50</a>:</strong>  So it's basically just a three foot by eight foot wide table that has a galvanized steel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:50">0:19:50-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  mesh on it, but it also has a pool liner underneath that deflects the water when we wash into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:19:59</a>:</strong>  a bin that has a pump and we pump that water off the property.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:19:59">0:19:59-0:20:03</a>:</strong>  So that's like our wastewater really, but we actually use it to irrigate some of our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:03">0:20:03-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  perennial crops around on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:10</a>:</strong>  But so we wash like our root veggies on there, any kind of wet work is done on that table.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:10">0:20:10-0:20:12</a>:</strong>  That table is very important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:12">0:20:12-0:20:15</a>:</strong>  It's sort of the centerpiece in our whole post-harvest area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:15">0:20:15-0:20:19</a>:</strong>  And then we've got like all of our infrastructure for washing greens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:19">0:20:19-0:20:23</a>:</strong>  And greens is like the majority of what we produce on our farm, it's probably like 80%<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:23">0:20:23-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  of what we produce.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:28</a>:</strong>  And then we've got a greens washing machine called a bubbler.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:28">0:20:28-0:20:30</a>:</strong>  It's basically like a big jacuzzi.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:30">0:20:30-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  You put greens in it and then it makes air bubbles and it shakes all the dirt and bugs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:37">0:20:37-0:20:43</a>:</strong>  and stuff off the greens and then from there they go into a spinner, just a big salad spinner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:43">0:20:43-0:20:44</a>:</strong>  I have two of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:44">0:20:44-0:20:50</a>:</strong>  They're just modified washing machines that have big bins in them that spin.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:50">0:20:50-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  And this spins it just like you would any home salad spinner but on a commercial scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:21:00</a>:</strong>  And then our greens go onto another screen after that with fans on it that's called a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:00">0:21:00-0:21:01</a>:</strong>  greens dryer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:01">0:21:01-0:21:06</a>:</strong>  And that just gets any standing water off the greens, makes them a little bit drier<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:06">0:21:06-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  so that they pack better and that they last longer on the shelf.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:14</a>:</strong>  And that's the majority of our washing infrastructure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:14">0:21:14-0:21:17</a>:</strong>  We have infrastructure for packing product.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:17">0:21:17-0:21:23</a>:</strong>  We've got scales and benches and bags and all that kind of stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:23">0:21:23-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  But that's mostly what's in our post-harvest area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:30</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's really important and it's something that people often overlook, which is just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:30">0:21:30-0:21:34</a>:</strong>  how much effort and work goes into making your products presentable enough to actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:34">0:21:34-0:21:37</a>:</strong>  sell well at market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:37">0:21:37-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  It's funny because you're dead on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  It's the number one thing that I find people overlook and they think they can kind of wait<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  till the end to do that stuff and then they suffer the classic burnout is that summer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:21:55</a>:</strong>  comes on and they got lots of product coming off the field and they don't have a place<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:21:55">0:21:55-0:22:02</a>:</strong>  to put it or a proper system in place to wash it and process it and pack it and store it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:02">0:22:02-0:22:08</a>:</strong>  And the number one thing I tell all of my consulting clients or students is that if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:08">0:22:08-0:22:13</a>:</strong>  you're going to take some time to prepare your farm, get your land in production, get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:13">0:22:13-0:22:20</a>:</strong>  your land getting prepared quickly like rototill it, tarp it or whatever you're going to do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:20">0:22:20-0:22:23</a>:</strong>  and then start working on your post-harvest infrastructure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:23">0:22:23-0:22:27</a>:</strong>  Your post-harvest infrastructure should be finished well before you have crops coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:27">0:22:27-0:22:28</a>:</strong>  off the field.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:28">0:22:28-0:22:30</a>:</strong>  Yeah, for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:30">0:22:30-0:22:31</a>:</strong>  That's super important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:31">0:22:31-0:22:35</a>:</strong>  Now because you select crops that mature and can be harvested quickly, many of which even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:35">0:22:35-0:22:40</a>:</strong>  offer multiple cuttings and harvest before replanting, you've been able to put in a system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:40">0:22:40-0:22:46</a>:</strong>  of high rotation beds and manage the organization and yields for better consistency.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:46">0:22:46-0:22:49</a>:</strong>  Can you break down that system for us and give an example of how it works through a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:49">0:22:49-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  growing season?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:22:53</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:53">0:22:53-0:22:55</a>:</strong>  So you know a bit about my book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:55">0:22:55-0:22:59</a>:</strong>  You're using my terminology which is great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:22:59">0:22:59-0:23:04</a>:</strong>  So high rotation essentially means an area that is in high rotation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:04">0:23:04-0:23:08</a>:</strong>  So everything on our farm is a standardized 30-inch bed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:08">0:23:08-0:23:09</a>:</strong>  The length varies a little bit.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:09">0:23:09-0:23:13</a>:</strong>  For the most part, we have 50-foot beds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:13">0:23:13-0:23:16</a>:</strong>  So 30 inches wide by 50 feet long.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:16">0:23:16-0:23:21</a>:</strong>  And in order to make our farm more profitable on such a small piece of land, like we did<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:21">0:23:21-0:23:24</a>:</strong>  just over $100,000 on our third of an acre last year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:24">0:23:24-0:23:29</a>:</strong>  We did that because everything on my farm is high rotation, meaning that every single<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:29">0:23:29-0:23:33</a>:</strong>  bed on the farm will be planted on average at least four times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:33">0:23:33-0:23:38</a>:</strong>  So in the springtime, I might have a bed that's spinach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:38">0:23:38-0:23:45</a>:</strong>  So it's planted kind of 45 to 60 days past and we have harvested it once or twice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:45">0:23:45-0:23:48</a>:</strong>  So with greens, it's mostly at the very least we get two cuts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:48">0:23:48-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  So we get one cut and then it'll grow back in like seven to two weeks depending on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  time of season, get another cut and then we'll turn it under or we'll pull it out, amend<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:08</a>:</strong>  the soil with compost or some sort of organic fertilizer and then replant that bed to something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:08">0:24:08-0:24:09</a>:</strong>  else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:09">0:24:09-0:24:10</a>:</strong>  So then maybe it'll go to radishes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:10">0:24:10-0:24:16</a>:</strong>  So then those radishes are out in 30 days, we completely crop it out and then we'll turn<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:16">0:24:16-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  it over and plant something else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:20</a>:</strong>  Maybe at that point, it'll go to lettuce.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:20">0:24:20-0:24:26</a>:</strong>  Then it'll be lettuce for say 75 days including getting two or three cuts off it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:26">0:24:26-0:24:32</a>:</strong>  And then we'll pull that out, amend the soil again with some organic nutrients and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:32">0:24:32-0:24:33</a>:</strong>  plant it again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:33">0:24:33-0:24:36</a>:</strong>  Maybe at this point, it'll go to fall carrots and then those carrots will be in the ground<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:36">0:24:36-0:24:38</a>:</strong>  until October, harvest them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:38">0:24:38-0:24:42</a>:</strong>  So that's how one bed that's sort of the timeline of one bed might look like.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:42">0:24:42-0:24:48</a>:</strong>  So we're basically repeating that over hundreds of times in a season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:48">0:24:48-0:24:54</a>:</strong>  So we have on our farm, we have 70 50-foot beds on our farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:24:54">0:24:54-0:25:01</a>:</strong>  And so when I wrote my book, I basically give people an economic benchmark in that if you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:01">0:25:01-0:25:10</a>:</strong>  do high rotation planting and you've got 25 or 50-foot beds, on a 50-foot bed, you should<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:10">0:25:10-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  be able to make on average $1600 per bed per season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  So that's an average growing season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:21</a>:</strong>  I'm in North America, I'm in Canada and I have a slightly shorter season than some people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:21">0:25:21-0:25:23</a>:</strong>  in the US would.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:23">0:25:23-0:25:30</a>:</strong>  So if you add that up, so for our farm, 70 beds, all high rotation at $1600, that comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:32</a>:</strong>  to $112,000.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:32">0:25:32-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  So that's the economic potential of our farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  It doesn't mean you're going to make that, but that's the potential.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:39">0:25:39-0:25:46</a>:</strong>  And so that's the basis of what that all means is that we're continuously rotating our beds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:46">0:25:46-0:25:53</a>:</strong>  Now one thing to keep in mind is most of the crops I grow are what we call low feeders,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:25:53">0:25:53-0:26:00</a>:</strong>  like lettuce, radishes, spinach, arugula, mustard greens, turnips.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:00">0:26:00-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  Those crops are low feeders, meaning they don't actually draw that much from the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  So I mean I'm adding organic matter to my soil every time, every crop, but I'm putting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:14</a>:</strong>  more in than I'm taking out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:14">0:26:14-0:26:18</a>:</strong>  And that's important because if you're taking out more than you're putting in, then it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:18">0:26:18-0:26:20</a>:</strong>  diminishing returns and your soil is only going to get worse.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:20">0:26:20-0:26:26</a>:</strong>  But in organic farming, which I'm not a certified organic farmer, but I do follow all practices<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:26">0:26:26-0:26:28</a>:</strong>  regarding farming organically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:28">0:26:28-0:26:32</a>:</strong>  Most of my inputs that I use are organic or certified organic at least.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:32">0:26:32-0:26:37</a>:</strong>  And the idea is that you have to maintain the biology of your soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:37">0:26:37-0:26:45</a>:</strong>  An organic farm is dependent on biological processes within the soil structure to deliver<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:45">0:26:45-0:26:49</a>:</strong>  a yield from your crops, whereas in conventional farming it's not biology, it's basically just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:49">0:26:49-0:26:51</a>:</strong>  chemical or petrochemical inputs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:51">0:26:51-0:26:57</a>:</strong>  So we need to maintain that biology and we do that by making our soil better continuously.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:26:57">0:26:57-0:27:01</a>:</strong>  I'm actually really glad you got into that because that was going to be my next question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:01">0:27:01-0:27:05</a>:</strong>  Because obviously with so many high rotation beds, soil fertility must be paramount.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:05">0:27:05-0:27:10</a>:</strong>  And while I know you said that some of your main cash crops are plants that don't require<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:10">0:27:10-0:27:14</a>:</strong>  a whole lot from the soil, but you also have others like tomatoes that do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:14">0:27:14-0:27:19</a>:</strong>  And so I'm curious as to other than compost, can you talk to us a little bit about how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:19">0:27:19-0:27:26</a>:</strong>  you manage soil health and ways that help you to achieve such high yields and turnover?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:26">0:27:26-0:27:31</a>:</strong>  So basically it's not really anything, it's certainly nothing new.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:31">0:27:31-0:27:39</a>:</strong>  I don't think I've really created any new content as far as soil fertility.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:39">0:27:39-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  At the beginning of the season we put one to two inches of really good finished compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:46</a>:</strong>  into all of our beds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:46">0:27:46-0:27:49</a>:</strong>  And so that gets, doesn't get rototilled in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:49">0:27:49-0:27:53</a>:</strong>  We actually for the most part do a very shallow till.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:53">0:27:53-0:27:55</a>:</strong>  We don't rototill our beds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:55">0:27:55-0:27:57</a>:</strong>  We do sometimes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:57">0:27:57-0:27:59</a>:</strong>  Sometimes it's necessary, but we just do it at the beginning of the season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:27:59">0:27:59-0:28:06</a>:</strong>  We might be putting a cover crop like a fall rye mixed with peas in there and we'll rototill<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:06">0:28:06-0:28:09</a>:</strong>  it in that context and then shape the beds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:09">0:28:09-0:28:13</a>:</strong>  And then from there on throughout the season it's a very shallow cultivation we're doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:13">0:28:13-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  between each crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:17</a>:</strong>  And that's part of the soil fertility there too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:17">0:28:17-0:28:24</a>:</strong>  But it's a continuous adding of organic matter in the top layer of the soil profile that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:24">0:28:24-0:28:27</a>:</strong>  continuously keeps building up that loam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:27">0:28:27-0:28:32</a>:</strong>  So our basic protocol is, so at the beginning of the season we put in a thick layer of compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:32">0:28:32-0:28:33</a>:</strong>  on each bed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:33">0:28:33-0:28:39</a>:</strong>  We use a tool called a tilther that basically just tills that into the top inch of the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:39">0:28:39-0:28:43</a>:</strong>  So it doesn't really till it in, it more just mixes it in with the top layer of soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:43">0:28:43-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  And then we get a nice clean seed bed that we can plant into from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:52</a>:</strong>  And then, and then you know of course we fork the beds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:52">0:28:52-0:28:57</a>:</strong>  So before we actually put in that compost the beds get forked with a digging fork.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:28:59</a>:</strong>  We don't use a broad fork, we just use a digging fork.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:28:59">0:28:59-0:29:07</a>:</strong>  They get about 10 inches of forking down below to open up the soil, aerate the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:07">0:29:07-0:29:09</a>:</strong>  Then we've got the compost that goes on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:09">0:29:09-0:29:10</a>:</strong>  Then we're ready to plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:10">0:29:10-0:29:15</a>:</strong>  From there throughout the season we're pulling out a crop, we're amending the soil again<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:15">0:29:15-0:29:16</a>:</strong>  and planting again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:16">0:29:16-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  But what we're doing is we're not using compost at this time mostly because of logistics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:27</a>:</strong>  Because to use, to put buckets and buckets and buckets of compost on a bed each time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:27">0:29:27-0:29:29</a>:</strong>  is time consuming and quite labor intensive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:29">0:29:29-0:29:36</a>:</strong>  So through our mid-season rotations we switch to a more compact fertilizer which is, it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:36">0:29:36-0:29:42</a>:</strong>  is compost essentially but we're using a composted certified organic turkey manure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:42">0:29:42-0:29:47</a>:</strong>  And that goes, we sprinkle that on each bed after each crop.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:47">0:29:47-0:29:53</a>:</strong>  And then we fork the bed just like we did at the beginning and then we use the tilther<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:53">0:29:53-0:29:58</a>:</strong>  to do that little shallow cultivation of that fertilizer and then we replant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:58">0:29:58-0:29:59</a>:</strong>  So that's basically it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:29:59">0:29:59-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  I mean, something else that's slightly nuanced but is somewhat relevant to the discussion<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  is that, is our management of our weeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:10</a>:</strong>  So we use a technique called stale seed bedding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:10">0:30:10-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  And the basic idea is there that we are encouraging weed growth as early as we can and then we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:23</a>:</strong>  eliminating that by putting tarps on the soil and smothering the weeds out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:23">0:30:23-0:30:29</a>:</strong>  Or we're using a flame weeder tool that we walk right along the surface of the soil that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:29">0:30:29-0:30:34</a>:</strong>  boiling those little germinating weed seeds and we're managing from there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:34">0:30:34-0:30:38</a>:</strong>  And then because we're not really rototilling throughout the season, we're not bringing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:38">0:30:38-0:30:42</a>:</strong>  up new weed seeds and we're not putting down any weed seeds either.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:42">0:30:42-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  So we're kind of disrupting that whole weed cycle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:51</a>:</strong>  And we're essentially trying to tackle the weeds even before they become a problem so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:51">0:30:51-0:30:54</a>:</strong>  that we're continuously reducing our weed pressure over time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:54">0:30:54-0:30:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:30:56">0:30:56-0:31:01</a>:</strong>  Now I know one of the advantages that you've listed to growing crops in an urban environment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:01">0:31:01-0:31:04</a>:</strong>  is the easier access to the market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:04">0:31:04-0:31:09</a>:</strong>  Now what have been some of your most reliable ways of selling your produce and how can other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:09">0:31:09-0:31:13</a>:</strong>  urban farmers tap into those markets for themselves?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:13">0:31:13-0:31:17</a>:</strong>  Well I mean it really is about direct consumer market streams.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:17">0:31:17-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  At least that's how it was when I started.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:25</a>:</strong>  My farm is a lot different now even than when I wrote my book because my book is about almost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:25">0:31:25-0:31:28</a>:</strong>  three years old now from when it was written.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:28">0:31:28-0:31:34</a>:</strong>  And so I really encourage farmers when they're starting to get into direct consumer market<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:34">0:31:34-0:31:36</a>:</strong>  streams like farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:36">0:31:36-0:31:39</a>:</strong>  So direct consumer means direct to the consumer, so there's no middleman.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:39">0:31:39-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  So farmers markets, communities supported agriculture like veggie box programs and selling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:46</a>:</strong>  to like restaurants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:31:51</a>:</strong>  So that's how I started but it's not quite how it is today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:51">0:31:51-0:31:53</a>:</strong>  What was the first part of the question?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:53">0:31:53-0:31:55</a>:</strong>  Oh right, adventures to be in the city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:31:55">0:31:55-0:32:01</a>:</strong>  So the big advantage that urban farmers have over rural farmers is that they're just simply<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:01">0:32:01-0:32:02</a>:</strong>  in the marketplace.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:07</a>:</strong>  And we live in the city, the farms are in the city and people see them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:07">0:32:07-0:32:15</a>:</strong>  So that has a huge benefit in just that insofar as that people walk by and they see the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:15">0:32:15-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  And they get interested in the farm and they become your customers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:20">0:32:20-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  So it's really that simple and that's by far the biggest advantage that we have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:31</a>:</strong>  You know, when you're selling outside of the city, you've got to commute into the city<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:31">0:32:31-0:32:34</a>:</strong>  to not only deliver product but also build relationships.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:34">0:32:34-0:32:38</a>:</strong>  And it's the building of relationships that's the thing that most people don't really factor<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:38">0:32:38-0:32:41</a>:</strong>  in when they're thinking about starting a business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:41">0:32:41-0:32:47</a>:</strong>  But just like I said at the beginning when we were talking about land and finding land,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:47">0:32:47-0:32:49</a>:</strong>  relationships are the most important part.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:49">0:32:49-0:32:56</a>:</strong>  Because if you don't, those relationships are paramount to everything you do going forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:32:56">0:32:56-0:33:01</a>:</strong>  Because without good relationships, you don't have continuous customers or you don't have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:01">0:33:01-0:33:03</a>:</strong>  reoccurring customers I should say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:03">0:33:03-0:33:10</a>:</strong>  And so you need to have those and you know, farming is becoming, it can be competitive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:10">0:33:10-0:33:12</a>:</strong>  It's certainly very competitive where I live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:12">0:33:12-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  I don't encourage anybody to come to Kelowna to start a market garden.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:17</a>:</strong>  It's extremely competitive here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:17">0:33:17-0:33:20</a>:</strong>  There's so many organic growers here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:20">0:33:20-0:33:25</a>:</strong>  So it's good to be in a marketplace that is a little bit less saturated for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:25">0:33:25-0:33:29</a>:</strong>  But you know, if you have a niche, you can pretty much go anywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:29">0:33:29-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  If you're a really good people person and you're good at building relationships, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:33:34</a>:</strong>  can succeed anywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:34">0:33:34-0:33:38</a>:</strong>  But that's not often where many farmers are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:38">0:33:38-0:33:41</a>:</strong>  But certainly the biggest advantage we have in the city is the fact that people see our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:41">0:33:41-0:33:48</a>:</strong>  farm and we're accessible and we're you know, people get that connection to where their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:48">0:33:48-0:33:49</a>:</strong>  food comes from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:49">0:33:49-0:33:50</a>:</strong>  And I think that's really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:50">0:33:50-0:33:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I totally agree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:52">0:33:52-0:33:56</a>:</strong>  And that's another one of those aspects that like you said, a lot of people overlook.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:33:56">0:33:56-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  Especially in that urban setting, relationship building is going to be absolutely key to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:05</a>:</strong>  selling directly to your customers and not missing out on some profits that would otherwise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:05">0:34:05-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  be taken by the middleman.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:08</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:08">0:34:08-0:34:11</a>:</strong>  So there certainly is disadvantages.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:11">0:34:11-0:34:18</a>:</strong>  I mean, one is that you've got, well, you've got to deal with the city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:18">0:34:18-0:34:27</a>:</strong>  You've got to deal with bureaucracy or you know, zoning issues.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:27">0:34:27-0:34:32</a>:</strong>  If you're in the US, HOAs which are, we're so lucky we don't have those in Canada.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:32">0:34:32-0:34:34</a>:</strong>  Those are so draconian.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:34">0:34:34-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  I've been able to do a lot of what I've been able to do because we don't have HOAs and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:45</a>:</strong>  we actually have a very progressive city that really supports entrepreneurialism.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:45">0:34:45-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  So my city's been very supportive of, not supportive because they've never given me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:34:50</a>:</strong>  anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:50">0:34:50-0:34:53</a>:</strong>  Actually they've given me some awards but they've never given me money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:53">0:34:53-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  I've never asked for money either but they've just, they've kind of got out of the way and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:34:59</a>:</strong>  let me kind of do my thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:34:59">0:34:59-0:35:05</a>:</strong>  But that can certainly be a big barrier if you're farming in the city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:05">0:35:05-0:35:09</a>:</strong>  Another is if you're multi-locational, you've got logistics of managing that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:09">0:35:09-0:35:13</a>:</strong>  So you have to run around from place to place opposed to just having one single site which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:13">0:35:13-0:35:18</a>:</strong>  would certainly make it easier and eventually I might move on to a single site or I'm actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:18">0:35:18-0:35:25</a>:</strong>  trying to do it by buying my neighbor's homes and consolidating my farm into one place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:25">0:35:25-0:35:29</a>:</strong>  You know, you've got things like vandalism or theft which has actually never been an<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:29">0:35:29-0:35:35</a>:</strong>  issue for us but they can be in certain places for certain people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:35">0:35:35-0:35:40</a>:</strong>  We've been really fortunate that that's, you know, nobody's ever vandalized or stolen anything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:40">0:35:40-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  from my garden.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:45</a>:</strong>  At least to my knowledge having said that if somebody were to go in and take a few radishes,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:45">0:35:45-0:35:48</a>:</strong>  I probably wouldn't even notice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:48">0:35:48-0:35:50</a>:</strong>  I would say those are the main things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:50">0:35:50-0:35:55</a>:</strong>  I mean, another one that is an advantage and a disadvantage is the heat island effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:35:55">0:35:55-0:36:01</a>:</strong>  So I mean, it's a great advantage on the shoulder season when you want to get crops in the ground<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:01">0:36:01-0:36:07</a>:</strong>  earlier and you know, I've got 45 more frost free days in downtown Kelowna than people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:07">0:36:07-0:36:11</a>:</strong>  who are just outside the city do because the city has a heat island effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:11">0:36:11-0:36:15</a>:</strong>  It's called where it's a thermal mass that absorbs heat and it holds heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:15">0:36:15-0:36:18</a>:</strong>  So the cities are, you know, on average five degrees warmer than they are outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:18">0:36:18-0:36:20</a>:</strong>  So that's an advantage and a disadvantage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:20">0:36:20-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  It's a disadvantage in the summer because it is significantly hotter in the city than<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:25</a>:</strong>  it is outside.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:25">0:36:25-0:36:34</a>:</strong>  So for example, the last few weeks, it's been, we got up to 107 degrees Fahrenheit or 40<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:34">0:36:34-0:36:43</a>:</strong>  degrees Celsius downtown and it was 32 degrees or under 100, like 92 or something like that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:43">0:36:43-0:36:44</a>:</strong>  outside the city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:44">0:36:44-0:36:46</a>:</strong>  So it can work both ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:46">0:36:46-0:36:49</a>:</strong>  In the summer, it's certainly a disadvantage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:49">0:36:49-0:36:51</a>:</strong>  So those would be the main ones I think of right off the top of my head.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:51">0:36:51-0:36:55</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I could definitely see how those would get in the way but it sounds like you've got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:36:55">0:36:55-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  a good system of dealing with them or at least mitigating them for your circumstances.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:03</a>:</strong>  Now I want to get back to one of the things that you talked about right at the beginning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:03">0:37:03-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  of this podcast and that's that you've been able to pretty much double your revenue for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:08">0:37:08-0:37:13</a>:</strong>  each successive year since the beginning and I was wondering if you could talk about some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:13">0:37:13-0:37:16</a>:</strong>  of the key things that you've done in order to achieve that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:16">0:37:16-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  Yes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:18</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:18">0:37:18-0:37:21</a>:</strong>  So that is all about doubling down on the 80-20.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:21">0:37:21-0:37:26</a>:</strong>  So the 80-20, for those of you who don't know, the Pareto Principle is, I won't explain the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:26">0:37:26-0:37:29</a>:</strong>  history of the Pareto Principle though if you're interested looking it up, you should<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:29">0:37:29-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  look it up because it is very interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:35</a>:</strong>  I find it's actually a universal principle everywhere in the world but basically looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:35">0:37:35-0:37:39</a>:</strong>  at what delivers the most value for the least amount of input.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:39">0:37:39-0:37:45</a>:</strong>  So many people will say 20% of your customers are 80% of your business, 20% of your products<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:45">0:37:45-0:37:49</a>:</strong>  will be 80% of your revenue, so on and so forth.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:49">0:37:49-0:37:56</a>:</strong>  And so, what I've done is I've essentially applied the 80-20 to everything on my farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:37:56">0:37:56-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  from products to seed varieties to customers to methodology in the field, everything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:14</a>:</strong>  Anything that was delivering say 20% for 80% input, we got rid of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:14">0:38:14-0:38:20</a>:</strong>  And so, I've only keep the things that are meeting that 80-20 criteria.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:20">0:38:20-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  And so, the one thing like in the first number of years, it was things like, okay, let's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:26">0:38:26-0:38:28</a>:</strong>  just like refine our crop selection.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:28">0:38:28-0:38:30</a>:</strong>  Let's make our crop selection better.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:38</a>:</strong>  So the biggest milestone I had there was from my fourth year to my fifth year in farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:38">0:38:38-0:38:42</a>:</strong>  My fourth year, I had eight people working on the operation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:42">0:38:42-0:38:49</a>:</strong>  We had two and a half acres and I grew about 90 different types of crops, like including<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:49">0:38:49-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  varieties and all that kinds of stuff and it's very diversified.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:38:59</a>:</strong>  But I discovered in that year that there was 10 crops that were literally bringing in 80%<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:38:59">0:38:59-0:39:01</a>:</strong>  of the revenue over the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:01">0:39:01-0:39:04</a>:</strong>  So I radically restructured my operation that year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:04">0:39:04-0:39:07</a>:</strong>  I dropped 80 of those crops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:07">0:39:07-0:39:14</a>:</strong>  I pretty much went with 10 and I made more money that year, worked less and had a way<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:14">0:39:14-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  better quality of life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:16">0:39:16-0:39:22</a>:</strong>  So ever since then, the things that I've doubled down on, I mean, I've continuously refined<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:22">0:39:22-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  what I'm growing and what I'm not growing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  But the thing that really made a considerable effort in the later years was doubling down<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  on the types of customers that I wanted.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:39</a>:</strong>  So it was basically identifying out of all the customers I had, so let's say for example,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:39">0:39:39-0:39:43</a>:</strong>  I would have say 20 different restaurants I was selling to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:43">0:39:43-0:39:47</a>:</strong>  I had a CSA box program and I had a farmer's market every Saturday.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:47">0:39:47-0:39:52</a>:</strong>  I basically looked at that, all those revenue streams, so those are three revenue streams<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:52">0:39:52-0:39:58</a>:</strong>  there, and I said, okay, of the restaurants, let's eliminate the customers that are really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:39:58">0:39:58-0:40:00</a>:</strong>  high maintenance and are low volume.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:00">0:40:00-0:40:06</a>:</strong>  So if it's a chef and they take up a lot of my time, they don't pay their bills on time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:06">0:40:06-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  and they don't even order that much stuff, they're gone.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:14</a>:</strong>  Just forget about it, not even engaging them anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:14">0:40:14-0:40:19</a>:</strong>  With the other market streams in recent years, like last year, we dropped our farmer's market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:25</a>:</strong>  Three years before that, I dropped my CSA and then I pretty much specialized in restaurants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:25">0:40:25-0:40:30</a>:</strong>  and then I started selling more to food aggregators, like food hubs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:30">0:40:30-0:40:34</a>:</strong>  I basically buy product from local farmers and then redistribute it in a box program<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:34">0:40:34-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  and then I started selling to grocery stores.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  And so that was pretty much it there, was continuously finding the gravy, like finding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:44</a>:</strong>  the cream.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:44">0:40:44-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  Like what's the best return for the least amount of work?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:54</a>:</strong>  And I always find looking at sort of the customer, I call it the customer spectrum, it's like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:54">0:40:54-0:40:56</a>:</strong>  you've got...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:40:56">0:40:56-0:41:01</a>:</strong>  I break it down to two categories, how much maintenance they require and how much volume<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:01">0:41:01-0:41:02</a>:</strong>  they buy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:02">0:41:02-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  So a customer that is low maintenance and high volume, meaning that they're easy to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:12</a>:</strong>  deal with and they buy a lot of product, that is like your all-star number one customer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:12">0:41:12-0:41:16</a>:</strong>  Customers in the middle might be high maintenance, but they buy high volume so you'll tolerate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:16">0:41:16-0:41:22</a>:</strong>  them because at the end of the day, they might spend $1,000 a week, they're worth your time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:22">0:41:22-0:41:27</a>:</strong>  even though they might send you 10 or 20 text messages a week, they're still worth it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:27">0:41:27-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  And then on the cutoff point, on the other end, you've got low volume and high maintenance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:35</a>:</strong>  customers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:35">0:41:35-0:41:37</a>:</strong>  So they don't buy a lot, but they're high maintenance to deal with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:37">0:41:37-0:41:41</a>:</strong>  Cut those ones out immediately and then decide where you want to draw the line on the others.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:41">0:41:41-0:41:46</a>:</strong>  Even recently, in recent years for us, I've cut out a lot of customers that were high<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:46">0:41:46-0:41:50</a>:</strong>  maintenance and high volume because to me, life is short.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:50">0:41:50-0:41:55</a>:</strong>  And I've been in business long enough now that we've got sort of an incumbent status<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:41:55">0:41:55-0:42:00</a>:</strong>  where we are with our farm that nobody's really going to come in and out-compete us, at least<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:00">0:42:00-0:42:05</a>:</strong>  without us getting a really good idea of what was happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:05">0:42:05-0:42:07</a>:</strong>  So that I'm just not really so worried about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:07">0:42:07-0:42:09</a>:</strong>  To me, it's more about quality of life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:09">0:42:09-0:42:13</a>:</strong>  Like sure, it's great to make a lot of money on the farm, but at the end of the day, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:13">0:42:13-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  want to have time to spend with my daughter and my family and I want to enjoy what I'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:19</a>:</strong>  doing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:19">0:42:19-0:42:23</a>:</strong>  And if there's a customer that I don't enjoy dealing with, I just don't engage them anymore.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:23">0:42:23-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  That's really fantastic advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:29</a>:</strong>  And I know even for myself and also for many of the people that I've interviewed on this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:29">0:42:29-0:42:34</a>:</strong>  podcast that that 80-20 principle has been absolutely key for them to actually turn a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:34">0:42:34-0:42:39</a>:</strong>  profit in their business and get away from an enterprise that's really just letting them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:39">0:42:39-0:42:40</a>:</strong>  get by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:40">0:42:40-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  So what would be some advice that you would give to someone who wanted to get started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:42:46</a>:</strong>  farming in the city for themselves?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:46">0:42:46-0:42:49</a>:</strong>  What would be some of the first steps that you would advise them to take?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:49">0:42:49-0:42:54</a>:</strong>  Well I would say right off the bat, this is something I don't think I've ever said in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:42:54">0:42:54-0:43:01</a>:</strong>  an interview, is do you really need to farm in the city for one?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:01">0:43:01-0:43:08</a>:</strong>  A lot of people come to urban agriculture because it's hip, like it's cool to farm in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:08">0:43:08-0:43:13</a>:</strong>  the city and it certainly is and there is a lot to be said about the quality of life<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:13">0:43:13-0:43:18</a>:</strong>  and getting to know people in your community and neighborhood, that's really awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:18">0:43:18-0:43:23</a>:</strong>  But if you have an opportunity to farm slightly outside of the city and you've got more of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:23">0:43:23-0:43:30</a>:</strong>  an ideal situation as far as logistics and land go, there's nothing wrong with that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:30">0:43:30-0:43:35</a>:</strong>  I think a half hour commute into a town isn't really that big of a deal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:35">0:43:35-0:43:38</a>:</strong>  Whereas a couple hours, certainly that's something else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:38">0:43:38-0:43:43</a>:</strong>  But a half hour isn't so bad, you can almost be farming in the city in that same context.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:43">0:43:43-0:43:55</a>:</strong>  So, if you're going to farm in the city, you want to really figure out an ideal logistical<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:55">0:43:55-0:43:57</a>:</strong>  land base.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:43:57">0:43:57-0:44:05</a>:</strong>  If you're too spread out, then it's going to cause a lot of inefficiencies and wasted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:05">0:44:05-0:44:08</a>:</strong>  time in transit, so that's really key.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:08">0:44:08-0:44:12</a>:</strong>  Another thing is you have to utilize mini-monocultures.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:12">0:44:12-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  A lot of people who come into this from permaculture, they think that everything has to be like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:25</a>:</strong>  a forest garden or like this ultimate biodiverse little garden and it doesn't because in a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:25">0:44:25-0:44:26</a>:</strong>  city there's actually a lot of biodiversity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:26">0:44:26-0:44:30</a>:</strong>  You got trees, you got neighbors gardens, you got all things around you, all kinds of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:30">0:44:30-0:44:35</a>:</strong>  things around you that a 500 square foot plot of spinach isn't a monoculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:35">0:44:35-0:44:38</a>:</strong>  It's a mini-monoculture within a greater biodiversity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:38">0:44:38-0:44:46</a>:</strong>  So, for the sake of making things logistical and simple, it's way easier to have little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:46">0:44:46-0:44:50</a>:</strong>  specialized monocultures and you'll rotate them throughout the season, but that's really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:50">0:44:50-0:44:52</a>:</strong>  important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:44:52">0:44:52-0:45:00</a>:</strong>  A lot of urban farmers I see too, they get into it because it's like a social justice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:00">0:45:00-0:45:02</a>:</strong>  thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:02">0:45:02-0:45:09</a>:</strong>  And I think that's fine as far as intent, but it doesn't really deliver on the end.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:09">0:45:09-0:45:15</a>:</strong>  That if that's your mission and at the end of the day you don't have a business, then<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:15">0:45:15-0:45:18</a>:</strong>  you're not even going to succeed at the social justice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:18">0:45:18-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  So, you need to make a business a business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:25</a>:</strong>  And then all those other things that you want to do, whether they be good things in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:25">0:45:25-0:45:32</a>:</strong>  community, environmental things, or economic sustainability and so on and so forth, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:32">0:45:32-0:45:35</a>:</strong>  have to make a sustainable business first.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:35">0:45:35-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  Because if you don't, you won't last and you won't achieve those other goals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:38">0:45:38-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  So I'd say those would be the main ones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:44</a>:</strong>  And I mean, I guess lastly, get the right equipment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:45:49</a>:</strong>  I see some urban farmers, I'm not kidding you, that have been farming for like five<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:49">0:45:49-0:45:52</a>:</strong>  years and they're still sowing seeds with their fingertips.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:52">0:45:52-0:45:53</a>:</strong>  That's insane.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:53">0:45:53-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  Get the right equipment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:56</a>:</strong>  Get a walk-in cooler.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:56">0:45:56-0:45:58</a>:</strong>  Get a good post-harvest station.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:58">0:45:58-0:45:59</a>:</strong>  Get the right tools.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:45:59">0:45:59-0:46:00</a>:</strong>  Make sure you've got a seeder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:00">0:46:00-0:46:03</a>:</strong>  Make sure you've got good infrastructure to start a nursery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:03">0:46:03-0:46:08</a>:</strong>  Because you can kill so much time without that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:08">0:46:08-0:46:10</a>:</strong>  And these tools have been around for a long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:10">0:46:10-0:46:12</a>:</strong>  There's really nothing new.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:12">0:46:12-0:46:17</a>:</strong>  Of course there's lots of new stuff out there that is absolutely game changing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:17">0:46:17-0:46:20</a>:</strong>  But start with, you need to have a seeder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:20">0:46:20-0:46:24</a>:</strong>  Start with some of the basic infrastructure and then work up to the other things as you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:24">0:46:24-0:46:27</a>:</strong>  get some capital cushion from your operation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:27">0:46:27-0:46:30</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's fantastic advice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:30">0:46:30-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  Like you said, cutting out all of these things that people aren't taught in maybe their permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:39</a>:</strong>  design courses or general gardening courses but are essential to actually making it a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:39">0:46:39-0:46:40</a>:</strong>  business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:40">0:46:40-0:46:41</a>:</strong>  I'm really glad you touched on those.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:41">0:46:41-0:46:47</a>:</strong>  Now I personally am just such a huge fan of your book, your YouTube channel and even the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:47">0:46:47-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  courses that you offer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:46:53</a>:</strong>  How can people get in touch with you and learn more about urban farming and market gardening?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:46:53">0:46:53-0:47:01</a>:</strong>  The basic hub to find out about anything I'm doing is just go to my website, theurbanfarmer.co.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:47:15">0:47:15-0:47:19</a>:</strong>  I'm kind of taking a little hiatus until the fall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:47:19">0:47:19-0:47:24</a>:</strong>  But you can basically find most of my stuff just by going to my website there.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:01">0:49:01-0:49:04</a>:</strong>  So before we wrap up this show for the week, I've got some exciting news about the upcoming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:04">0:49:04-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  months.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:05">0:49:05-0:49:09</a>:</strong>  And I'm joined here now with my good friend and founder of Atitlan Organics, Shad Goodsy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:09">0:49:09-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  Hey buddy, what's new?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:14</a>:</strong>  Oh man, so much is happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:14">0:49:14-0:49:17</a>:</strong>  First off though, I just want to say thanks for having me, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:17">0:49:17-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  I really love your podcast and I actually had a great time doing that interview back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:23</a>:</strong>  in one of the earlier episodes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:23">0:49:23-0:49:27</a>:</strong>  Anyway, probably what's most exciting is our new collaboration between Atitlan Organics<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:27">0:49:27-0:49:29</a>:</strong>  and Abundant Edge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:29">0:49:29-0:49:33</a>:</strong>  As you know, we've been offering permaculture design courses for over six years now and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:33">0:49:33-0:49:37</a>:</strong>  they really have become a staple here in Lake Atitlan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:37">0:49:37-0:49:42</a>:</strong>  In particular though, the intro to permaculture course is just an amazing way for travelers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  gardeners, architects, basically anyone to fully immerse themselves in this new paradigm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:50</a>:</strong>  of permaculture design.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:50">0:49:50-0:49:55</a>:</strong>  Like honestly, you can't take this course and still see the world the same way afterward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:55">0:49:55-0:49:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah, that's for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:56">0:49:56-0:49:57</a>:</strong>  It's life changing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:49:57">0:49:57-0:50:02</a>:</strong>  But like I said, what I'm most excited about is that now, thanks to our collaboration,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:02">0:50:02-0:50:08</a>:</strong>  we're going to be able to offer your natural building course immediately after every one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:08">0:50:08-0:50:10</a>:</strong>  of our intro to permaculture courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:10">0:50:10-0:50:15</a>:</strong>  Literally, this two week offering is like possibly the most complete package that I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:15">0:50:15-0:50:18</a>:</strong>  know of available anywhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:18">0:50:18-0:50:22</a>:</strong>  Basically with these two courses alone, I think that someone should have everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:22">0:50:22-0:50:28</a>:</strong>  they need to start their own regenerative project or just their own regenerative lifestyle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:28">0:50:28-0:50:29</a>:</strong>  That's what I'm excited about, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:29">0:50:29-0:50:31</a>:</strong>  But yeah, what about you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:31">0:50:31-0:50:32</a>:</strong>  What's going on?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:32">0:50:32-0:50:36</a>:</strong>  Man, well, you know already that me and the Abundant Edge team are gearing up for a big<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:36">0:50:36-0:50:37</a>:</strong>  season as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:37">0:50:37-0:50:42</a>:</strong>  I mean, starting in November, we'll be breaking ground on a regenerative farming demonstration<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:42">0:50:42-0:50:45</a>:</strong>  site, which is of course right down the hill from your farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:45">0:50:45-0:50:50</a>:</strong>  We'll be building animal pens, a classroom, outdoor kitchens and lounge areas connected<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:50">0:50:50-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  to houses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:54</a>:</strong>  And it's all going to be made out of natural materials.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:54">0:50:54-0:50:59</a>:</strong>  I mean, the site is going to serve as a demonstration farm for perennial and regenerative farming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:50:59">0:50:59-0:51:01</a>:</strong>  methods for years and years to come.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:01">0:51:01-0:51:05</a>:</strong>  And we'll even be offering courses and internship opportunities to people who want to learn<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:05">0:51:05-0:51:11</a>:</strong>  for themselves about how to build with natural materials and set up their own farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:11">0:51:11-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  Heck yeah, that sounds amazing, man.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:17</a>:</strong>  And honestly, this is just about the best place in the world to learn all these things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:17">0:51:17-0:51:18</a>:</strong>  too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:18">0:51:18-0:51:22</a>:</strong>  I mean, this little town of Sununah in the gorgeous tropical mountains of Guatemala,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:22">0:51:22-0:51:26</a>:</strong>  like right here on the shores of Lake Atitlan, it's one of the most beautiful places in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:26">0:51:26-0:51:27</a>:</strong>  world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:27">0:51:27-0:51:31</a>:</strong>  And on top of that, you have this traditional indigenous Mayan culture that's still rich<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:31">0:51:31-0:51:32</a>:</strong>  and alive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:32">0:51:32-0:51:38</a>:</strong>  And probably my favorite part is that we have this world international community of alternative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:38">0:51:38-0:51:43</a>:</strong>  people that are open to new ideas and really putting things into practice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:43">0:51:43-0:51:47</a>:</strong>  I mean, within walking distance of the bamboo guest house, you've got loads of things going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:47">0:51:47-0:51:48</a>:</strong>  on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:48">0:51:48-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  We got the projects that we've already talked about, but you also have yoga retreat centers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:51:55</a>:</strong>  You have Charlie Rendell's natural bamboo building school.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:51:55">0:51:55-0:52:01</a>:</strong>  You have Love Probiotics, you have Fungi Academy and honestly loads more alternative blow your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:01">0:52:01-0:52:02</a>:</strong>  mind type stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:02">0:52:02-0:52:05</a>:</strong>  I honestly just feel like this is where it's all happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:05">0:52:05-0:52:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it really does.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:07">0:52:07-0:52:11</a>:</strong>  And I want to get as many people as possible in on these projects, but we've got to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:11">0:52:11-0:52:13</a>:</strong>  sure that they've got the skills first.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:13">0:52:13-0:52:14</a>:</strong>  So what do you say?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:14">0:52:14-0:52:17</a>:</strong>  Let's offer a big discount to those who sign up for both courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:17">0:52:17-0:52:21</a>:</strong>  I mean, all food and lodging and the amazing bamboo guest house is already included in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:21">0:52:21-0:52:22</a>:</strong>  the tuition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:22">0:52:22-0:52:25</a>:</strong>  So this will be like the best deal that we've ever offered.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:25">0:52:25-0:52:29</a>:</strong>  That's a great idea because I mean, people can still take just one course if that's what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:29">0:52:29-0:52:33</a>:</strong>  they're into or if they can't make the full two weeks, but this will actually make the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:33">0:52:33-0:52:37</a>:</strong>  two courses more accessible to even a wider audience of people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:37">0:52:37-0:52:42</a>:</strong>  That way more people can get the knowledge that they need to get started doing what they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-curtis-stone/#t=0:52:42">0:52:42-0:52:43</a>:</strong>  want to do.<br />
