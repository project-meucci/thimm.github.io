<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:43:54">0:43:54-0:43:57</a>:</strong>  They pay a dollar for me.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:06">0:44:06-0:44:09</a>:</strong>  For sure, what about you, Michael, and the different avenues to market that you found<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:09">0:44:09-0:44:16</a>:</strong>  in order to basically keep as much of the revenue into the farm as possible?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:16">0:44:16-0:44:19</a>:</strong>  Well first of all, I think Mark's right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:19">0:44:19-0:44:23</a>:</strong>  If you're going to direct market, you have to have the personality or the desire to do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:23">0:44:23-0:44:24</a>:</strong>  that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:24">0:44:24-0:44:25</a>:</strong>  You have to want to be in that situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:25">0:44:25-0:44:28</a>:</strong>  And frankly, not everybody does.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:28">0:44:28-0:44:36</a>:</strong>  And some people get into farming because they want more isolation, not social interaction.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:36">0:44:36-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  So the nature of what we do requires that we do a lot of direct marketing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  The return is higher.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:44:54</a>:</strong>  However, there is a significant investment if you're going to do farmer's markets of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:44:54">0:44:54-0:44:58</a>:</strong>  time and displays, et cetera.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:03">0:45:03-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  We have a box program.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:11">0:45:11-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  Both have well over anywhere in the range of 150 to 200 members in a box program.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:23</a>:</strong>  We do two farmer's markets a week at Fox Club.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:23">0:45:23-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  And in Vancouver, there's three.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:33</a>:</strong>  We also have sales to restaurants, or we did, I should say.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:33">0:45:33-0:45:38</a>:</strong>  That ended a year ago, sadly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:38">0:45:38-0:45:45</a>:</strong>  And all of those things, the nature of your marketing informs the nature of what you grow,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:45">0:45:45-0:45:49</a>:</strong>  what you grow, and how you grow it to some degree.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:49">0:45:49-0:45:53</a>:</strong>  All these things are tied together in kind of a web.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:45:53">0:45:53-0:46:01</a>:</strong>  So these are good questions because the ecology, the marketing, the economy, the crop mix,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:01">0:46:01-0:46:03</a>:</strong>  all these things are connected.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:07">0:46:07-0:46:15</a>:</strong>  In December, when I'm ordering seed, I'm actually pre-visualizing my display at the farmer's<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:43</a>:</strong>  of the products we grow, on a heavy emphasis on direct marketing and community involvement.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:43">0:46:43-0:46:48</a>:</strong>  And I do, while I used to wholesale when I was in California, I don't think there's anything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/farm-economics-with-mark-shepard-and-michael-ableman-expert-panel-5/#t=0:46:48">0:46:48-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  anymore that I load up on pallets and forklift onto trucks.<br />
