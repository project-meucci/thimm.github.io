<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:16">0:01:16-0:01:20</a>:</strong>  Now after years of highlighting and promoting the knowledge, wisdom, and projects of innovators<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:20">0:01:20-0:01:24</a>:</strong>  and leaders in regenerative living through this podcast, I've realized that this audio<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:31">0:01:31-0:01:34</a>:</strong>  That's why I've started the Abundant Edge YouTube channel.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:01:45">0:01:45-0:01:48</a>:</strong>  My goal is to show as many people as I can reach that you don't have to have a lot<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:01">0:02:01-0:02:04</a>:</strong>  Ya in the highlands of Guatemala.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:04">0:02:04-0:02:07</a>:</strong>  More than 30 years ago, the land where the village is located was owned by a plantation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:07">0:02:07-0:02:12</a>:</strong>  owner who kept the ecosystem under monoculture cultivation and exploited the local people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:15</a>:</strong>  who worked for slave wages on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:15">0:02:15-0:02:19</a>:</strong>  After the owner defaulted on his loans, the bank repossessed the land and offered it back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:19">0:02:19-0:02:22</a>:</strong>  to the local workers as payment for the wages owed to them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:22">0:02:22-0:02:27</a>:</strong>  The villagers then redistributed their terrain among the original 80 families who took back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:27">0:02:27-0:02:31</a>:</strong>  control of the plantation and divided it equally between themselves so they might care for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:31">0:02:31-0:02:34</a>:</strong>  it and create a better life for their families.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:02:34">0:02:34-0:02:38</a>:</strong>  Now decades later, the descendants of these pioneers have helped transform the land into<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:34">0:03:34-0:03:38</a>:</strong>  different viewpoints and analysis in order to shed light on some of the lesser known<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:38">0:03:38-0:03:43</a>:</strong>  factors that influence how we eat and how our dietary choices shape the food industry<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:43">0:03:43-0:03:44</a>:</strong>  at large.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:44">0:03:44-0:03:49</a>:</strong>  To kick off this series I spoke with John Steinman, author of the new book Grocery Store,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:49">0:03:49-0:03:53</a>:</strong>  The Promise of Food Co-ops in the Age of Grocery Giants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:53">0:03:53-0:03:57</a>:</strong>  Now John has studied and worked with Everything About Food for more than 20 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:03:57">0:03:57-0:04:02</a>:</strong>  He formally produced and hosted a popular podcast called Deconstructing Dinner and was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:02">0:04:02-0:04:05</a>:</strong>  a writer and host for a web series by the same name.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:05">0:04:05-0:04:12</a>:</strong>  He also now curates the annual Deconstructing Dinner Film Festival of compelling food documentaries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:12">0:04:12-0:04:18</a>:</strong>  John was also an elected director from 2006 to 2016 of the Kootenay Co-op, Canada's largest<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:18">0:04:18-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  independent retail consumer food co-op, serving as board president from 2014 to 2016.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  Now I consider myself fairly well informed about the food industry from personal research<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:33</a>:</strong>  and the fact that in the last decade I've worked directly in many branches of the industry<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:33">0:04:33-0:04:39</a>:</strong>  from refrigerated shipping, industrial farms, organic farms, fish processing, many different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:39">0:04:39-0:04:43</a>:</strong>  roles in restaurants, and even the permaculture farm that many of you have heard me talk about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:43">0:04:43-0:04:44</a>:</strong>  for over a year now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:44">0:04:44-0:04:48</a>:</strong>  But I never knew so much about the influence that the giant grocery chains and supermarkets<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:48">0:04:48-0:04:53</a>:</strong>  have on every aspect of our food from how it's grown all the way till it gets to our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:53">0:04:53-0:04:54</a>:</strong>  plates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:54">0:04:54-0:04:58</a>:</strong>  Now this is a very eye-opening look not only at the broken aspects of the food industry<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:04:58">0:04:58-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  but the very tangible and accessible solutions that co-op grocery stores can be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:02">0:05:02-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  Not only for getting access to better food and transforming the way the industry is incentivized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:11</a>:</strong>  to operate, but also for the positive impact that co-ops can have on our communities and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:11">0:05:11-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  local economies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:17</a>:</strong>  We also talk about solutions for access to high quality food for low income neighborhoods<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:17">0:05:17-0:05:18</a>:</strong>  and much more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:18">0:05:18-0:05:22</a>:</strong>  So before I give it all away, I'll hand things over now to John.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:22">0:05:22-0:05:26</a>:</strong>  Hey John, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us here today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:26">0:05:26-0:05:27</a>:</strong>  How are you doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:27">0:05:27-0:05:28</a>:</strong>  Doing really well, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:28">0:05:28-0:05:29</a>:</strong>  Thanks Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:29">0:05:29-0:05:32</a>:</strong>  Enjoying the spring coming in here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:32">0:05:32-0:05:33</a>:</strong>  So where are you calling in from?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:33">0:05:33-0:05:35</a>:</strong>  Sorry, I didn't even check in before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:35">0:05:35-0:05:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well I'm in Nelson, British Columbia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:38">0:05:38-0:05:46</a>:</strong>  So that's pretty much as far away from any major city that you can find in southern British<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:46">0:05:46-0:05:47</a>:</strong>  Columbia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:47">0:05:47-0:05:51</a>:</strong>  So I'm about eight hours east of Vancouver, about seven hours west of Calgary, not too<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:51">0:05:51-0:05:54</a>:</strong>  far north of the US border.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:54">0:05:54-0:05:55</a>:</strong>  Ah, gotcha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:05:55">0:05:55-0:06:00</a>:</strong>  Yeah, see I haven't actually been through that area, though I have family in Vancouver<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:00">0:06:00-0:06:02</a>:</strong>  and the Calgary area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:02">0:06:02-0:06:06</a>:</strong>  But we've had volunteers here at the farm from there and from everything I've heard<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:06">0:06:06-0:06:07</a>:</strong>  it's gorgeous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:07">0:06:07-0:06:10</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's what drew me out here in the first place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:10">0:06:10-0:06:16</a>:</strong>  You know, I grew up in Ontario and came out here about 13, 14 years ago now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:16">0:06:16-0:06:18</a>:</strong>  And you know, it's a small place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:18">0:06:18-0:06:22</a>:</strong>  There's about 10,000 people in the city, maybe another 10,000 in the surrounding area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:22">0:06:22-0:06:27</a>:</strong>  But you know, people come here from all over Canada, all over the United States and a few<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:27">0:06:27-0:06:29</a>:</strong>  other places from around the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:29">0:06:29-0:06:33</a>:</strong>  And so there's a bit of a cosmopolitan feel in a small community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:33">0:06:33-0:06:34</a>:</strong>  Marvelous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:34">0:06:34-0:06:37</a>:</strong>  Well, hey, look, I've got a ton of questions that I would really love to ask you about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:37">0:06:37-0:06:40</a>:</strong>  your new book, Grocery Store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:40">0:06:40-0:06:43</a>:</strong>  And there's just so much to unpack from the topics here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:43">0:06:43-0:06:45</a>:</strong>  So what do you say we just jump into the questions?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:45">0:06:45-0:06:46</a>:</strong>  Let's jump into the questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:46">0:06:46-0:06:52</a>:</strong>  But hey, let me first tell you that the title, it's funny, you know, the title of the book<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:52">0:06:52-0:06:54</a>:</strong>  is Grocery Story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:54">0:06:54-0:06:59</a>:</strong>  And it's been this interesting journey so far in this early stage of having published<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:06:59">0:06:59-0:07:02</a>:</strong>  or just about to publish a book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:02">0:07:02-0:07:04</a>:</strong>  You know, the name is Grocery Story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:04">0:07:04-0:07:10</a>:</strong>  And it's interesting how many people see Grocery Store and certainly online as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:10">0:07:10-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  Google wants to autocorrect every time you type in grocery story, it wants to autocorrect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:17</a>:</strong>  at the grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:17">0:07:17-0:07:21</a>:</strong>  So I'm so glad you corrected me because like I did notice that when I was reading through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:21">0:07:21-0:07:23</a>:</strong>  it and it just slipped my mind as I was saying it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:23">0:07:23-0:07:24</a>:</strong>  I'm kind of tired today.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:24">0:07:24-0:07:26</a>:</strong>  So thank you for clarifying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:26">0:07:26-0:07:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:27">0:07:27-0:07:30</a>:</strong>  You know, I think it's going to be something I'll be doing for the next year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:30">0:07:30-0:07:36</a>:</strong>  Well, let's see if we can justify that screw up and redeem myself later on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:36">0:07:36-0:07:40</a>:</strong>  How about we start by getting a little bit of your background and tell me how you became<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:40">0:07:40-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  interested in defining food systems and how the story of grocery chains and the expansion<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:07:54</a>:</strong>  of their monopoly has really had an impact on the food system that we interact with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:54">0:07:54-0:07:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's a good question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:07:56">0:07:56-0:08:01</a>:</strong>  And you know, in the book, I share quite a bit of my personal journey into this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:01">0:08:01-0:08:07</a>:</strong>  And I think I felt that I wanted to share a bit of that personal story because by and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:07">0:08:07-0:08:12</a>:</strong>  large there isn't a lot written about grocery stores, which is fascinating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:12">0:08:12-0:08:17</a>:</strong>  You know, there was a book that came out a couple of years ago that does dive deep into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:17">0:08:17-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  the grocery store sector.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:19">0:08:19-0:08:23</a>:</strong>  But beyond that one title, there wasn't much and isn't much out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:23">0:08:23-0:08:28</a>:</strong>  And so I felt compelled to share a little bit of my personal story because for me, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:28">0:08:28-0:08:33</a>:</strong>  have been a food journalist for the better part of the past 15 years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:33">0:08:33-0:08:39</a>:</strong>  You know, I started writing restaurant reviews and diving a bit more into the sort of culinary<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:39">0:08:39-0:08:40</a>:</strong>  side of things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:40">0:08:40-0:08:45</a>:</strong>  And it was really my appreciation of food that kind of drew me into looking, as you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:45">0:08:45-0:08:50</a>:</strong>  say, more into what might be considered food systems, which I imagine most of your listeners<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:50">0:08:50-0:08:56</a>:</strong>  are familiar with, which is really all of the parts making up, getting food from the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:08:56">0:08:56-0:09:02</a>:</strong>  farm, even all the inputs that go into the farm, getting food from the farm to our kitchens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:02">0:09:02-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  And all of those moving parts in between would be considered the food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:11</a>:</strong>  And my first foray beyond just eating and appreciating food, my first kind of entry<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:11">0:09:11-0:09:16</a>:</strong>  into that was studying at the University of Guelph for four years where I studied restaurant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:16">0:09:16-0:09:18</a>:</strong>  and hotel management.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:18">0:09:18-0:09:23</a>:</strong>  And it was there I developed this appreciation for food, but it was also there where I started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:23">0:09:23-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  to really learn how disconnected the various parts of the food system were from one another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:34</a>:</strong>  So here I was learning how to manage a restaurant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:34">0:09:34-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  And yet all of the pieces beyond the walls of that restaurant weren't really being shown<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:44</a>:</strong>  to me, in particular, where all the food was coming from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:44">0:09:44-0:09:50</a>:</strong>  And it was a fascinating thing that it took me years to eventually realize how disconnected<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:50">0:09:50-0:09:54</a>:</strong>  this was, because not only was I learning this at the University of Guelph, but I was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:09:54">0:09:54-0:10:01</a>:</strong>  doing it right beside the largest agricultural school in the entire country and all of Canada.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:01">0:10:01-0:10:06</a>:</strong>  And so when I left university after those first four years, that really began this journey<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:06">0:10:06-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  of trying to learn more about, you know, what are all these pieces that make up the food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:13</a>:</strong>  system?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:13">0:10:13-0:10:19</a>:</strong>  And in particular, I wanted to learn why is it the food that I started to appreciate the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:19">0:10:19-0:10:23</a>:</strong>  most, which was the most local, freshest food possible?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:23">0:10:23-0:10:28</a>:</strong>  Why was it so difficult to find that food at grocery stores near my home?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:28">0:10:28-0:10:34</a>:</strong>  And so that was back in 2004, where I really started to ask those questions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:34">0:10:34-0:10:40</a>:</strong>  A couple years before really this kind of real strong interest in local food first began.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:40">0:10:40-0:10:46</a>:</strong>  And it took many years before I really started to appreciate just how important the grocery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:46">0:10:46-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  store piece of the food system is, you know, I spent many years hosting a radio show and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:54</a>:</strong>  podcast like yours.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:10:54">0:10:54-0:11:00</a>:</strong>  I spent, you know, 40 hours a week researching everything about the food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:00">0:11:00-0:11:04</a>:</strong>  And it took me many years to finally realize, wait a minute, you know, there's this one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:04">0:11:04-0:11:08</a>:</strong>  piece within the food system that doesn't really get a lot of attention, you know, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:08">0:11:08-0:11:11</a>:</strong>  a lot of attention going into farmers markets, a lot of attention going into growing our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:11">0:11:11-0:11:17</a>:</strong>  own food, cultivating, you know, that relationship directly with with growing food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:17">0:11:17-0:11:24</a>:</strong>  And yet, this one very penetrating strand of the food system where, you know, by and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:24">0:11:24-0:11:30</a>:</strong>  large, and I've sort of, you know, as I say in the book, calculated 94% of all food purchases<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:30">0:11:30-0:11:36</a>:</strong>  are going through grocery stores, or some form of food retailer, you know, why is it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:36">0:11:36-0:11:40</a>:</strong>  this very penetrating strand of the food system hasn't received a lot of attention.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:40">0:11:40-0:11:47</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, that in a nutshell is sort of the journey I took to finally get there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:47">0:11:47-0:11:51</a>:</strong>  That is fascinating, because so many people have come from different directions and points<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:51">0:11:51-0:11:57</a>:</strong>  of interest or study to find a relationship and how they interact with their food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:11:57">0:11:57-0:12:00</a>:</strong>  And it's great to hear from yours as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:00">0:12:00-0:12:04</a>:</strong>  But let's focus for a second on the rise of the grocery giants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:04">0:12:04-0:12:08</a>:</strong>  And you go into great detail in this in your book, and sort of how their business models<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:08">0:12:08-0:12:14</a>:</strong>  shaped the way that we produce, distribute, buy and consume our food, because it really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:14">0:12:14-0:12:21</a>:</strong>  is a very overarching influence on every level of this industry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:21">0:12:21-0:12:22</a>:</strong>  It is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:22">0:12:22-0:12:29</a>:</strong>  And, you know, it, I think the best entry point into that, specifically into this, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:29">0:12:29-0:12:34</a>:</strong>  know, question, well, how does the grocery sector shape the food system?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:34">0:12:34-0:12:39</a>:</strong>  You know, in one example that I use in the book, is really the actual shape and structure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:39">0:12:39-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  and flavor of our food is very much determined by the demands that grocery stores place upon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:47</a>:</strong>  the food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:47">0:12:47-0:12:54</a>:</strong>  So, you know, it, in many ways, we as eaters, as consumers, we do help dictate, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:54">0:12:54-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  what ends up being grown and produced.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:13:02</a>:</strong>  But if there's only so many options available to us, whether it's the options that are on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:02">0:13:02-0:13:06</a>:</strong>  the shelf of the store, when we walk into the store, like there's three or four types<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:06">0:13:06-0:13:13</a>:</strong>  of tomatoes, or even just two or three options, grocery stores near our home, we're not really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:13">0:13:13-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  all that powerful, I guess you could say in terms of determining the food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:23</a>:</strong>  It's really the stores that are providing the choices to us that are really, as I see<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:23">0:13:23-0:13:25</a>:</strong>  it, dictating what's grown and how it's grown.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:25">0:13:25-0:13:29</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, I speak of the shape of the food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:29">0:13:29-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  So that is, in and of itself, a really good example where we can walk into a grocery store<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:38</a>:</strong>  and by and large, the conventional grocery stores, particularly that we walk into, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:38">0:13:38-0:13:44</a>:</strong>  know, you can imagine standing in front of the case or shelf of tomatoes, and usually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:44">0:13:44-0:13:46</a>:</strong>  they all pretty much look the exact same.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:46">0:13:46-0:13:52</a>:</strong>  And of course, a lot of that has to do with being able to package those in the right size<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:52">0:13:52-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  boxes for that tomato to be able to be picked when it's green, often, if it's the case of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:02</a>:</strong>  a field tomato where they're being picked green, and then they get ripened in these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:02">0:14:02-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  rooms where ethylene gas is piped into the room.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:09</a>:</strong>  And then eventually they get put onto a truck and within a few days, they'll be anywhere<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:09">0:14:09-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  in North America.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:18</a>:</strong>  In order for that tomato to be that perfect texture, that perfect firmness so that it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:18">0:14:18-0:14:28</a>:</strong>  can last in the trucks in the right temperatures, you know, it led to this very intentional<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:28">0:14:28-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  breeding program among, you know, many of the breeding programs you might find at universities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  or within some of the companies producing it themselves, producing the seeds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:47</a>:</strong>  It led to this very notable intention over the past 50, 60 years to grow a tomato to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:47">0:14:47-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  serve that interest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:14:53</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, this all really begins in the grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:53">0:14:53-0:14:57</a>:</strong>  So the grocery store is making that call and saying, you know, here's the tomato we want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:57">0:14:57-0:14:58</a>:</strong>  on the shelf.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:14:58">0:14:58-0:15:02</a>:</strong>  And then you can imagine all those pieces that extend from that all the way down to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:02">0:15:02-0:15:08</a>:</strong>  the farm, into the breeding programs and into the seed itself, it has dictated the types<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:08">0:15:08-0:15:10</a>:</strong>  of food that's available to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:10">0:15:10-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  And you know, from there, we have run the risk, and certainly this has been the case<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:24</a>:</strong>  of losing access to genetic diversity, losing access to really the diversity of flavor that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:24">0:15:24-0:15:29</a>:</strong>  I imagine all of your listeners are familiar with when it comes to, you know, more of those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:29">0:15:29-0:15:34</a>:</strong>  garden varieties of tomatoes, for example, that we can be growing, or that are growing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:34">0:15:34-0:15:41</a>:</strong>  more likely on a smaller scale on smaller farms, or in, you know, permaculture environments<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:41">0:15:41-0:15:42</a>:</strong>  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:42">0:15:42-0:15:47</a>:</strong>  So, you know, that's just one example of the grocery stores literally shaping the food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:47">0:15:47-0:15:50</a>:</strong>  that we eat right from the get go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:50">0:15:50-0:15:56</a>:</strong>  And then beyond that, you know, is less maybe tangible is the way in which having only a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:15:56">0:15:56-0:16:03</a>:</strong>  handful of grocery stores who are essentially that go between the farm and the eater, when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:03">0:16:03-0:16:09</a>:</strong>  you have only a handful of grocery stores in between the two, the farm and the eater,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:09">0:16:09-0:16:14</a>:</strong>  they pretty much are dictating what comes through in a way that that gate, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:14">0:16:14-0:16:21</a>:</strong>  I call the grocery giant gatekeepers, and they are determining, you know, how that food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:21">0:16:21-0:16:24</a>:</strong>  is going to get to you and what food is going to get.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:24">0:16:24-0:16:29</a>:</strong>  And so you know, when I talk about the power of the grocery giants to really dictate the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:29">0:16:29-0:16:35</a>:</strong>  food system, a lot of it has to do with this visual that we can imagine of a bottleneck,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:35">0:16:35-0:16:41</a>:</strong>  where, you know, you have millions of farmers around the world, and you have a billion,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:41">0:16:41-0:16:44</a>:</strong>  seven plus billion eaters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:44">0:16:44-0:16:50</a>:</strong>  And then, by and large, anywhere where we live, we usually only have up to maybe five<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:50">0:16:50-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  different grocery chains, determining what food is available to us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:17:00</a>:</strong>  And so all of the food goes through this bottleneck.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:00">0:17:00-0:17:04</a>:</strong>  And so this is the bottleneck I speak of in the book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:04">0:17:04-0:17:10</a>:</strong>  Now you mentioned how these industries have become increasingly consolidated, have really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:10">0:17:10-0:17:15</a>:</strong>  become a monopoly in many cases, to the point where I think you said there's only about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:15">0:17:15-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  five real grocery chains, and many subsidiaries within that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:27</a>:</strong>  And this is having an increasing impact, especially on consumers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:27">0:17:27-0:17:34</a>:</strong>  How have you seen sort of the progression of these monopolies affecting consumers directly?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:34">0:17:34-0:17:46</a>:</strong>  Well, you know, I think one example, I walked into my one of the chain grocers here where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:46">0:17:46-0:17:49</a>:</strong>  I live in Nelson recently.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:49">0:17:49-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  And one of the things that we're starting to see on the shelves of many of the dominant<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:54">0:17:54-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  chains is this interest in local food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:01</a>:</strong>  And it's something that is, you know, close to my heart, it's something that I care about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:03</a>:</strong>  because it's the way I choose to eat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:03">0:18:03-0:18:08</a>:</strong>  You know, I don't grow a large amount of my food, I have a small garden, I do rely on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:08">0:18:08-0:18:10</a>:</strong>  either farmers markets or grocery stores.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:10">0:18:10-0:18:17</a>:</strong>  And what's really important to me is the ability for me to be able to access local food as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:21</a>:</strong>  easily as I possibly can, and to support my neighbors and people I know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:21">0:18:21-0:18:24</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, that's something that's important to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:24">0:18:24-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  So you know, when I hear that the dominant chains are starting to invite local food onto<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  their shelves, as many of them are now trying to do, you know, that's something that generally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:41</a>:</strong>  we'd want to celebrate, because that's that many more options for consumers to access<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:41">0:18:41-0:18:42</a>:</strong>  local food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:42">0:18:42-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  And so it's heartening, though, to walk into a chain retailer, as I did not too long ago,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  and to see that instead of there being local food on the shelf that says local food, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  in fact food from places that, you know, aren't anywhere near where I live.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  And so, in some cases, this is being done within, you know, the legal definition of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:09</a>:</strong>  local, which in where I live in British Columbia, is a very widespread definition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:09">0:19:09-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  So to call something local in my community, it can come from anywhere within the province.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:18</a>:</strong>  And British Columbia is massive, it's larger than most countries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:18">0:19:18-0:19:27</a>:</strong>  So you can have food coming from, you know, 650 700 miles away, and still call it local.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:27">0:19:27-0:19:30</a>:</strong>  So that's, you know, some of the local food that's found on our chain grocers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:30">0:19:30-0:19:37</a>:</strong>  In other cases, you know, I found food that was coming from across the provincial lines<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:37">0:19:37-0:19:41</a>:</strong>  from as far away as Alberta, which legally is actually not allowed to be called local<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:41">0:19:41-0:19:42</a>:</strong>  food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:42">0:19:42-0:19:47</a>:</strong>  And yet one of our chain grocers here is calling it local food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:47">0:19:47-0:19:52</a>:</strong>  So you know, this is something that to kind of come back to your question, is challenging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:19:52">0:19:52-0:20:00</a>:</strong>  the availability of local food in our communities, because it's starting to water down this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:00">0:20:00-0:20:05</a>:</strong>  It's watering down the ability for actual local producers to market their product as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:05">0:20:05-0:20:10</a>:</strong>  local and gain value from that definition of local.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:10">0:20:10-0:20:13</a>:</strong>  So if all the chains are starting to water down local, so that local means really the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:13">0:20:13-0:20:19</a>:</strong>  entire western portion of Canada, which is very much what what the chains out here are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:19">0:20:19-0:20:24</a>:</strong>  and you know, I can say I can, I found many examples of this in the United States as well,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:24">0:20:24-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  or in Eastern Canada, then we start to lose value for those small producers who really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:29">0:20:29-0:20:34</a>:</strong>  rely on their ability to market themselves as being local.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:34">0:20:34-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  So you know, the struggle and challenge of producing local food is already on its own<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:42</a>:</strong>  struggle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:42">0:20:42-0:20:47</a>:</strong>  And it doesn't make it any easier when you have these chains that are starting to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:47">0:20:47-0:20:53</a>:</strong>  value in the name local, but in order to really deliver it genuinely, there's a need from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:53">0:20:53-0:20:56</a>:</strong>  what I see for them to water it down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:20:56">0:20:56-0:21:02</a>:</strong>  And so you have, you know, as is the subject of my book, the promise of food co-ops, so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:02">0:21:02-0:21:09</a>:</strong>  community owned grocery stores, who have genuinely generally been very transparent and integral<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:09">0:21:09-0:21:15</a>:</strong>  and honest about, you know, local food being actually from within a small local bioregion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:15">0:21:15-0:21:21</a>:</strong>  And so you have this also challenge now among our community owned grocery stores, to really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:21">0:21:21-0:21:28</a>:</strong>  to really ensure that the food that they rely on to differentiate themselves can be, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:28">0:21:28-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  know, a viable business for small scale producers to be in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:36</a>:</strong>  So this is, you know, one of the challenges right now, within the food system, and one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:36">0:21:36-0:21:42</a>:</strong>  of the ways in which these grocery stores, the chains, the grocery giants are shaping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:42">0:21:42-0:21:43</a>:</strong>  the food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:43">0:21:43-0:21:48</a>:</strong>  You know, I used the example earlier of the tomato, and there is now this example too<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:48">0:21:48-0:21:54</a>:</strong>  of shaping the ability for local food systems to thrive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:21:54">0:21:54-0:22:01</a>:</strong>  Yeah, see, this is fascinating because I remember when I first realized that many of these labels<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:01">0:22:01-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  that are put on food products to attract us to buy them, especially to attract more ethical<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:13</a>:</strong>  or conscious consumer things like all natural or local or, you know, even organic, depending<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:13">0:22:13-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  on where it is, is not protected by law the way many people would assume.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:24</a>:</strong>  And especially in cases of things like all natural, there's no standard like it doesn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:24">0:22:24-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  have to comply to anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:29</a>:</strong>  It's mostly just a marketing ploy and it sounds good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:29">0:22:29-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  And it really waters down the expectations or the standards for things that really are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:39</a>:</strong>  produced at a high quality and are handled with care along the journey.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:39">0:22:39-0:22:46</a>:</strong>  And like you said, it starts to discredit some of the legitimate products that consumers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:46">0:22:46-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  are looking for when they realize that there's not actually much meaning behind these labels.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:22:58</a>:</strong>  Well, and you know, everyone's familiar with how this happened as well with organic food,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:22:58">0:22:58-0:23:06</a>:</strong>  you know, where organic food was often for, you know, I think a long period of time, somewhat<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:06">0:23:06-0:23:09</a>:</strong>  synonymous with food that was from your area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:09">0:23:09-0:23:16</a>:</strong>  You know, generally, the organic food producers were able to just were simply market their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:16">0:23:16-0:23:20</a>:</strong>  product as organic in their local communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:20">0:23:20-0:23:24</a>:</strong>  Whereas now the same thing is happening where, you know, an organic carrot grown locally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:24">0:23:24-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  close to me here in Nelson, BC, is the same organic carrot that is grown somewhere in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:33</a>:</strong>  California, thousands of miles away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:33">0:23:33-0:23:38</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, the same thing happened with organic, as you say, you know, natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:38">0:23:38-0:23:43</a>:</strong>  is also not defined in any way whatsoever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:43">0:23:43-0:23:45</a>:</strong>  You know, anything can be considered natural.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:45">0:23:45-0:23:52</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, this, for me, is what really drew my interest into writing this book was<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:52">0:23:52-0:23:59</a>:</strong>  to, you know, was to was to take a breath in a way to take a breather and step back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:23:59">0:23:59-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  and say, Okay, well, wait a minute, you know, if the labels that we rely on to really help<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:10</a>:</strong>  communicate, you know, the food that we're eating, if these labels that we rely on, are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:10">0:24:10-0:24:14</a>:</strong>  starting to not carry the meaning that we would hope them to carry, where else can we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:14">0:24:14-0:24:21</a>:</strong>  look to, to, to find trust in our experience of shopping for food because, you know, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:21">0:24:21-0:24:28</a>:</strong>  last, I think the last thing any of us want is to go into our grocery stores or a farmers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:28">0:24:28-0:24:33</a>:</strong>  market, wherever it is, we're accessing food, the last thing we want is to feel like we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:33">0:24:33-0:24:38</a>:</strong>  in some sort of battle or we're in some sort of conflict, or we have to somehow question<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:38">0:24:38-0:24:40</a>:</strong>  everything we're buying.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:40">0:24:40-0:24:46</a>:</strong>  And I think to a degree, there is a role for eaters to be to scrutinize what we're buying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:46">0:24:46-0:24:52</a>:</strong>  to be critical of what we're buying is, but there's only so much we can we can handle,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:52">0:24:52-0:24:56</a>:</strong>  you know, we don't want to have to be the expert when we walk into the grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:24:56">0:24:56-0:25:00</a>:</strong>  I don't think that's really a real thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:00">0:25:00-0:25:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and I think generally, you know, especially if you're, you know, young parents and you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:05">0:25:05-0:25:12</a>:</strong>  have, you know, a child at home or two, three, four children at home, and you're, you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:12">0:25:12-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  shopping for your family, really, like the last thing you have time for is doing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:22</a>:</strong>  research and finding out where your food's coming from, finding out how it was grown.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:22">0:25:22-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  Like I say, I think there's a role for all of us to have a level of wisdom and knowledge<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:30</a>:</strong>  when it comes to our food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:37</a>:</strong>  But it is such a dizzying array of detail, that it's nice to be able to rely either as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:37">0:25:37-0:25:43</a>:</strong>  as at one point was to rely on a certification label to rely on a name.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:43">0:25:43-0:25:48</a>:</strong>  And of course, as we've been talking about here, that isn't always something we can be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:48">0:25:48-0:25:51</a>:</strong>  100% certain of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:51">0:25:51-0:25:54</a>:</strong>  So again, you know, I come back to, you know, what was it that drew my interest to write<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:54">0:25:54-0:25:55</a>:</strong>  this book?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:25:55">0:25:55-0:26:01</a>:</strong>  Well, part of it was because it seems to me that one place that we should be able to place<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:01">0:26:01-0:26:05</a>:</strong>  our trust in is the person selling us the food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:05">0:26:05-0:26:10</a>:</strong>  And so in this case, you know, like I say, with 94% of food purchases coming from some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:10">0:26:10-0:26:15</a>:</strong>  form of food retailer, mostly, you know, your traditional grocery store, wholesale club<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:15">0:26:15-0:26:20</a>:</strong>  or specialty food retailer, we should be able to place our trust in those people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:20">0:26:20-0:26:27</a>:</strong>  And this is where the idea of, you know, community on grocery stores first began, food co-ops,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:27">0:26:27-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  where you know, rather than feel that rather than actually be disconnected from the owner<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:36</a>:</strong>  of your store, who you then have to place trust in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:36">0:26:36-0:26:39</a>:</strong>  So that might be, you know, someone who lives in your community who owns the grocery store<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:39">0:26:39-0:26:47</a>:</strong>  or it's a chain retailer that has a head office in some far off city or some distant country,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:47">0:26:47-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  even, we can actually use the co-op model to become an owner of our grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:27:00</a>:</strong>  And so that's where, you know, this co-op movement has begun in many parts of the economy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:00">0:27:00-0:27:09</a>:</strong>  Of course, I focus on grocery retail, but it's this interest in this desire to relieve<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:09">0:27:09-0:27:17</a>:</strong>  ourselves of the challenge and the anxiety that can come from shopping for food, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:17">0:27:17-0:27:27</a>:</strong>  is not to say all food co-ops are able to be 100% perfect in purchasing food with the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:27">0:27:27-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  fullest integrity possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:36</a>:</strong>  You know, co-ops, I think generally, though, are the most integral of all the grocery stores<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:36">0:27:36-0:27:42</a>:</strong>  I've ever come across and the best thing is, is if you find that your grocery store, even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:42">0:27:42-0:27:47</a>:</strong>  if it is a food co-op is no longer being as integral as you expect it to be, you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:47">0:27:47-0:27:55</a>:</strong>  the opportunity to exert, you know, this democratic rights within your store to vote for a board<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:27:55">0:27:55-0:28:00</a>:</strong>  of directors that will then decide, you know, in most cases who the general manager of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:00">0:28:00-0:28:03</a>:</strong>  store is and who's running the store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:03">0:28:03-0:28:05</a>:</strong>  And so every member has that vote.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:05">0:28:05-0:28:10</a>:</strong>  So as a, as a member of a food co-op, you have the democratic right to vote usually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:10">0:28:10-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  once a year for your board of directors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:20</a>:</strong>  And generally members of food co-ops also have significantly more power in offering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:20">0:28:20-0:28:25</a>:</strong>  either a complaint or coming forward with a suggestion and an idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:25">0:28:25-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  No vote.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  Those ideas are almost always responded to, they're heard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:31">0:28:31-0:28:39</a>:</strong>  And the ways in which food co-ops respond to members is unheard of in any sector of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:39">0:28:39-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  the economy that I've certainly experienced as a consumer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:47</a>:</strong>  You know, this is certainly, it's a very stark juxtaposition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:47">0:28:47-0:28:52</a>:</strong>  And before we kind of unpack the structure of co-ops and all of the benefits, let's take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:52">0:28:52-0:28:58</a>:</strong>  a couple steps back for a second and talk about this rise of the regional food movement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:28:58">0:28:58-0:29:06</a>:</strong>  and how it has the potential to shift these monopolies and disturb the status quo of how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:06">0:29:06-0:29:09</a>:</strong>  our food is marketed and processed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:09">0:29:09-0:29:16</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, you know, so the, the regional food movement, the local food movement has<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:16">0:29:16-0:29:21</a>:</strong>  already done that, I think in huge ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:21">0:29:21-0:29:26</a>:</strong>  You know, there's, there's both, I think a pro and a con to what's happened with organic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:26">0:29:26-0:29:36</a>:</strong>  You know, you have vastly, these vast acreages now planted with organic food that 15, 20<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:36">0:29:36-0:29:38</a>:</strong>  years ago, weren't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:38">0:29:38-0:29:43</a>:</strong>  And you know, even if it is this sort of industrial form of organic, I think there's a lot to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:43">0:29:43-0:29:48</a>:</strong>  celebrate that those are acres that were at one point grown conventionally, and they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:48">0:29:48-0:29:52</a>:</strong>  now being grown in this using organic methods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:52">0:29:52-0:29:57</a>:</strong>  So there's that power and that's the power of the eaters, that's the power of consumers,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:29:57">0:29:57-0:30:00</a>:</strong>  that's the power of, you know, the organic food movement to have done that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:00">0:30:00-0:30:10</a>:</strong>  And the same, I think we've seen with local regional food is this power to shift what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:10">0:30:10-0:30:15</a>:</strong>  already happened within, as I mentioned earlier, the conventional chains to start to pay attention<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:15">0:30:15-0:30:16</a>:</strong>  to this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:16">0:30:16-0:30:21</a>:</strong>  You know, it was just announced that IGA, which is this like large network of independently<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:21">0:30:21-0:30:23</a>:</strong>  owned grocery stores.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:23">0:30:23-0:30:30</a>:</strong>  You know, they are now offering branding to all of their stores to begin branding what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:30">0:30:30-0:30:34</a>:</strong>  hopefully is genuinely local in their stores as being local.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:34">0:30:34-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  So this is something that emerged out of the local food movement where you have pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:30:47</a>:</strong>  much every major chain on the continent starting to pay attention to this and starting to,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:47">0:30:47-0:30:53</a>:</strong>  whether genuinely or not, hopefully mostly genuinely offer these products on the shelves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:30:53">0:30:53-0:31:01</a>:</strong>  And so that, as I see it, has grown out of all of our interest in farmers markets, in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:01">0:31:01-0:31:07</a>:</strong>  growing our own food, in developing and supporting existing infrastructure within local food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:07">0:31:07-0:31:09</a>:</strong>  systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:09">0:31:09-0:31:13</a>:</strong>  You know, so really food co-ops have been a part of that, farmers markets have been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:13">0:31:13-0:31:15</a>:</strong>  a part of that, CSAs have been a part of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:15">0:31:15-0:31:23</a>:</strong>  It is this entire network of people who are trying to preserve and develop and grow our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  local food systems that I think is trickling up and reshaping the dominant food system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:39</a>:</strong>  and starting to, and I think it will reflect itself and come back in and I think to some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:39">0:31:39-0:31:46</a>:</strong>  degrees even though, as I say earlier, I think there's a threat of that challenging local<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:31:50</a>:</strong>  food systems, I think there will also be some benefits from that where it will start to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:50">0:31:50-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  make more economical sense to be developing and growing local food based businesses because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:32:04</a>:</strong>  by and large generally the population of eaters is that much more willing and supportive of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:04">0:32:04-0:32:06</a>:</strong>  that type of food production.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:06">0:32:06-0:32:11</a>:</strong>  And I think one of the things that you said earlier that really brings it home is the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:11">0:32:11-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  emphasis of network and how each one of these pieces individually from co-ops to CSA models<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:20">0:32:20-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  to various aspects of the regional food movement, they only have a certain amount of power in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:31</a>:</strong>  and of themselves, but when they start to work together and collaborate, they really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:31">0:32:31-0:32:36</a>:</strong>  form, like you said, a network that has a lot more buying power, has a lot more effect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:36">0:32:36-0:32:41</a>:</strong>  on the consumer and can actually shift the direction that even these large monopolized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:41">0:32:41-0:32:48</a>:</strong>  grocery store chains are moving in and create awareness and respect for the fact that consumers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:48">0:32:48-0:32:55</a>:</strong>  increasingly are looking for oversight and quality assurance from the things that they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:55">0:32:55-0:32:57</a>:</strong>  buy and consume.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:32:57">0:32:57-0:33:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and I think it's the need for having that community or network of interests within<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:07">0:33:07-0:33:14</a>:</strong>  a local food system that I don't get the sense that the chains will ever be able to truly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:14">0:33:14-0:33:19</a>:</strong>  be integrated within.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:19">0:33:19-0:33:24</a>:</strong>  The model that they operate on, the way in which they compete with one another, I don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:24">0:33:24-0:33:31</a>:</strong>  think allows for enough room for them to truly be integrated into our local food systems.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:31">0:33:31-0:33:37</a>:</strong>  As much as we'd love to put our attention into regulating or legislating or just simply<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:37">0:33:37-0:33:43</a>:</strong>  demanding that chains carry more products from local producers, because obviously in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:43">0:33:43-0:33:49</a>:</strong>  many places there isn't any other option than chain grocers or farmers markets, but of course<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:49">0:33:49-0:33:55</a>:</strong>  farmers markets are maybe only once a week in our communities or in our neighborhoods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:33:55">0:33:55-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  Grocery stores, regardless of who owns them, have a responsibility in our communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:06</a>:</strong>  I don't think the chains will ever be able to integrate into our local food communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:06">0:34:06-0:34:09</a>:</strong>  the way a food co-op, for example, can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:09">0:34:09-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  One way in which we can see a grocery store, whether it's a food co-op or not, being integrated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  within a food system is the way in which some grocery stores, including chains, will actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:27</a>:</strong>  allow for their parking lot to be used as a farmers market once a week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:27">0:34:27-0:34:31</a>:</strong>  And of course that benefits both the grocery store, it benefits the farmers market, it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:31">0:34:31-0:34:38</a>:</strong>  allows for people to show up and buy food from as many local producers as possible and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:38">0:34:38-0:34:42</a>:</strong>  then get everything else that they can't find at the farmers market at the grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:42">0:34:42-0:34:48</a>:</strong>  Some chains do do that and some of the examples I share in the book, though, of food co-ops<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:48">0:34:48-0:34:54</a>:</strong>  and the way in which they integrate into the food community in their local areas is through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:34:54">0:34:54-0:35:04</a>:</strong>  support of CSAs, for example, and many food co-ops will act as drop-off points for CSAs,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:04">0:35:04-0:35:09</a>:</strong>  so many of these CSAs also don't rely entirely on selling to their shareholders, they'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:09">0:35:09-0:35:13</a>:</strong>  also rely on selling into co-ops or grocery stores as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:13">0:35:13-0:35:19</a>:</strong>  So it's a way to support these farmers who are running CSAs to also just have one drop-off<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:19">0:35:19-0:35:24</a>:</strong>  point for their produce that's going into the grocery store as well as going to their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:24">0:35:24-0:35:25</a>:</strong>  members.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:25">0:35:25-0:35:33</a>:</strong>  It also allows for the farmer to not have to stand around and deliver those bins of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:35</a>:</strong>  weekly vegetables, for example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:35">0:35:35-0:35:38</a>:</strong>  The grocery store, like many food co-ops, do do this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:38">0:35:38-0:35:45</a>:</strong>  I share some examples in the book of food co-ops who once a year will host CSA fairs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:45">0:35:45-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  So one of them is the Seward Co-op in Minneapolis, Minnesota, who will host a CSA fair where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:56</a>:</strong>  people can come and meet their farmer who they might want to invest in at the beginning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:56">0:35:56-0:35:58</a>:</strong>  of the season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:35:58">0:35:58-0:36:03</a>:</strong>  If I have my numbers correct, there's something like 40 or so farms that will show up at this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:03">0:36:03-0:36:09</a>:</strong>  event and it's a way for eaters to link up with their farmer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:09">0:36:09-0:36:16</a>:</strong>  It's actually quite remarkable that a grocery store would essentially be supporting what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:16">0:36:16-0:36:20</a>:</strong>  in the dominant marketplace would be considered the competition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:20">0:36:20-0:36:26</a>:</strong>  So you have here this grocery store that's creating this space to essentially lose customers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:26">0:36:26-0:36:31</a>:</strong>  to say, you know, we're okay with you, our customer, going and buying all of your food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:31">0:36:31-0:36:34</a>:</strong>  from this farmer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:34">0:36:34-0:36:39</a>:</strong>  But food co-ops, they understand that this is actually a benefit to them because to them<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:39">0:36:39-0:36:45</a>:</strong>  it's ensuring that their supplier, farmers supplying them with food, has the diversity<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:45">0:36:45-0:36:51</a>:</strong>  of markets to sell into, which anyone in business would want to make sure they have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:51">0:36:51-0:36:56</a>:</strong>  You never want to rely on just one customer, whether it's just relying on eaters at a farmer's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:56">0:36:56-0:36:59</a>:</strong>  market or just relying on one grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:36:59">0:36:59-0:37:04</a>:</strong>  It's important for these businesses to have a diversity of customers and it's important<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:04">0:37:04-0:37:13</a>:</strong>  for, particularly for these farmers to be able to receive 100% of the food dollar rather<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:13">0:37:13-0:37:14</a>:</strong>  than a grocery store to take some of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:14">0:37:14-0:37:22</a>:</strong>  So these food co-ops understand that in order for their suppliers that they rely on in order<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:22">0:37:22-0:37:28</a>:</strong>  to differentiate themselves from the market, in order to adhere to their values of supporting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:28">0:37:28-0:37:34</a>:</strong>  their community, they know that these farmers need these other channels to sell to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:34">0:37:34-0:37:41</a>:</strong>  It's a remarkable example of how a grocery store can be an integral part of a local food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:41">0:37:41-0:37:42</a>:</strong>  system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:42">0:37:42-0:37:47</a>:</strong>  And like I say, the chains, I don't think we'll ever be able to get to that place because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:47">0:37:47-0:37:56</a>:</strong>  they're so in the mindset of competition that the idea of being able to act as a community,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:37:56">0:37:56-0:38:00</a>:</strong>  I don't think we'll ever reach the head offices of the largest chains in the country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:00">0:38:00-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  Hmm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:04</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's a tough one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:04">0:38:04-0:38:09</a>:</strong>  Certainly when businesses get that large, they lose a lot of their flexibility or their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:09">0:38:09-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  nimbleness to react to changes in the market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:18</a>:</strong>  Now speaking of these business models, let's go back to the beginning and define what a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:18">0:38:18-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  co-op is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:25</a>:</strong>  How does it separate itself from these grocery chains that we've identified have really manipulated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:25">0:38:25-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  the food system up to this point?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:43</a>:</strong>  I think the most important way to differentiate between the two is cooperatives are within<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:43">0:38:43-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  all sectors of the economy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:49</a>:</strong>  And there are many different types of co-ops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:49">0:38:49-0:38:54</a>:</strong>  So you have cooperatives that are consumer co-ops, which are the ones that are the focus<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:54">0:38:54-0:38:55</a>:</strong>  of my book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:38:55">0:38:55-0:39:03</a>:</strong>  They're cooperatives that are owned by the people who shop and use the services of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:03">0:39:03-0:39:04</a>:</strong>  business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:04">0:39:04-0:39:10</a>:</strong>  So you can have a consumer co-op be a car share, for example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:10">0:39:10-0:39:17</a>:</strong>  So I'm a member of a car share co-op and I am a consumer of renting a vehicle, for example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:17">0:39:17-0:39:21</a>:</strong>  And same with retail food co-ops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:21">0:39:21-0:39:23</a>:</strong>  You know, I'm a consumer of the grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:23">0:39:23-0:39:24</a>:</strong>  It's a consumer co-op.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:24">0:39:24-0:39:29</a>:</strong>  Then you have worker co-ops, where it's a business that's owned by the workers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:29">0:39:29-0:39:33</a>:</strong>  You can also have a hybrid of the two, where it's a business that's owned by consumers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:33">0:39:33-0:39:35</a>:</strong>  and workers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:35">0:39:35-0:39:38</a>:</strong>  You have credit unions, which are essentially consumer co-ops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:38">0:39:38-0:39:44</a>:</strong>  They're financial institutions owned by the people who use the credit union.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:44">0:39:44-0:39:50</a>:</strong>  So this is the main difference between a co-op and a privately owned business, is that co-ops<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:39:55</a>:</strong>  are owned by the people who benefit from either the goods or services that the business is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:55">0:39:55-0:39:56</a>:</strong>  offering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:39:56">0:39:56-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  So as an owner, the biggest way to exercise your democratic right as an owner is to vote<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:12</a>:</strong>  once a year for the board of directors, which, similar to a private or publicly held company,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:12">0:40:12-0:40:17</a>:</strong>  these businesses will have investors or shareholders who are determining who the board is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:17">0:40:17-0:40:19</a>:</strong>  represents their interests.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:19">0:40:19-0:40:24</a>:</strong>  And the same thing is the case with consumer food co-ops, where once a year, as an example,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:24">0:40:24-0:40:29</a>:</strong>  I'm a member of our co-op here in Nelson, BC, the Kootenai co-op.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:29">0:40:29-0:40:34</a>:</strong>  Once a year, I'll go and vote for a board of directors who will represent my interests.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:34">0:40:34-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  At one point for 10 years, I was a board director.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:43</a>:</strong>  So I would serve a two-year term, and every two years, if I wanted to run again, I would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:43">0:40:43-0:40:49</a>:</strong>  put myself forward, make a case, just like in any sort of democratic process, as to why<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:49">0:40:49-0:40:53</a>:</strong>  I should be elected as a board director.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:53">0:40:53-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  And in many cases, these are volunteer roles or not volunteer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:41:01</a>:</strong>  There's a small stipend that board directors will receive, maybe credit at the store every<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:01">0:41:01-0:41:03</a>:</strong>  month.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:03">0:41:03-0:41:15</a>:</strong>  It's a way for you as a consumer to feel trust in the owner of your store, because it's you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:15">0:41:15-0:41:17</a>:</strong>  And that's the biggest difference.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:17">0:41:17-0:41:20</a>:</strong>  And of course, there's many other benefits.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:20">0:41:20-0:41:28</a>:</strong>  Many consumer food co-ops will return a portion of their profits to their members.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:28">0:41:28-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  So this is something that I think is really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  So when we walk into any grocery store, there might be this experience that we have that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:39</a>:</strong>  the store is trying to take advantage of us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:39">0:41:39-0:41:41</a>:</strong>  They're profiting off of us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:41">0:41:41-0:41:42</a>:</strong>  And of course, they are.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:42">0:41:42-0:41:44</a>:</strong>  That's the case.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:44">0:41:44-0:41:50</a>:</strong>  They're in the business of making a profit, as the case with a chain retailer, of sending<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:50">0:41:50-0:41:57</a>:</strong>  those profits to their shareholders, which could be people all over the planet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:41:57">0:41:57-0:42:02</a>:</strong>  But in the case of a food co-op, it's not possible for the store to take advantage of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:02">0:42:02-0:42:08</a>:</strong>  its members or consumers, because all of those profits that that co-op makes either go right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:08">0:42:08-0:42:12</a>:</strong>  back into the business that you're using and benefiting from.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:12">0:42:12-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  Many of those food dollars that we put forward at the cash are also going into community<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:22</a>:</strong>  organizations, into the community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:22">0:42:22-0:42:29</a>:</strong>  And anything that is above and beyond what might go back into the business is often,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:29">0:42:29-0:42:32</a>:</strong>  not in every case, but often returned back to the members.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:32">0:42:32-0:42:37</a>:</strong>  So there have been years where this has been the case at our co-op, where based on how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:37">0:42:37-0:42:42</a>:</strong>  much I've purchased through the year, I will get a percentage of my purchases returned<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:42">0:42:42-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:42:47</a>:</strong>  And we're not talking thousands of dollars here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:47">0:42:47-0:42:50</a>:</strong>  I've received checks for $15.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:50">0:42:50-0:42:53</a>:</strong>  I've received a check for $100 at the end of the year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:53">0:42:53-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  But as a business, this can amount to tens of thousands of dollars, if not more, that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:02</a>:</strong>  gets distributed back out into the membership.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:02">0:43:02-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  So it's not possible for a co-op to take advantage of its members.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:14</a>:</strong>  It's a beautiful business model that is something that has existed for really hundreds of years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:14">0:43:14-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  in a more sort of organized and sustained fashion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:23</a>:</strong>  I think you can really just look back about 100 years or a little more to when really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:23">0:43:23-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  this model began to be formalized and started to grow over the years through, as I described<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  in the book, through various waves of development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:41</a>:</strong>  And often they've coincided with usually economic hardship, where we start to, and I say we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:41">0:43:41-0:43:48</a>:</strong>  as in the royal we, where historically people have felt they've been getting taken advantage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:48">0:43:48-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  of, perhaps the economy has faltered in some way where you start to feel and see the hardship<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  that's being created by the systems around us, and it compels these waves of response.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:03">0:44:03-0:44:08</a>:</strong>  And cooperatives isn't the only way people have responded to those hardships, but cooperatives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:08">0:44:08-0:44:10</a>:</strong>  have certainly been one of them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:10">0:44:10-0:44:14</a>:</strong>  And that's where we've seen, at least with food co-ops, we've seen that wave.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:14">0:44:14-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  We've seen waves of food co-op development after the Great Depression.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:22</a>:</strong>  We've seen waves of food co-op development in the sort of late sixties, early seventies.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:22">0:44:22-0:44:29</a>:</strong>  And again, we're seeing again now in this period, which as I say, is a track in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:29">0:44:29-0:44:33</a>:</strong>  book, began around 2008 through now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:33">0:44:33-0:44:34</a>:</strong>  We're still seeing development.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:34">0:44:34-0:44:35</a>:</strong>  All right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:35">0:44:35-0:44:40</a>:</strong>  So now that we have co-ops kind of defined in their structure, and like you said, they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:40">0:44:40-0:44:45</a>:</strong>  can be many other things other than grocery stores, let's focus on what co-ops can do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:45">0:44:45-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  for a community other than just provide high quality food from ethical sources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:44:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:52">0:44:52-0:44:56</a>:</strong>  You know, well, that's a few chapters of the book right there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:44:56">0:44:56-0:45:03</a>:</strong>  And one that I think really stands out for me that sort of goes beyond what's on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:03">0:45:03-0:45:11</a>:</strong>  shelves of the grocery store, beyond the food, is by being a cooperative that's headquartered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:11">0:45:11-0:45:16</a>:</strong>  and located right within our community, it means that the head office of the grocery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:16">0:45:16-0:45:18</a>:</strong>  store is also in our community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:18">0:45:18-0:45:24</a>:</strong>  You know, so the model of chain retailers, regardless of what's on their shelves, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:24">0:45:24-0:45:31</a>:</strong>  know, grocery being the example here, is that you have these outposts really within communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:31">0:45:31-0:45:35</a>:</strong>  of this larger chain that is headquartered somewhere else.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:35">0:45:35-0:45:41</a>:</strong>  And so a lot of the resources that go into running that grocery store that's in our neighborhood,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:41">0:45:41-0:45:46</a>:</strong>  in our community, a lot of the resources that are needed to run it aren't within our community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:46">0:45:46-0:45:50</a>:</strong>  They're either in regional offices or in head offices.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:50">0:45:50-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  And so this is where co-ops really differentiate themselves and I think really stand out and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:46:01</a>:</strong>  really support our communities is that it places the entire head office of the grocery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:01">0:46:01-0:46:03</a>:</strong>  store, often in the store itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:03">0:46:03-0:46:13</a>:</strong>  You know, so I would say about 90% of co-ops are independent single store co-ops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:13">0:46:13-0:46:17</a>:</strong>  So that usually means the entire staff is within the store itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:17">0:46:17-0:46:21</a>:</strong>  In some cases you might have an office down the street or across the room where the head<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:21">0:46:21-0:46:27</a>:</strong>  office is, and then you have another 10% of co-ops that have multiple locations, whether<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:27">0:46:27-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  it's two locations or as large as the case with PCC approaching, I think, 15 locations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:35</a>:</strong>  soon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:35">0:46:35-0:46:39</a>:</strong>  Where in their case, you know, they do have a head office that's outside of the grocery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:39">0:46:39-0:46:44</a>:</strong>  store, but is all within the Seattle area of Washington in that example.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:44">0:46:44-0:46:49</a>:</strong>  And so of course what this means is we have that many more people employed in a grocery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:49">0:46:49-0:46:56</a>:</strong>  store than we would a pain retailer operating, you know, from a distance in our community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:46:56">0:46:56-0:47:03</a>:</strong>  So you know, if you take an example like Nelson BC and my co-op, the Kootenai co-op where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:03">0:47:03-0:47:08</a>:</strong>  I shop, like I said earlier, you know, we're a small community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:08">0:47:08-0:47:10</a>:</strong>  We have 10,000 people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:10">0:47:10-0:47:17</a>:</strong>  We're a hub for a much larger population of maybe, you know, a total of 20,000 people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:17">0:47:17-0:47:24</a>:</strong>  who sort of use Nelson as its sort of central place of shopping and commerce and work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:24">0:47:24-0:47:29</a>:</strong>  Our co-op is the largest non-governmental employer in the city.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:29">0:47:29-0:47:33</a>:</strong>  So you know, we have a Walmart in our community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:33">0:47:33-0:47:35</a>:</strong>  We employ more people than the Walmart.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:35">0:47:35-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  We employ 170 people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:44</a>:</strong>  I think it's at least 170, if not more now at the store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:44">0:47:44-0:47:51</a>:</strong>  So again, you know, the largest employer within a community of 10,000 people with 170 people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:51">0:47:51-0:47:57</a>:</strong>  employed, that's not something you would generally find in a grocery store in a community of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:57">0:47:57-0:47:58</a>:</strong>  our size.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:47:58">0:47:58-0:48:00</a>:</strong>  No, yeah, that's significant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:00">0:48:00-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  It's huge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:07</a>:</strong>  And you know, I think for a community to look at its future and to say, you know, what is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:07">0:48:07-0:48:10</a>:</strong>  it that's going to keep people here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:10">0:48:10-0:48:15</a>:</strong>  What is it that's going to sustain everything else we love about our community, which in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:15">0:48:15-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  Nelson's case is the outdoors and skiing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:21</a>:</strong>  And you know, these are things that we value here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:21">0:48:21-0:48:25</a>:</strong>  You know, what is it that's going to keep people living here and enjoying this place?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:25">0:48:25-0:48:30</a>:</strong>  Well, it's having meaningful, strong, long lasting employment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:30">0:48:30-0:48:33</a>:</strong>  And everyone needs to buy food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:33">0:48:33-0:48:37</a>:</strong>  Everyone needs to access food in some form or another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:37">0:48:37-0:48:42</a>:</strong>  And so grocery stores can service that in any community of any size, but can they actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:42">0:48:42-0:48:46</a>:</strong>  employ a significant part of the population?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:46">0:48:46-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  And the chains just simply don't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:48:55</a>:</strong>  They can't because the human resources, as in the human resource department, the marketing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:55">0:48:55-0:48:59</a>:</strong>  department, finance department, you know, all of these are located right within the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:48:59">0:48:59-0:49:01</a>:</strong>  store itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:01">0:49:01-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  And so what this means too is that the people who are making the most important decisions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:05">0:49:05-0:49:12</a>:</strong>  to the store are people who live in the community, who want to stay in the community for many<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:12">0:49:12-0:49:20</a>:</strong>  years to come, if not the rest of their lives, and have every reason to show up at work that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:20">0:49:20-0:49:24</a>:</strong>  day and put all of their energy into making sure that the decisions being made by that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:24">0:49:24-0:49:28</a>:</strong>  co-op are going to benefit them and their families and their communities for many years,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:28">0:49:28-0:49:30</a>:</strong>  if not generations to come.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:30">0:49:30-0:49:37</a>:</strong>  And those are the most important decisions tend to be made at that sort of higher, if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:37">0:49:37-0:49:43</a>:</strong>  you want to call it, level of the organization, at that managerial level, where again, those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:43">0:49:43-0:49:47</a>:</strong>  aren't decisions that are being made locally at a chain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:47">0:49:47-0:49:51</a>:</strong>  So that's just one example, but it's one that I think really stands out and it's one that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:51">0:49:51-0:49:59</a>:</strong>  easily forgotten when it comes to comparing this model of either a co-op grocery store<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:49:59">0:49:59-0:50:02</a>:</strong>  or a chain grocery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:02">0:50:02-0:50:07</a>:</strong>  Now there's another issue that's become a hot button topic, especially in recent years,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:07">0:50:07-0:50:09</a>:</strong>  and that's the idea of food deserts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:09">0:50:09-0:50:14</a>:</strong>  And I've recorded podcasts with other contributors in the past who have really highlighted this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:14">0:50:14-0:50:15</a>:</strong>  issue.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:15">0:50:15-0:50:18</a>:</strong>  And I was really drawn to this section of the book where you talked about how co-ops<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:18">0:50:18-0:50:24</a>:</strong>  can help to remediate the issue of food deserts in underserved populations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:24">0:50:24-0:50:27</a>:</strong>  Can you talk a little bit about how they're able to do that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:27">0:50:27-0:50:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and I would offer a disclaimer on that first is that I think the promise of food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:38">0:50:38-0:50:44</a>:</strong>  co-ops and the possibility of food co-ops being able to remediate food deserts, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:44">0:50:44-0:50:49</a>:</strong>  it sounds like your listeners are familiar with food deserts, but quickly for those that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:50:49">0:50:49-0:51:02</a>:</strong>  aren't, a food desert is generally defined as a neighborhood where a certain number of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:02">0:51:02-0:51:08</a>:</strong>  the population or percentage of the population is defined as low income and is more than<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:08">0:51:08-0:51:12</a>:</strong>  one mile from a full service grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:12">0:51:12-0:51:19</a>:</strong>  So we're not talking close to a convenience store or close to a fast food chain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:19">0:51:19-0:51:24</a>:</strong>  We're talking like full service grocery store where you have access to fresh produce, dairy,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:24">0:51:24-0:51:28</a>:</strong>  and all the things that we would normally consider to be a balanced diet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:28">0:51:28-0:51:34</a>:</strong>  So this would be considered a food desert if you're within more than one mile from a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:34">0:51:34-0:51:35</a>:</strong>  grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:35">0:51:35-0:51:37</a>:</strong>  In rural areas, it's upwards to 10 miles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:37">0:51:37-0:51:46</a>:</strong>  And food deserts, although that term is defined for neighborhoods that have a significant,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:46">0:51:46-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  notable low income population, it's something that does affect neighborhoods and communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:51:53</a>:</strong>  regardless of income levels.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:53">0:51:53-0:51:58</a>:</strong>  It can be a place that is of middle income or even higher income, but of course in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:51:58">0:51:58-0:52:02</a>:</strong>  middle or higher income, there's a much larger chance of having access to transportation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:02">0:52:02-0:52:08</a>:</strong>  And so the issue isn't as dire because we can hop into a vehicle and drive somewhere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:08">0:52:08-0:52:11</a>:</strong>  But of course that too is not something we want to be relying on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:11">0:52:11-0:52:18</a>:</strong>  So this idea of not having access to grocery stores is a very significant concern.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:18">0:52:18-0:52:23</a>:</strong>  Of course with food deserts, we're talking about the more dire circumstance of really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:23">0:52:23-0:52:28</a>:</strong>  not being able to access a grocery store, particularly for people without access to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:28">0:52:28-0:52:29</a>:</strong>  transportation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:29">0:52:29-0:52:34</a>:</strong>  So food co-ops as an alternative is something that I write about in the book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:34">0:52:34-0:52:42</a>:</strong>  And I should say that I had no original intention to go into this area of subject matter in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:42">0:52:42-0:52:51</a>:</strong>  the book until I started to learn of what are starting to be a small number of communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:51">0:52:51-0:52:55</a>:</strong>  who are looking at the food co-op model for that very reason.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:52:55">0:52:55-0:53:01</a>:</strong>  And so there are examples shared in the book, one in particular of a co-op in Greensboro,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:01">0:53:01-0:53:05</a>:</strong>  North Carolina, where you had a community there that had been without a grocery store<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:05">0:53:05-0:53:10</a>:</strong>  for, I don't have that number in front of me right now, but it was over 15 years, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:10">0:53:10-0:53:15</a>:</strong>  think upwards of 18 years, that the community was without a grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:15">0:53:15-0:53:22</a>:</strong>  And at some point within that time, residents had organized themselves and started to try<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:22">0:53:22-0:53:27</a>:</strong>  to encourage chain retailers to come into their neighborhood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:27">0:53:27-0:53:30</a>:</strong>  And none of them wanted to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:30">0:53:30-0:53:34</a>:</strong>  Despite the area demonstrating that you could make a profit as a grocery store, none of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:34">0:53:34-0:53:36</a>:</strong>  the chains wanted to come in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:36">0:53:36-0:53:45</a>:</strong>  And so they turned to the cooperative sector to consider that as a model to build a grocery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:45">0:53:45-0:53:46</a>:</strong>  store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:46">0:53:46-0:53:53</a>:</strong>  So to do as I described earlier, to encourage people within the community to become an owner<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:53">0:53:53-0:53:57</a>:</strong>  in your grocery store, to become a shareholder in your grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:53:57">0:53:57-0:54:00</a>:</strong>  And for many years they began developing that model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:00">0:54:00-0:54:08</a>:</strong>  And so this is something that has existed now for this particular need for not very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:08">0:54:08-0:54:09</a>:</strong>  long.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:09">0:54:09-0:54:14</a>:</strong>  And they were, and I say were because unfortunately just earlier this year they closed their doors,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:14">0:54:14-0:54:22</a>:</strong>  they were the first real substantial example of a community in that circumstance using<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:22">0:54:22-0:54:24</a>:</strong>  the co-op model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:24">0:54:24-0:54:31</a>:</strong>  And so as much as I want to say, I think this is the future and I think this is a way for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:31">0:54:31-0:54:37</a>:</strong>  these types of communities to find security in a grocery store model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:37">0:54:37-0:54:39</a>:</strong>  It's still so early on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:39">0:54:39-0:54:44</a>:</strong>  And of course we have this example here of what wanted to be a success and was a success<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:44">0:54:44-0:54:46</a>:</strong>  in many instances, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:46">0:54:46-0:54:50</a>:</strong>  That they were able to open their doors and operate for a couple of years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:50">0:54:50-0:54:53</a>:</strong>  And yet it wasn't able to sustain itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:54:53">0:54:53-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  And so I think communities of all types, including low income communities, they are looking at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:04</a>:</strong>  the co-op model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:04">0:55:04-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  I think it's still too early to tell, is this going to be a model that can work?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:11</a>:</strong>  And my personal opinion is that I think it will.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:11">0:55:11-0:55:17</a>:</strong>  I think we're just in that early stage where it's trying to figure itself out because generally<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:17">0:55:17-0:55:25</a>:</strong>  food co-ops have been much more common and almost synonymous with natural or what we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:25">0:55:25-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  might want to define as natural, organic and local foods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:29">0:55:29-0:55:32</a>:</strong>  And that's generally been how food co-ops have evolved.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:32">0:55:32-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  They've evolved in sort of that sector of the consumer economy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:46</a>:</strong>  But I think this is the next evolution in the cooperative model is seeing this resource<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:46">0:55:46-0:55:54</a>:</strong>  that's being created by the cooperative sector being accessible now to more and more people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:54">0:55:54-0:55:59</a>:</strong>  And so you have groups like the Food Co-op Initiative, which is a nonprofit that has<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:55:59">0:55:59-0:56:05</a>:</strong>  been supported by the entire co-op food co-op sector and larger cooperative sector, non-food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:05">0:56:05-0:56:11</a>:</strong>  co-op sector to help support startup food co-ops.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:11">0:56:11-0:56:14</a>:</strong>  And there's now a hundred startup food co-ops across the country.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:14">0:56:14-0:56:20</a>:</strong>  And of those, there's about a half dozen or so that are what might be defined as these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:20">0:56:20-0:56:26</a>:</strong>  food deserts, these areas without access to any grocery store whatsoever who are looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:26">0:56:26-0:56:29</a>:</strong>  to the cooperative model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:29">0:56:29-0:56:34</a>:</strong>  Like I say, I think we're still in that early stage of knowing whether or not this will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:34">0:56:34-0:56:38</a>:</strong>  become an answer to that challenge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:38">0:56:38-0:56:44</a>:</strong>  Well, and speaking of that, there are threats to this co-op model and things preventing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:44">0:56:44-0:56:47</a>:</strong>  it from taking hold faster.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:47">0:56:47-0:56:54</a>:</strong>  So what, in your opinion, can we as consumers do to help these cooperative grocery stores<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:54">0:56:54-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  to succeed besides, of course, just shopping there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:57:05</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, you know, I think one of the biggest challenges co-ops face right now, and it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:05">0:57:05-0:57:12</a>:</strong>  not just me who thinks this, this is sort of the question that everyone within the food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:12">0:57:12-0:57:19</a>:</strong>  co-op community is asking is, how does the co-op sector differentiate itself?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:19">0:57:19-0:57:28</a>:</strong>  Because like I said, so many co-ops are within this local and organic food niche, and no<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:28">0:57:28-0:57:34</a>:</strong>  longer is it really a niche in the sense that many of the chains...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:34">0:57:34-0:57:41</a>:</strong>  In fact, there's now at least a dozen natural food chains that have followed the Whole Foods<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:41">0:57:41-0:57:47</a>:</strong>  lead, if you will, and are now growing at a similar pace that Whole Foods has at one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:47">0:57:47-0:57:50</a>:</strong>  point had grown.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:50">0:57:50-0:57:57</a>:</strong>  It's no longer easy for the food co-ops that had once operated in this kind of niche market<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:57">0:57:57-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  to differentiate themselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:03</a>:</strong>  And so co-ops are asking themselves, well, how do we differentiate themselves?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:03">0:58:03-0:58:07</a>:</strong>  Or ourselves from the chain retailers?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:07">0:58:07-0:58:12</a>:</strong>  And there's so many ways in which they are different, many of which we've talked about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:12">0:58:12-0:58:14</a>:</strong>  here on your show.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:14">0:58:14-0:58:18</a>:</strong>  And yet being able to communicate that is the biggest challenge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:18">0:58:18-0:58:23</a>:</strong>  And so to answer your question, what can eaters and what can consumers do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:23">0:58:23-0:58:30</a>:</strong>  I think the biggest step that we can make as people who care about our local food systems,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:30">0:58:30-0:58:36</a>:</strong>  who care about our communities, is to, well, for one, like you say, shop at a co-op.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:36">0:58:36-0:58:41</a>:</strong>  But if you can't, and of course that's not the only thing we need to do, I think, we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:41">0:58:41-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  need to be able to inform ourselves about what differentiates co-ops from chains so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:58:52</a>:</strong>  that we can have those same conversations like we're having, so that those conversations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:52">0:58:52-0:58:56</a>:</strong>  can happen in the stores, they can happen around the dinner table, they can happen on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:58:56">0:58:56-0:59:04</a>:</strong>  the street, in our communities, they can happen in just the everyday conversation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:04">0:59:04-0:59:11</a>:</strong>  The impact that I found in just having short two, three, five minute conversations with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:11">0:59:11-0:59:20</a>:</strong>  people about food co-ops, there is a lot of power in those moments to be able to inform<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:20">0:59:20-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  of just some of the highlights, for example, from this conversation of what differentiates<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:25">0:59:25-0:59:31</a>:</strong>  a co-op from a chain, in my experience has been that in offering just those little tidbits,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:31">0:59:31-0:59:39</a>:</strong>  like the elevator speech, the elevator pitch, for example, that moment can be the difference<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:39">0:59:39-0:59:46</a>:</strong>  between somebody choosing to shop at a chain retailer or choosing to shop at a food co-op.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:46">0:59:46-0:59:51</a>:</strong>  So I think that's the biggest step to take, is to inform ourselves enough that we feel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:51">0:59:51-0:59:56</a>:</strong>  comfortable and confident to be able to share with one another why community owned grocery<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=0:59:56">0:59:56-1:00:03</a>:</strong>  store is such an important part of changing the food system, of supporting our communities,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:03">1:00:03-1:00:07</a>:</strong>  of ensuring that people who are producing food in our communities can keep doing it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:07">1:00:07-1:00:10</a>:</strong>  for many generations to come.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:10">1:00:10-1:00:13</a>:</strong>  I think that's one of the biggest steps we can take.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:13">1:00:13-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  Absolutely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:18</a>:</strong>  I mean, the education and awareness aspect of so many of the things that we talk about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:18">1:00:18-1:00:23</a>:</strong>  and not just with our consumption models, but like where our resources, our food sources<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:23">1:00:23-1:00:30</a>:</strong>  come from, how they're produced, what hands touch them until they get to our plates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:30">1:00:30-1:00:35</a>:</strong>  And every step in between, just figuring out how much of that we want to support and how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:35">1:00:35-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  much we would like to see shift is really important because these are not terribly transparent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:41</a>:</strong>  industries.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:41">1:00:41-1:00:43</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of complexity in them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:43">1:00:43-1:00:47</a>:</strong>  And that's one of the things that I found most valuable about the way that your book<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:47">1:00:47-1:00:50</a>:</strong>  was laid out is it made it approachable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:50">1:00:50-1:00:54</a>:</strong>  You could see the lineage, you could see some of the history about how we got where we are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:00:54">1:00:54-1:01:01</a>:</strong>  and how these alternative models have a real chance at affecting and transforming how we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:01">1:01:01-1:01:03</a>:</strong>  interact with our food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:03">1:01:03-1:01:08</a>:</strong>  Now I'm curious, before we start to wrap things up here, could you tell me a little bit about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:08">1:01:08-1:01:10</a>:</strong>  your own relationship with food?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:10">1:01:10-1:01:16</a>:</strong>  You said that you started to work in the hospitality sector and got more of an introduction into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:16">1:01:16-1:01:21</a>:</strong>  how things work through there, even before you started your own research.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:21">1:01:21-1:01:26</a>:</strong>  And I'm curious as to how you or sort of what were some of the most eye opening things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:26">1:01:26-1:01:31</a>:</strong>  you learned as you became more aware of how this works?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:31">1:01:31-1:01:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well, you know, I think as I, you know, as I introduce the book in this way, I share<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:39">1:01:39-1:01:45</a>:</strong>  my experience, particularly as a food systems journalist.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:45">1:01:45-1:01:51</a>:</strong>  And so, you know, I spent five years producing and hosting a radio show and podcast called<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:51">1:01:51-1:01:53</a>:</strong>  Deconstructing Dinner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:01:53">1:01:53-1:02:00</a>:</strong>  And I started doing that in 2006 and I began producing it here in Nelson, BC and it got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:00">1:02:00-1:02:05</a>:</strong>  syndicated on community stations all across Canada and quite a few in the US.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:05">1:02:05-1:02:06</a>:</strong>  And I did that for five years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:06">1:02:06-1:02:13</a>:</strong>  And you can imagine, as I'm sure, you know, especially in your case, as well as a host<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:13">1:02:13-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  of a podcast, every week that I would devote my time and energy into researching whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:25</a>:</strong>  the topic was on the show that week, every week, it would completely change my reality<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:25">1:02:25-1:02:30</a>:</strong>  and my relationship to not only food, but to the everything around me, to the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:30">1:02:30-1:02:38</a>:</strong>  No longer, you know, was I living in ignorance or in denial.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:38">1:02:38-1:02:45</a>:</strong>  You know, for example, the moment I learned of the factory farming methods for, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:45">1:02:45-1:02:51</a>:</strong>  hogs for pork, no longer could I touch that product.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:51">1:02:51-1:02:59</a>:</strong>  And so this was my life for five years where not only was I, you know, sharing this information<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:02:59">1:02:59-1:03:04</a>:</strong>  on my radio show and podcast, I was also like transforming my own relationship to food at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:04">1:03:04-1:03:06</a>:</strong>  the same time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:06">1:03:06-1:03:15</a>:</strong>  And so I naturally became involved in trying to source all of my food from everywhere but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:15">1:03:15-1:03:17</a>:</strong>  the grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:17">1:03:17-1:03:21</a>:</strong>  I spent all of my time invested in starting CSAs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:21">1:03:21-1:03:29</a>:</strong>  You know, I became involved in helping launch Canada's first grain CSA.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:29">1:03:29-1:03:34</a>:</strong>  I was part of a vegetable CSA where I was going out to the farm and helping out on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:34">1:03:34-1:03:35</a>:</strong>  farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:35">1:03:35-1:03:36</a>:</strong>  I was trying my own food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:36">1:03:36-1:03:38</a>:</strong>  I was canning my own food.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:38">1:03:38-1:03:44</a>:</strong>  I was running an illegal raw milk collective because in most of Canada, it's illegal to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:44">1:03:44-1:03:47</a>:</strong>  retail raw milk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:47">1:03:47-1:03:52</a>:</strong>  That's a wild thing that I wish we had more time to talk about that in itself is a topic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:52">1:03:52-1:03:56</a>:</strong>  to put a whole episode around.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:03:56">1:03:56-1:04:01</a>:</strong>  I was living a criminal lifestyle just to feed myself food that meant something to me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:01">1:04:01-1:04:04</a>:</strong>  and was valuable to me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:04">1:04:04-1:04:08</a>:</strong>  I was getting a talk about a strong indicator that our food system and legislation is broken<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:08">1:04:08-1:04:13</a>:</strong>  when you're doing that, just distributing whole milk.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:13">1:04:13-1:04:20</a>:</strong>  And milk, I was getting the illegal apple juice delivered to my front door because in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:20">1:04:20-1:04:28</a>:</strong>  this case, it was unpasteurized apple juice and it's not allowed to retail unpasteurized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:28">1:04:28-1:04:35</a>:</strong>  apple juice or at least at that point, it was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:35">1:04:35-1:04:43</a>:</strong>  A lot of it was illegal from unlicensed processors, people who were processing the meat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:43">1:04:43-1:04:46</a>:</strong>  This was my life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:46">1:04:46-1:04:55</a>:</strong>  I think what's important for the sake of the question about how did that life lead to where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:04:55">1:04:55-1:05:03</a>:</strong>  this is now for me was I got to this place of personally just being exhausted at trying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:03">1:05:03-1:05:07</a>:</strong>  to sustain that lifestyle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:07">1:05:07-1:05:08</a>:</strong>  It was really fun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:08">1:05:08-1:05:17</a>:</strong>  It was something that I would never have changed and in many ways, I still eat in similar ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:17">1:05:17-1:05:22</a>:</strong>  I still access a lot of food from other places that aren't my grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:22">1:05:22-1:05:27</a>:</strong>  But I got to this place where some of these initiatives that I was a part of and the example<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:27">1:05:27-1:05:30</a>:</strong>  I use in the book is the grain CSA.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:30">1:05:30-1:05:34</a>:</strong>  So this was a CSA that at one point had 450 members.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:34">1:05:34-1:05:42</a>:</strong>  This was only in its second year and we were sourcing upwards to about $75,000 worth of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:42">1:05:42-1:05:50</a>:</strong>  grain from a nearby valley not far from Nelson where we were supporting three farm families.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:05:50">1:05:50-1:06:01</a>:</strong>  We were getting access to oats, lentils, yellow peas, various varieties of wheat and spelt.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:01">1:06:01-1:06:05</a>:</strong>  We had 450 families.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:05">1:06:05-1:06:10</a>:</strong>  Then as the third year came and the fourth year came, the numbers started to decline<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:10">1:06:10-1:06:15</a>:</strong>  significantly and as I began to ask people about what is it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:15">1:06:15-1:06:20</a>:</strong>  Why is it you're not buying your grain again this year?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:20">1:06:20-1:06:22</a>:</strong>  The answers were pretty much unanimous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:22">1:06:22-1:06:29</a>:</strong>  Everybody was still sitting on that grain that they got in their first year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:29">1:06:29-1:06:34</a>:</strong>  So the excitement and interest and energy in the grain CSA which within two years led<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:34">1:06:34-1:06:38</a>:</strong>  to this 450 families signing on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:38">1:06:38-1:06:46</a>:</strong>  This was like $100 a family at the time, eventually $125 a share.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:46">1:06:46-1:06:52</a>:</strong>  People were investing a lot of money into this and yet when it came time to actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:06:52">1:06:52-1:07:02</a>:</strong>  translating that into action which required every member of the CSA to either mill their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:02">1:07:02-1:07:08</a>:</strong>  own grain to turn it into flour or to roll their own oats or to bring it once a week<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:08">1:07:08-1:07:15</a>:</strong>  to a local person who would be milling it for pennies, not much money at all in order<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:15">1:07:15-1:07:22</a>:</strong>  to do that, but those extra steps of actually taking it there or doing it yourself wasn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:22">1:07:22-1:07:27</a>:</strong>  something generally many members, certainly not all of them, but many members weren't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:27">1:07:27-1:07:30</a>:</strong>  willing to take on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:30">1:07:30-1:07:37</a>:</strong>  That really just woke me up because I thought this grain CSA, I thought this was the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:37">1:07:37-1:07:42</a>:</strong>  I thought this is what will transform our food system locally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:42">1:07:42-1:07:48</a>:</strong>  Everyone in our community is going to be eating locally grown grain within five, 10 years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:48">1:07:48-1:07:51</a>:</strong>  I thought.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:51">1:07:51-1:07:54</a>:</strong>  Sure enough, that wasn't the case.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:54">1:07:54-1:07:59</a>:</strong>  What this signaled to me was that as much interest and excitement as there is in these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:07:59">1:07:59-1:08:06</a>:</strong>  alternative models to accessing food, there's only ever, I shouldn't say ever, there only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:06">1:08:06-1:08:14</a>:</strong>  in the short term will be a small niche of people who are that devoted and committed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:14">1:08:14-1:08:18</a>:</strong>  I'm still one of those people in the sense that I'm still the coordinator of a flour<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:18">1:08:18-1:08:24</a>:</strong>  mill co-op where there's 25 of us who go own a flour mill and I still buy my grain from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:24">1:08:24-1:08:26</a>:</strong>  those farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:26">1:08:26-1:08:35</a>:</strong>  I do think that that is the future because it is in that way that farmers can receive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:35">1:08:35-1:08:39</a>:</strong>  most of the food dollar that they possibly can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:39">1:08:39-1:08:47</a>:</strong>  In many cases with wheat, as an example, a farmer is only getting 8 or 9 cents of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:47">1:08:47-1:08:48</a>:</strong>  food dollar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:48">1:08:48-1:08:51</a>:</strong>  That's not a lot of power in the marketplace.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:51">1:08:51-1:08:57</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of that dollar that's being taken from where we spend the money to what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:57">1:08:57-1:08:58</a>:</strong>  they receive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:08:58">1:08:58-1:09:01</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of other links in that chain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:01">1:09:01-1:09:06</a>:</strong>  Being able to give that money directly to that farmer, to me, is the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:06">1:09:06-1:09:13</a>:</strong>  But are we there yet is really the question that I came to in that journey for myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:13">1:09:13-1:09:21</a>:</strong>  We are there to a small degree, but in the 10 years that spanned 2006 to roughly around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:21">1:09:21-1:09:27</a>:</strong>  the time I started to work on this book, or at least conceive the book, in that 10 years,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:27">1:09:27-1:09:33</a>:</strong>  the percentage of our food dollars, and I say we as in North America, the percentage<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:33">1:09:33-1:09:39</a>:</strong>  of our food dollars that was going to these direct market approaches like farmers markets<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:39">1:09:39-1:09:42</a>:</strong>  and CSAs, it didn't change much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:42">1:09:42-1:09:45</a>:</strong>  Certainly we saw the explosion of interest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:45">1:09:45-1:09:54</a>:</strong>  No doubt there are more CSAs today than there were 10 years ago in a way that deserves a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:09:54">1:09:54-1:10:00</a>:</strong>  parade and celebration down the street, if not a national holiday to celebrate that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:00">1:10:00-1:10:08</a>:</strong>  But in the grand scheme of things, the percentage of our food dollars barely changed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:08">1:10:08-1:10:15</a>:</strong>  What we have now is, like I mentioned earlier, still 94% of consumer food dollars going towards<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:15">1:10:15-1:10:17</a>:</strong>  some form of food retailer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:17">1:10:17-1:10:22</a>:</strong>  It was there through my personal experience and through just my experience as an eater<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:22">1:10:22-1:10:31</a>:</strong>  and as a journalist where all of a sudden my interest turned to grocery stores, where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:31">1:10:31-1:10:37</a>:</strong>  the local food movement and the interest among all of us to support new and alternative forms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:37">1:10:37-1:10:43</a>:</strong>  of food delivery and food access and food production, it just all started to funnel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:43">1:10:43-1:10:45</a>:</strong>  into this one place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:45">1:10:45-1:10:52</a>:</strong>  This is where it seems like we need to be putting at least 94% of our energy is into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:52">1:10:52-1:10:57</a>:</strong>  our grocery stores that are operating in our community because this is where by and large<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:57">1:10:57-1:10:59</a>:</strong>  most people are spending their money.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:10:59">1:10:59-1:11:05</a>:</strong>  I think it's through transforming the grocery stores in our communities that we can make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:05">1:11:05-1:11:12</a>:</strong>  these alternative models of accessing food like farmers markets, like CSAs, like educating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:12">1:11:12-1:11:17</a>:</strong>  all of us and educating ourselves on how to grow food and keep those skills and knowledge<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:17">1:11:17-1:11:19</a>:</strong>  within our communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:19">1:11:19-1:11:25</a>:</strong>  All of those things will happen when we can support our grocery stores if they're food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:25">1:11:25-1:11:30</a>:</strong>  co-ops, if they're this model of grocery store that we know can sustain itself well into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:30">1:11:30-1:11:33</a>:</strong>  the future because it's owned by the community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:33">1:11:33-1:11:40</a>:</strong>  It's not owned by someone who at any given moment might sell to another owner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:40">1:11:40-1:11:45</a>:</strong>  We have these stories that have demonstrated and proven that they support CSAs, they support<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:45">1:11:45-1:11:49</a>:</strong>  farmers markets, they're supporting the same people who are sustaining those alternative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:49">1:11:49-1:11:52</a>:</strong>  models of food production.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:52">1:11:52-1:11:59</a>:</strong>  These are the food co-ops that are the grocery stores that I think will enable these alternative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:11:59">1:11:59-1:12:04</a>:</strong>  models and this alternative food system and this food system that is the one that I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:04">1:12:04-1:12:07</a>:</strong>  is the one that will be the most sustainable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:07">1:12:07-1:12:12</a>:</strong>  It's going to be sustained by this model of grocery store.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:12">1:12:12-1:12:16</a>:</strong>  Well I got to say you make a very good and compelling argument through your book and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:16">1:12:16-1:12:20</a>:</strong>  to give people a little bit of context, I consider myself pretty well informed in general<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:20">1:12:20-1:12:21</a>:</strong>  on the food system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:21">1:12:21-1:12:26</a>:</strong>  I've worked in industrial farming, organic farming, permaculture farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:26">1:12:26-1:12:32</a>:</strong>  I even used to work as an engineer on ships maintaining the refrigerated cargo that brought<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:32">1:12:32-1:12:36</a>:</strong>  fresh food from one side of the globe to the other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:36">1:12:36-1:12:46</a>:</strong>  I have worked as a chef, a baker, I have helped to manage farmers market stalls and like a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:46">1:12:46-1:12:50</a>:</strong>  lot of other pieces in between and I got to say this was like the biggest gap in my knowledge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:50">1:12:50-1:12:57</a>:</strong>  I didn't really understand though I have supported local co-op grocery stores in the past.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:12:57">1:12:57-1:13:02</a>:</strong>  In fact two of the ones that you've mentioned, the co-op network around Seattle I used to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:02">1:13:02-1:13:07</a>:</strong>  interact with quite a bit when I lived there and the Seward co-op in Minnesota close to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:07">1:13:07-1:13:11</a>:</strong>  where my brothers live I've frequented as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:11">1:13:11-1:13:17</a>:</strong>  I honestly really didn't understand how big of an impact on the food system these large<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:17">1:13:17-1:13:24</a>:</strong>  grocery chains were and how viable of an alternative this co-op model was though I had like a minor<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:24">1:13:24-1:13:25</a>:</strong>  insight into it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:25">1:13:25-1:13:31</a>:</strong>  So before I let you go here could you share with our audience the ways that they can best<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:31">1:13:31-1:13:36</a>:</strong>  get in touch with you where they can buy the book and how they can find out more about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:36">1:13:36-1:13:37</a>:</strong>  this topic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:37">1:13:37-1:13:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah well so the website for the book is grocerystory.coop as in co-op so.coop and I'm going to be on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:49">1:13:49-1:13:58</a>:</strong>  a book tour for most of 2019 so I've got about 130 locations that I'm going to be over the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:13:58">1:13:58-1:14:05</a>:</strong>  next well for the remainder of 2019 and I would love to meet you know your listeners<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:05">1:14:05-1:14:10</a>:</strong>  if there if if any of them are in the communities that I'll be visiting so that tour schedule<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:10">1:14:10-1:14:12</a>:</strong>  is on the website.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:12">1:14:12-1:14:17</a>:</strong>  The book is coming out I mean the publication date is May 7th but it'll probably start hitting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:17">1:14:17-1:14:22</a>:</strong>  the shelves by late April and hopefully your local bookstores will have it you know like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:22">1:14:22-1:14:28</a>:</strong>  I think that to me is the most important thing is if you can support your local bookstore<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:28">1:14:28-1:14:35</a>:</strong>  or find the book at one of your local food co-ops that would be my recommendation otherwise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:35">1:14:35-1:14:41</a>:</strong>  you know it's available everywhere else you can find books it's on Amazon it's on you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:41">1:14:41-1:14:47</a>:</strong>  know every online retailer that sells books or you can order it directly from my publisher<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-jon-steinman/#t=1:14:47">1:14:47-1:14:51</a>:</strong>  which is New Society Publishers which I know your listeners are probably familiar with<br />
