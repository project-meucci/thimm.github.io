<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:04">0:02:04-0:02:09</a>:</strong>  Welcome back everyone to this ongoing series on regenerative agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:09">0:02:09-0:02:12</a>:</strong>  Last week we kicked off with an interview with Joel Salatin, and in this session I've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:17</a>:</strong>  got another great interview with one of the most influential Regen Ag practitioners in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:17">0:02:17-0:02:18</a>:</strong>  Europe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:18">0:02:18-0:02:22</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of inspiring voices in the regenerative agriculture community, but few<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:22">0:02:22-0:02:28</a>:</strong>  have done such a thorough job of documenting and publishing every step of the development<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:28">0:02:28-0:02:34</a>:</strong>  of a small profitable farm the way Richard Perkins has done with Rydgdale Permaculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:34">0:02:34-0:02:37</a>:</strong>  Especially now that I've decided to put down roots in Europe, I've been looking for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:37">0:02:37-0:02:42</a>:</strong>  examples of profitable small farming models for inspiration for my own project here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:42">0:02:42-0:02:47</a>:</strong>  And between Richard's YouTube channel and two books, Making Small Farms Work, and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:47">0:02:47-0:02:51</a>:</strong>  new volume titled Regenerative Agriculture, there are few better resources to guide you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:51">0:02:51-0:02:58</a>:</strong>  step by step through all the design considerations from landscape analysis, business planning,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:02:58">0:02:58-0:03:01</a>:</strong>  crunching numbers, and creative paths to market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:01">0:03:01-0:03:06</a>:</strong>  Though I spoke to Richard for the first time back in season 1, I invited him back for this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:06">0:03:06-0:03:10</a>:</strong>  episode to talk about some of the massive changes that are coming about from the COVID<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:10">0:03:10-0:03:15</a>:</strong>  health crisis, and how he's seen it affect small farms around Europe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:15">0:03:15-0:03:20</a>:</strong>  We explore topics like farm enterprise analysis, suggestions for direct to consumer marketing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:20">0:03:20-0:03:26</a>:</strong>  and collaboration, and Richard also talks about his observations over the years of transformation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:26">0:03:26-0:03:31</a>:</strong>  of his small farm in northern Sweden, not only from a land health perspective, but also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:31">0:03:31-0:03:36</a>:</strong>  things that he's noticed about his teaching and mentorship strategy, as well as the characteristics<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:36">0:03:36-0:03:39</a>:</strong>  he thinks are essential for succeeding in farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:39">0:03:39-0:03:44</a>:</strong>  This interview became a lot more philosophical than our first session, and for those of you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:44">0:03:44-0:03:48</a>:</strong>  who are hoping to hear Richard's backstory and description of his farm and business strategy,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:48">0:03:48-0:03:52</a>:</strong>  I've linked to our first interview in the show notes on the website, or you can find<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:04:00</a>:</strong>  Now I also want to say a sincere thank you to all of you wonderful listeners who have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:00">0:04:00-0:04:05</a>:</strong>  reached out to check up on me during this difficult time of lockdowns and social distancing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:05">0:04:05-0:04:09</a>:</strong>  I'm very grateful and fortunate to say that my partner and I are healthy and safe, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:09">0:04:09-0:04:13</a>:</strong>  that we're finally able to get out of the house a bit as Spain has begun to ease restrictions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:13">0:04:13-0:04:18</a>:</strong>  on the lockdown in a gradual transition back to a new normal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:18">0:04:18-0:04:22</a>:</strong>  I hope this message finds all of you listening out there healthy and safe as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:22">0:04:22-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  And now I'll hand things over to Richard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:27</a>:</strong>  Hey, welcome back, Richard.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:27">0:04:27-0:04:28</a>:</strong>  It's such a pleasure to be talking with you again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:28">0:04:28-0:04:29</a>:</strong>  How are you doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:29">0:04:29-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  Great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:30">0:04:30-0:04:31</a>:</strong>  Thanks, Oliver.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:31">0:04:31-0:04:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it's good to be back on here and spend some time talking with you, Sanja.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:35">0:04:35-0:04:39</a>:</strong>  Well, yeah, well, this is wild times that we're living in right now with the coronavirus<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:39">0:04:39-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  lockdown and just the way that it's affecting the whole globe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:46</a>:</strong>  It's a unique opportunity to explore some new topics here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:46">0:04:46-0:04:49</a>:</strong>  And tell me a little bit about how things are going at the farm with these new developments<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:49">0:04:49-0:04:50</a>:</strong>  for you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:50">0:04:50-0:04:56</a>:</strong>  Well, it's, we're actually in the process of still really taking it in because this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:04:56">0:04:56-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  is the time when our, like the first of April is actually when our team typically arrive.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:02">0:05:02-0:05:08</a>:</strong>  We've actually got three of the team here now, and there's another girl coming in a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:08">0:05:08-0:05:09</a>:</strong>  couple of weeks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:09">0:05:09-0:05:14</a>:</strong>  If the travel bans on, you know, on progressing any further.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:14">0:05:14-0:05:17</a>:</strong>  But we've been going through all kinds of processes to be honest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:17">0:05:17-0:05:24</a>:</strong>  First of all, a couple of weeks ago, we were all really sick and it was quite a long sickness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:24">0:05:24-0:05:28</a>:</strong>  And I, you know, in the current state of things, we were questioning what we had.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:28">0:05:28-0:05:37</a>:</strong>  My partner had the stereotypical symptoms and I had more just like really bad flu symptoms,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:37">0:05:37-0:05:39</a>:</strong>  that we started sort of second guessing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:39">0:05:39-0:05:46</a>:</strong>  But here in Sweden, it's the government has both been criticized and praised for its approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:46">0:05:46-0:05:53</a>:</strong>  And I think more in the world stage, more critical response actually, because business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:53">0:05:53-0:05:55</a>:</strong>  is open as normal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:05:55">0:05:55-0:06:00</a>:</strong>  Now I do get the sense people are sort of keeping their distance from each other, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:00">0:06:00-0:06:05</a>:</strong>  Sweden's not exactly a touchy feely place anyway.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:05">0:06:05-0:06:11</a>:</strong>  But I did get the sense when I've been to town, like people are spending, you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:11">0:06:11-0:06:16</a>:</strong>  they're staying away from each other more so than normal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:16">0:06:16-0:06:22</a>:</strong>  And so we've been going through a process of what's the best approach for us to take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:22">0:06:22-0:06:28</a>:</strong>  because we're not fully trusting the government's response, which is, you know, basically we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:28">0:06:28-0:06:35</a>:</strong>  trust our citizens to be healthy and do what's needed to avoid the spread, which would seem<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:35">0:06:35-0:06:41</a>:</strong>  quite lackadaisical in relation to most other countries in the world.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:47</a>:</strong>  But the death toll and infection rate is very low here, but they haven't been testing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:47">0:06:47-0:06:53</a>:</strong>  So it's, you know, it wouldn't be any surprise if the infection rate is much higher.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:53">0:06:53-0:06:58</a>:</strong>  So we've been going through a big process of deciding whether to keep us at home from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:06:58">0:06:58-0:07:05</a>:</strong>  daycare because we basically analyzed the situation when the first crew member arrived.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:05">0:07:05-0:07:09</a>:</strong>  And bearing in mind for listeners further afield, like Europe's in, like each country<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:09">0:07:09-0:07:18</a>:</strong>  is taking its own course and it's still possible to travel within certain countries in Europe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:18">0:07:18-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  and for certain countries it's not possible at this time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:22">0:07:22-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  So we've had to, yeah, so we've had to select, it led us to take a last minute decision in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:32</a>:</strong>  the choice of team.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:32">0:07:32-0:07:35</a>:</strong>  And that's really been down to Johanna this year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:35">0:07:35-0:07:40</a>:</strong>  I would normally be very much involved in that process, but I was meant to be away this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:40">0:07:40-0:07:45</a>:</strong>  summer, so I felt it was much more important for Johanna to go through that selection process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:45">0:07:45-0:07:53</a>:</strong>  But a big part of that was choosing people from places that would be useful to get here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:53">0:07:53-0:07:58</a>:</strong>  So we basically closed down all applications for people outside of Europe because it just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:07:58">0:07:58-0:08:05</a>:</strong>  felt too risky for someone to come from Australia or Brazil and be stuck here for an indefinite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:05">0:08:05-0:08:06</a>:</strong>  amount of time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:06">0:08:06-0:08:07</a>:</strong>  Of course, yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:07">0:08:07-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  So that affected us already, but then, you know, I follow the UK news a lot being from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:22</a>:</strong>  there and just seeing what's going on globally, we decided, okay, so the biggest risk factor<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:22">0:08:22-0:08:27</a>:</strong>  we have is actually our son going to daycare and potentially bringing something back because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:27">0:08:27-0:08:32</a>:</strong>  we're in a unique position where we can totally self isolate ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:32">0:08:32-0:08:40</a>:</strong>  We have a whole human diet on the farm and once the team's here, we're living quite in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:40">0:08:40-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  a bubble with farming every day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:48</a>:</strong>  So the only, the weakest point for us in the coronavirus context would be our son going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:48">0:08:48-0:08:51</a>:</strong>  to daycare and then the way we sell.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:51">0:08:51-0:08:57</a>:</strong>  But I can talk a bit more about that because we've already put measures in place anticipating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:57">0:08:57-0:08:58</a>:</strong>  things getting worse.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:08:58">0:08:58-0:09:02</a>:</strong>  Well, let's get to the marketing part of the minute.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:02">0:09:02-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:07</a>:</strong>  I want to hear a little bit about, you know, with the regenerative agricultural model that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:07">0:09:07-0:09:12</a>:</strong>  you've promoted and that you've really exemplified on your farm, let's talk a little bit about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:12">0:09:12-0:09:18</a>:</strong>  the resiliency of the kind of diverse business model that you've pioneered and how regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:18">0:09:18-0:09:24</a>:</strong>  agriculture strategies help to build resilience on the business side as well as through enhanced<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:30</a>:</strong>  ecosystem services as this is a really important time to be looking at that through all business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:30">0:09:30-0:09:31</a>:</strong>  lenses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:31">0:09:31-0:09:38</a>:</strong>  Yeah, well just going back one step first, I think like the biggest decision that impacts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:38">0:09:38-0:09:44</a>:</strong>  our daily life is the decision to keep our son at home and he's only three.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:44">0:09:44-0:09:51</a>:</strong>  So it takes like right now, Johanna and I are working two hour shifts alternately and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:51">0:09:51-0:09:58</a>:</strong>  it's no big deal and obviously a lot more people are in a lot more pressing situations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:09:58">0:09:58-0:10:04</a>:</strong>  but it has quite a massive impact on the running of the farm because this is the time of year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:04">0:10:04-0:10:09</a>:</strong>  when the most activity is going on to start up the season and we're typically running<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:09">0:10:09-0:10:14</a>:</strong>  flat out and training people that haven't been on the farm before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:14">0:10:14-0:10:21</a>:</strong>  So it's an interesting thing and it plays into that question of resiliency because we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:21">0:10:21-0:10:27</a>:</strong>  pretty stretched at this time of year that it's definitely affecting our time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:27">0:10:27-0:10:34</a>:</strong>  So we've changed our daily schedule so that we sleep very early and wake up even earlier<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:34">0:10:34-0:10:39</a>:</strong>  than we typically do to be able to deal with admin and things like that that we would typically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:39">0:10:39-0:10:45</a>:</strong>  have a little time in the morning before we get into the work day outside when our son<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:45">0:10:45-0:10:47</a>:</strong>  will be at daycare.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:47">0:10:47-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  So it's obviously going to impact a lot of people with their kids at home and we only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:57</a>:</strong>  have one child so I imagine people with larger families that are also trying to run the farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:10:57">0:10:57-0:11:04</a>:</strong>  are going to find that challenging just to fit in things around the day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:04">0:11:04-0:11:10</a>:</strong>  And it's also a blessing in disguise in that there's nothing more wonderful than having<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:10">0:11:10-0:11:16</a>:</strong>  this son on the farm and including him in the processes but it really does impact time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:16">0:11:16-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  which is a big thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:26</a>:</strong>  But then more addressing your question directly I think, well there's many angles we can look<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:26">0:11:26-0:11:34</a>:</strong>  at that from but it's definitely helpful, it's hard at this point to predict how things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:34">0:11:34-0:11:37</a>:</strong>  will go throughout the summer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:37">0:11:37-0:11:43</a>:</strong>  But one of the immediate benefits I see in a diverse product portfolio is that we have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:43">0:11:43-0:11:47</a>:</strong>  a lot of products that can be stored.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:47">0:11:47-0:11:53</a>:</strong>  So frozen meats that we can put a year on their best before that gives you a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:53">0:11:53-0:11:55</a>:</strong>  flexibility.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:11:55">0:11:55-0:12:01</a>:</strong>  And like right now it seems like there's an increased demand for local food but it's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:01">0:12:01-0:12:06</a>:</strong>  clear to me or obvious to me how it will go selling fresh produce.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:06">0:12:06-0:12:12</a>:</strong>  You know there could be draconian regulations coming down the line that will impact market<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:12">0:12:12-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  gardeners for example in ways that are unprecedented.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:15">0:12:15-0:12:17</a>:</strong>  We just don't know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:17">0:12:17-0:12:21</a>:</strong>  So having storable products definitely feels useful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:21">0:12:21-0:12:30</a>:</strong>  But also I think there's something about a diverse product portfolio that means, like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:30">0:12:30-0:12:36</a>:</strong>  something we've always seen at the farm is having eggs helps you sell vegetables.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:36">0:12:36-0:12:42</a>:</strong>  And having chickens helps you sell eggs and you know having complementary products and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:42">0:12:42-0:12:47</a>:</strong>  having a broad portfolio brings you customers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:47">0:12:47-0:12:53</a>:</strong>  Like at the Rico rings that we sell at we're always consistently by far the busiest and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:53">0:12:53-0:12:57</a>:</strong>  I would say it's because we have a whole range of products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:12:57">0:12:57-0:13:04</a>:</strong>  Most people are selling just vegetables or just lamb or whatever but we're selling all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:04">0:13:04-0:13:11</a>:</strong>  different types of meats and eggs and vegetables and it's very convenient for someone to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:11">0:13:11-0:13:15</a>:</strong>  able to pick up a whole bunch of their shopping in one go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:15">0:13:15-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  Now Rico as a whole is a very convenient model because you have a baker, a dairy person,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:26</a>:</strong>  meat producers, egg producers, veg producers so it's convenient to a customer that can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:26">0:13:26-0:13:31</a>:</strong>  pick up you know a large proportion of their food there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:31">0:13:31-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  But we see the knock on effect of that through our farm sales in particular.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:41</a>:</strong>  So I think there's something generally to be said for having a diverse product portfolio<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:41">0:13:41-0:13:46</a>:</strong>  and in that adage that I think we even talked about last time I was on here, that saying<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:46">0:13:46-0:13:51</a>:</strong>  Joel Salatin says if it's much easier to find a hundred customers that will spend a thousand<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:51">0:13:51-0:13:55</a>:</strong>  euros with you than finding a thousand that will spend a hundred euros with you.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:55">0:13:55-0:13:56</a>:</strong>  And that's very very true.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:56">0:13:56-0:13:58</a>:</strong>  It's a good gem of wisdom yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:13:58">0:13:58-0:14:02</a>:</strong>  It applies to so many things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:02">0:14:02-0:14:09</a>:</strong>  It's very true in our experience so I think that's a good strategy at all times but certainly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:09">0:14:09-0:14:17</a>:</strong>  it's something to consider even for people only producing single items or like single<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:17">0:14:17-0:14:18</a>:</strong>  types of products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:18">0:14:18-0:14:25</a>:</strong>  This is a great time to consider online sales, delivery service and collaborations with other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:25">0:14:25-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  farmers to be able to supply you know one's weekly shopping in one drop to minimize contact<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:35</a>:</strong>  time etc.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:35">0:14:35-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  So even if people are farming one particular product there's still a way to get the benefit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:40">0:14:40-0:14:45</a>:</strong>  of that diversity by collaborating and I think we're going to see a lot more of that happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:45">0:14:45-0:14:51</a>:</strong>  And that's beneficial on so many other levels because of efficiency and you know imagine<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:51">0:14:51-0:14:56</a>:</strong>  you are collaborating with four different types of producers and you are running the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:56">0:14:56-0:14:59</a>:</strong>  Ricoh rings like we run you would only have to go once a month.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:14:59">0:14:59-0:15:02</a>:</strong>  I mean it would be perfect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:02">0:15:02-0:15:07</a>:</strong>  Yeah no I mean this turns out to be quite an ideal circumstance given the restrictions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:07">0:15:07-0:15:11</a>:</strong>  that are being implemented in a lot of places and even when there aren't restrictions in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:11">0:15:11-0:15:16</a>:</strong>  place just people's tendency to want to avoid the situation different marketing models like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:16">0:15:16-0:15:21</a>:</strong>  the Ricoh rings and I've heard other people adapting their sales strategy perhaps if they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:21">0:15:21-0:15:27</a>:</strong>  were selling mostly directly to restaurants which in many cases have shut down starting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:27">0:15:27-0:15:32</a>:</strong>  to offer delivery services or drive-through pickups from their locations and have you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:32">0:15:32-0:15:38</a>:</strong>  started to consider any other marketing strategies in the face of these big changes or are you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:38">0:15:38-0:15:45</a>:</strong>  still kind of doubling down on this one that seems to be very well adapted to the situation?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:45">0:15:45-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  Well there's two angles on that and well firstly quite early on I noticed my friend Mikkel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  who's running eggs and micro dairy over in Denmark and I know that nearly all his sales<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:07</a>:</strong>  are wholesale to restaurants in Copenhagen so I immediately felt concerned for him when<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:07">0:16:07-0:16:12</a>:</strong>  they were shutting down over there because I knew that that would be very challenging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:12">0:16:12-0:16:19</a>:</strong>  times and I think he had I don't know 50,000 eggs backing up and he just didn't know what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:19">0:16:19-0:16:28</a>:</strong>  to do but they very quickly switched the selling strategy to private people and like a drive-through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:28">0:16:28-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  a farm drive-through where there's no contact at all pre-sold and people pick it up and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:38</a>:</strong>  they don't even have any face-to-face contact and it appears to be going extremely well<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:38">0:16:38-0:16:45</a>:</strong>  I think a lot of people I've seen across in America a lot of people are seeing huge increases<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:45">0:16:45-0:16:52</a>:</strong>  in sales and it's really there's going to be some knock-on effects long term from that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:52">0:16:52-0:16:58</a>:</strong>  which is great but we haven't actually had to do that we do sell to restaurants but it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:16:58">0:16:58-0:17:07</a>:</strong>  makes up 20 to 30 percent of our revenue overall but we also have a waiting list for things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:07">0:17:07-0:17:13</a>:</strong>  like our egg subscriptions are always you know we sell eggs for three months at a time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:13">0:17:13-0:17:19</a>:</strong>  and there's always a waiting list for them and we completely sold out of our like we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:19">0:17:19-0:17:24</a>:</strong>  keep some of our pastured boilers in the freezer just to spread over the winter because we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:24">0:17:24-0:17:31</a>:</strong>  still selling eggs all through the winter and we sold out in November I think so we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:31">0:17:31-0:17:41</a>:</strong>  in a rush to produce more and so we haven't changed our tactic so going on from that in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:41">0:17:41-0:17:48</a>:</strong>  Sweden right now there's people are going to work and businesses are open even if people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:48">0:17:48-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  are you know keeping themselves to themselves a bit more but right now the government advice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:17:54">0:17:54-0:18:01</a>:</strong>  is like restricting gatherings of more than 50 people and so what we've done specifically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:01">0:18:01-0:18:07</a>:</strong>  for the Rico ring and a Rico ring if people aren't aware what that is is basically a pre-sold<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:07">0:18:07-0:18:12</a>:</strong>  online farmers market running through Facebook and you need to go look it up if you want<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:12">0:18:12-0:18:19</a>:</strong>  to know more about it because it's a very sweet setup it's the most efficient sales<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:19">0:18:19-0:18:25</a>:</strong>  model I've come across going on and we've been really championing that here and a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:25">0:18:25-0:18:30</a>:</strong>  of our students and followers have been taking that off to other parts of the world which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:30">0:18:30-0:18:37</a>:</strong>  is fantastic now that would typically be a group of 10 to 20 producers say turning up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:37">0:18:37-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  in their vehicles and they've already pre-sold whatever it is that they have vegetables eggs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:50</a>:</strong>  meat dairy whatever and so people are turning up and picking up their goods that they've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:50">0:18:50-0:18:56</a>:</strong>  already paid for and so it's a gathering and a lot of people pass through in a short time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:18:56">0:18:56-0:19:00</a>:</strong>  in the summer we run those for an hour in the winter for half an hour and we'll see<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:00">0:19:00-0:19:08</a>:</strong>  you know 150 customers come through and they're just basically not taking very long at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:08">0:19:08-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  stand they're just picking up their goods saying hello and off they go and so immediately<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:22</a>:</strong>  what we've done is set up some guidelines for making sure that we spread out the distance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:22">0:19:22-0:19:29</a>:</strong>  between people and the timing of them coming through and we're sort of looking ahead to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:29">0:19:29-0:19:35</a>:</strong>  see well look you know some countries are limited to gatherings of no more than two<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:35">0:19:35-0:19:42</a>:</strong>  so it's if we get this thing forward the way it's going in most places then we need to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:42">0:19:42-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  already start having systems in place for when it's not possible to run it like normal<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:53</a>:</strong>  so already johanna's just actually gone there today to to the bigger rico that we participate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:53">0:19:53-0:19:58</a>:</strong>  in and she's gone as a volunteer to help start this system so she's been very much at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:19:58">0:19:58-0:20:04</a>:</strong>  heart of setting up the rico rings that we're part of and is an admin for them so she's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:04">0:20:04-0:20:10</a>:</strong>  gone to sort of get everything in line i think she's been the most proactive person about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:10">0:20:10-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  this i think the general attitude in sweden is quite relaxed compared to most places so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:24</a>:</strong>  the way we've come up with for now is um we've organized the parking so that people don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:24">0:20:24-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  all come at once and stand in the queue it's like five people come in at a time into the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:29">0:20:29-0:20:34</a>:</strong>  space and there's a couple of traffic cones and one of the admins is letting people out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:34">0:20:34-0:20:41</a>:</strong>  and so it's one in one out and we've told people you know something like based on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:41">0:20:41-0:20:46</a>:</strong>  alphabetical order of their names if we've got and so we've made the slot a bit longer<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:46">0:20:46-0:20:50</a>:</strong>  so right now it would normally be half an hour to pick up all the produce for all the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:50">0:20:50-0:20:58</a>:</strong>  people from all the producers so we've extended that to an hour the summer timing and people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:20:58">0:20:58-0:21:03</a>:</strong>  should aim to come in these five minute windows now obviously it won't work like clockwork<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:03">0:21:03-0:21:11</a>:</strong>  but people are pretty respectful of that so it means people will be coming in in a concert<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:11">0:21:11-0:21:17</a>:</strong>  constant flow of less people and then we're using the tables and stands as a way to distance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:17">0:21:17-0:21:22</a>:</strong>  ourselves now some producers just open the boot of their car and just stand there and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:22">0:21:22-0:21:28</a>:</strong>  you know shake hands and whatever so we've always had a stand and treated it a bit like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:28">0:21:28-0:21:33</a>:</strong>  a market so we've told people like you need to you know bring a table and separate yourself<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:33">0:21:33-0:21:38</a>:</strong>  and we've informed all the rico customers which is nice because it's all on facebook<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:38">0:21:38-0:21:43</a>:</strong>  you have a ring for the customers and then you have a producer's page a separate page<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:43">0:21:43-0:21:49</a>:</strong>  for producers where we can discuss these sort of things but we've made all the customers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:49">0:21:49-0:21:54</a>:</strong>  aware ahead of time that hey it's not a time for chit chat right now it's like please come<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:21:54">0:21:54-0:22:01</a>:</strong>  in the time slot within your hours best you can and just pick up your stuff and it seems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:01">0:22:01-0:22:08</a>:</strong>  i think it's going really well like that and so the only thing that's really led us to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:08">0:22:08-0:22:18</a>:</strong>  consider in terms of changing our strategy is offering less options with our veg and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:18">0:22:18-0:22:25</a>:</strong>  the way we've done veg is we went from veg boxes to as rico came along we started selling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:25">0:22:25-0:22:33</a>:</strong>  bunches which were basically planned around veg boxes but offered people more choice at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:39</a>:</strong>  a premium so they were they were willing to pay more money for the same thing because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:39">0:22:39-0:22:45</a>:</strong>  they had a choice over certain items and they had a choice not to have it certain weeks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:45">0:22:45-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  and that's always been important in sweden because people go away in the summer and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:22:56</a>:</strong>  find it extremely difficult to coordinate with someone else to pick up the veg boxes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:22:56">0:22:56-0:23:02</a>:</strong>  like people aren't so social as in other countries in europe and it it's it strikes me as very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:02">0:23:02-0:23:08</a>:</strong>  bizarre but it's an issue for people and often people take quite long holidays here so so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:08">0:23:08-0:23:14</a>:</strong>  what we've considered doing now is reining back in on the choice and just offer one type<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:14">0:23:14-0:23:21</a>:</strong>  of share basically again possibly two but we want to minimize handling and minimize<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:21">0:23:21-0:23:27</a>:</strong>  like something we've always done like we've done tailored orders because people are willing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:27">0:23:27-0:23:32</a>:</strong>  to pay a premium we're more willing to tailor their orders but i think we've considered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:32">0:23:32-0:23:39</a>:</strong>  already to get rid of that and just offer the simplest minimal handling way to do everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:39">0:23:39-0:23:44</a>:</strong>  which benefits us and it will benefit the customer too yeah but other than that to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:44">0:23:44-0:23:48</a>:</strong>  a bit of an inconvenience i would imagine there'd be a good reception because they can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:48">0:23:48-0:23:54</a>:</strong>  see that it's in their best interest from a sanitary perspective yes definitely and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:23:54">0:23:54-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  i think obviously this situation is making own is only increasing the number of people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:11</a>:</strong>  who will identify the limitations of our typical food supply yeah and something really interesting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:11">0:24:11-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  that's going on is a lot of big conventional farms are are going to collapse this year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:19">0:24:19-0:24:27</a>:</strong>  because farm workers from poland lithuania aren't coming yeah and that's really interesting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:34</a>:</strong>  to me now i'm i'm someone that's sometimes uh got a finger pointed at me because i've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:34">0:24:34-0:24:41</a>:</strong>  got people coming here for training who are getting a training they can't get it pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:41">0:24:41-0:24:48</a>:</strong>  much any farm i can think of in europe and you know that all that free labor thing which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:48">0:24:48-0:24:55</a>:</strong>  is is so out of context anyway as i've explained in so many videos i try and share you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:24:55">0:24:55-0:25:00</a>:</strong>  my thoughts about this thing but what's really interesting is that most people don't know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:00">0:25:00-0:25:08</a>:</strong>  how most of the conventional and organic conventional vegetables in europe are grown and the mass<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:08">0:25:08-0:25:16</a>:</strong>  influx of highly underpaid eastern europeans that run the show or and the case around here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:16">0:25:16-0:25:22</a>:</strong>  in spain people from north africa and migrant workers from morocco and yeah yeah of course<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:22">0:25:22-0:25:30</a>:</strong>  yeah yeah but that's gonna be yeah that's gonna change business models and and maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:35</a>:</strong>  that's for the best but i imagine it'll be a bit rocky in between yeah yeah well almost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:35">0:25:35-0:25:40</a>:</strong>  feel good at least to be in an industry that is going to be considered essential as long<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:40">0:25:40-0:25:44</a>:</strong>  as there are humans and there's at least a certain amount of job security and that not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:44">0:25:44-0:25:53</a>:</strong>  that you were worried about that to begin with yeah i hope so i mean that holistic plan<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:53">0:25:53-0:25:59</a>:</strong>  where i mean even if you weren't doing any business in some bizarre scenario you've got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:25:59">0:25:59-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  all of your bases covered as far as the needs of your your family and and then some yeah<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:13</a>:</strong>  i mean there's definitely like i've always described this farm as a homestead that runs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:13">0:26:13-0:26:20</a>:</strong>  enterprises for profit and it wouldn't interest me to do any single enterprise on its own<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:20">0:26:20-0:26:28</a>:</strong>  i wouldn't find that interesting or stimulating like we're we're farming to produce epic food<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:28">0:26:28-0:26:34</a>:</strong>  and we it's partly because we want to eat epic food so there's there's a lot of there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:34">0:26:34-0:26:41</a>:</strong>  a lot to be said for the resilience of diverse farming and it's it's great to always see<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:41">0:26:41-0:26:48</a>:</strong>  the amount of new people coming into farming but i'm yeah i'm often a little bit bemused<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:48">0:26:48-0:26:53</a>:</strong>  how there are so few diverse farms most people are picking up one enterprise and of course<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:26:53">0:26:53-0:27:00</a>:</strong>  you've got to start somewhere but i suspect some a lot of people aren't exposed to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:00">0:27:00-0:27:09</a>:</strong>  true benefit of having diversified farms and i mean that from from a human health perspective<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:09">0:27:09-0:27:21</a>:</strong>  from an economic perspective from an ecosystem perspective too and and i think that's it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:21">0:27:21-0:27:29</a>:</strong>  yeah it's hard to know what supply chains are gonna fall out in the in the prospect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:29">0:27:29-0:27:35</a>:</strong>  of an extended crisis but it's you know it's always good not to have all your eggs in one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:35">0:27:35-0:27:44</a>:</strong>  basket as it were and i i think a lot of i i think the repercussions of this if it goes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:44">0:27:44-0:27:49</a>:</strong>  on longer the the biggest repercussions are going to be the long-term economic consequences<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:49">0:27:49-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  no and they're gonna they're gonna be far more drastic than the virus could ever be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:28:02</a>:</strong>  yeah and that's really gonna shake up the yeah yeah but that's really gonna change the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:02">0:28:02-0:28:08</a>:</strong>  way supply lines work and and it will affect people doing what we're doing also in ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:08">0:28:08-0:28:15</a>:</strong>  that we can't foresee so any degree of resiliency you can build in is is gonna help with that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:15">0:28:15-0:28:21</a>:</strong>  but it's i think it's too early to really say i i see a lot of stuff online right now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:21">0:28:21-0:28:26</a>:</strong>  people jumping into there's a crisis let's find the opportunities here and yeah we have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:26">0:28:26-0:28:32</a>:</strong>  to do that but i think it's it's also very premature in some ways because a lot's gonna<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:32">0:28:32-0:28:39</a>:</strong>  transpire that we we probably haven't even anticipated yet yeah it's it's inevitable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:39">0:28:39-0:28:45</a>:</strong>  i mean nothing like this has happened within our generation and i mean the context is even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:45">0:28:45-0:28:50</a>:</strong>  different from similar epidemics in the past uh given the way that we're all interconnected<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:50">0:28:50-0:28:56</a>:</strong>  the global community is entirely interdependent at the moment and so making predictions from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:28:56">0:28:56-0:29:03</a>:</strong>  this vantage point is always going to come with limitations um yeah and so look let's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:03">0:29:03-0:29:08</a>:</strong>  put the the current situation aside a little bit because obviously it's going to play into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:08">0:29:08-0:29:13</a>:</strong>  anything that you would talk about for the current context and moving into the future<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:13">0:29:13-0:29:18</a>:</strong>  but um so look you've traveled a lot in your life and you've consulted with and visited<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:18">0:29:18-0:29:22</a>:</strong>  farms all over the world so i'd imagine that you have a really good reference for comparison<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:22">0:29:22-0:29:26</a>:</strong>  and this is something that i'm really trying to understand better since i'm new to europe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:26">0:29:26-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  and though i've worked on farms in new zealand australia guatemala us all over the place<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:39</a>:</strong>  um i'm still struggling to kind of understand what some of the advantages and disadvantages<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:39">0:29:39-0:29:44</a>:</strong>  to starting farming enterprises specifically in europe particularly when it comes to factors<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:44">0:29:44-0:29:48</a>:</strong>  like markets land access and regulations a lot of the things that really determine the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:48">0:29:48-0:29:55</a>:</strong>  success in the initial stages can you speak on that a little yeah um well it's a big one<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:29:55">0:29:55-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  but i it's different by country europe is not one thing anymore yes africa or america<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  is right but within that well i'd say it's much more diverse than america and probably<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:21</a>:</strong>  much less diverse than africa but i mean america the differences between the states there are<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:21">0:30:21-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  nothing like the differences between european countries and cultures i mean it's it's it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:34</a>:</strong>  not comparable so the markets are very different all over the place you know here in northern<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:34">0:30:34-0:30:41</a>:</strong>  europe these are very affluent countries where people typically like to prioritize spending<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:41">0:30:41-0:30:48</a>:</strong>  as little as possible on meaningful things like good food but they will always have like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:48">0:30:48-0:30:55</a>:</strong>  the latest iphone and the biggest tv and all these kind of things so it's a bit of a conundrum<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:31:01</a>:</strong>  you know it doesn't like i live next door to a multi-multi millionaire who will drive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:01">0:31:01-0:31:07</a>:</strong>  out of their way extra 20 kilometers to buy you know from like one of these super cheap<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:07">0:31:07-0:31:12</a>:</strong>  chains like little or something but it's not it's a different one in sweden but that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:12">0:31:12-0:31:17</a>:</strong>  someone that can afford to eat anything they want you know so that's a it's a funny thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:17">0:31:17-0:31:23</a>:</strong>  you right next to them yeah they're super sweet people but it's like it it's an affluent<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  place but the cost of living is high and the cost of taxation is high here i've been surprised<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:34</a>:</strong>  actually as i've been connected to germany a bunch in the last year or two and it's there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:34">0:31:34-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  a lot going on in germany right now and i've been surprised to see nearly all organic good<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:51</a>:</strong>  produce the sorts of things we produce is more expensive in germany and all feed costs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:51">0:31:51-0:31:57</a>:</strong>  etc are lower so there's some great little businesses starting up there but in terms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:31:57">0:31:57-0:32:02</a>:</strong>  of northern europe because i think it's quite different in the east and the south obviously<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:10</a>:</strong>  but the market here is is good and strong and people are fairly receptive i'd say like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:10">0:32:10-0:32:17</a>:</strong>  the nordic countries up here it's quite new like if you go down a bit to france germany<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:17">0:32:17-0:32:26</a>:</strong>  holland belgium england people have more choice naturally you know like here the i think also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:26">0:32:26-0:32:32</a>:</strong>  because the population is very limited here so inside stockholm you can find what you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:32">0:32:32-0:32:37</a>:</strong>  want but out in the rural places like this there just isn't much competition i mean i<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:37">0:32:37-0:32:45</a>:</strong>  i bought pastured boilers to sweden they didn't exist you know and the idea of pastured eggmobiles<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:45">0:32:45-0:32:50</a>:</strong>  i don't think anyone was doing that when i got here so these are things that are quite<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:50">0:32:50-0:32:55</a>:</strong>  old and common in many places but certainly in sweden it's you know we've really pioneered<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:32:55">0:32:55-0:33:02</a>:</strong>  a lot of these things and it's starting to catch on which is great so so our market situation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:02">0:33:02-0:33:09</a>:</strong>  is quite different to to a lot of places in europe where these things are familiar and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:09">0:33:09-0:33:14</a>:</strong>  you you're going to have more competition going on and also population density where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:14">0:33:14-0:33:20</a>:</strong>  you know i know people at home in the uk that sell everything from their farms within a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:20">0:33:20-0:33:26</a>:</strong>  few miles of their farm and we don't even have people living a few miles from our farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:26">0:33:26-0:33:35</a>:</strong>  so it's it's a the access to market i would say yes and it's you can't speak across europe<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:35">0:33:35-0:33:42</a>:</strong>  in that way it's so different and in terms of land access that's what makes this country<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:42">0:33:42-0:33:49</a>:</strong>  is why i moved to this country because i could buy a farm with cash and you know this farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:49">0:33:49-0:33:56</a>:</strong>  costs me 90 000 euros and i've put about 110 000 euros in doing it up and it's turning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:33:56">0:33:56-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  over more than that combined sum every six months but in england this farm would be a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:08</a>:</strong>  million euros and probably you'd have to rebuild all the buildings to meet regulations and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:08">0:34:08-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  your selling price for all the products we produce here would be lower so it's why i've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  put so much of my educational efforts into crunching numbers and getting your contacts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:26</a>:</strong>  clear because it's like you can i have no doubt whatever country you drop me in i could<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:26">0:34:26-0:34:32</a>:</strong>  plan a business that will function but it's going to look different according to land<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:32">0:34:32-0:34:37</a>:</strong>  prices infrastructure prices and the market accessibility that's something that each and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:37">0:34:37-0:34:45</a>:</strong>  everyone has to thoroughly analyze for themselves because i i definitely can relate to like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:45">0:34:45-0:34:51</a>:</strong>  you know the the long-term trainings we've been doing at our farm each year are have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:51">0:34:51-0:34:57</a>:</strong>  been so critical for so many people starting out and it's a reality check it's a springboard<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:34:57">0:34:57-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  and a reality check that's what this farm really is it's you know people come here with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:02">0:35:02-0:35:09</a>:</strong>  a pie in the sky dream of wanting to do this and that and it's like it it soon gets slapped<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:09">0:35:09-0:35:14</a>:</strong>  out of them you know and many people come with a dream of being a market gardener and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:14">0:35:14-0:35:19</a>:</strong>  they leave and set up a chicken business and they thrive in it and they work half the time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:19">0:35:19-0:35:28</a>:</strong>  and earn more and it's it's really important that people first clarify their context and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:28">0:35:28-0:35:34</a>:</strong>  then plan a business and i think a lot of it's this it's the same dilemma i've been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:34">0:35:34-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  playing with for the last years it's the future of this type of farming relies on the flexible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:47</a>:</strong>  minded entrepreneurial folks that aren't coming from a long line of farmers stuck in their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:47">0:35:47-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  way stuck in pride and arrogance this is how we do it grandfather did it like this i do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:35:58</a>:</strong>  it like this and certainly down spain portugal you have the most glaring examples of that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:35:58">0:35:58-0:36:07</a>:</strong>  where they're plowing bare terracotta soils under their almonds and and carob trees and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:07">0:36:07-0:36:12</a>:</strong>  it's pride and arrogance and it's yeah well it's i see it all around me and i'm not even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:12">0:36:12-0:36:17</a>:</strong>  in one of the worst areas yeah well it's glaring the obvious there but the same thing happens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:17">0:36:17-0:36:23</a>:</strong>  all over it's just we've got a bit more humidity to to cover it up but yeah not as brittle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:23">0:36:23-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  of the ecosystem well so look yeah what you're talking about let's let's go in a little bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:31</a>:</strong>  deeper to that um like i've been speaking to regenerative ag practitioners teachers<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:31">0:36:31-0:36:36</a>:</strong>  and advocates for a good few years now and one of the reasons why i keep coming back<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:36">0:36:36-0:36:41</a>:</strong>  to your information and resources is because of your really thorough analysis of those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:41">0:36:41-0:36:47</a>:</strong>  farm enterprises and the special financial modeling that helps you to make essential<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:47">0:36:47-0:36:53</a>:</strong>  decisions on your own farm and its development so like you kind of glossed over some of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:53">0:36:53-0:36:58</a>:</strong>  criteria that helps you decide on what business enterprises are going to be worthwhile for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:36:58">0:36:58-0:37:03</a>:</strong>  you can you kind of walk me through some of the essential questions and information gathering<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:03">0:37:03-0:37:11</a>:</strong>  that you do when you're assessing a potential enterprise yeah well you know the yeah i'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:11">0:37:11-0:37:20</a>:</strong>  try to do that and i think the the the the true answer to that is the book i wrote now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:20">0:37:20-0:37:25</a>:</strong>  i'm not just saying that to promote my book but that's exactly why i wrote regenerative<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:25">0:37:25-0:37:32</a>:</strong>  agriculture that's entirely what the book is addressing because i just felt like that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:32">0:37:32-0:37:38</a>:</strong>  has been my um my quarantine reading i've finally started to break down that book and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:38">0:37:38-0:37:41</a>:</strong>  read it all the way through like a novel whereas before i kind of skimmed it because it's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:41">0:37:41-0:37:50</a>:</strong>  700 page more uh volume worth getting through but i i highly recommend it yeah well the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:50">0:37:50-0:37:59</a>:</strong>  reason that came about is i would have people come in here on their training and you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:37:59">0:37:59-0:38:05</a>:</strong>  they would say right i've got three hectares i want to do microdaring it's like no you'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:05">0:38:05-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  never make economy out of that or i inherited my father's 100 acre farm in the south of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:19</a>:</strong>  england and i want to set up a market garden it's just like no that that's not responsible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:19">0:38:19-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  enough it's like people will give their leg for that farm and you just want to make a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:31</a>:</strong>  little market garden in the corner yeah so like something about taking responsibility<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:31">0:38:31-0:38:37</a>:</strong>  and and seeing the bigger picture is part of it now in terms of that's not to say anyone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:37">0:38:37-0:38:41</a>:</strong>  should do anything it's it really of course must come down to to their context and most<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:41">0:38:41-0:38:48</a>:</strong>  people aren't very clear about that so that's always the first bit we do but when it comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:48">0:38:48-0:38:54</a>:</strong>  down like the the reason i wrote the book and i i it was a torturous process because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:38:54">0:38:54-0:39:00</a>:</strong>  i'm trying to compare like 13 14 different enterprises to give people a starting point<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:00">0:39:00-0:39:05</a>:</strong>  because i know most people coming into this type of farming aren't from a farming background<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:05">0:39:05-0:39:10</a>:</strong>  and when people aren't from a farming background they have no sense of scale they have no sense<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:10">0:39:10-0:39:19</a>:</strong>  of life cycles and seasonal flows they have no sense of how heavy a machine is and why<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:19">0:39:19-0:39:25</a>:</strong>  you shouldn't stick your arm in there and you know it's it's very clear the practicalities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:25">0:39:25-0:39:32</a>:</strong>  of both action and thinking of someone that's grown up in this way and so what i wanted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:32">0:39:32-0:39:37</a>:</strong>  to do is present people with like look okay you've just told me you have six hectares<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:37">0:39:37-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  you have 50 000 euros to invest and you need to make 30 000 euros a year to maintain your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:48</a>:</strong>  quality of life cool here are three things that fit the bill and everything else here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:48">0:39:48-0:39:54</a>:</strong>  clearly doesn't right so now you've got a starting point so give up your dream to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:54">0:39:54-0:39:59</a>:</strong>  a snail farmer and have a look at these three things let's plug in the numbers to these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:39:59">0:39:59-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  spreadsheets let's look at how the daily workflow would look the seasonal workflow would look<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:09</a>:</strong>  let's have a go out in the field let's do it every day and see do you actually like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:09">0:40:09-0:40:16</a>:</strong>  this you know do you enjoy it and where could you make a unique in road into the market<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:16">0:40:16-0:40:21</a>:</strong>  where you live etc so so once the context is clear what people actually want to do with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:21">0:40:21-0:40:27</a>:</strong>  their lives and their time then it comes down to numbers and size it's like how much size<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:27">0:40:27-0:40:36</a>:</strong>  do you need to run this micro dairy to get you 45 000 euros out net okay well you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:36">0:40:36-0:40:40</a>:</strong>  not in sweden here in sweden it's going to look like this for me because it takes me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:40">0:40:40-0:40:48</a>:</strong>  this much land to feed a cow but down where you are oh you can feed a cow on 60 of that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:48">0:40:48-0:40:54</a>:</strong>  land okay so let's adjust this to your setting so we can really get into the nuts and bolts<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:40:54">0:40:54-0:41:02</a>:</strong>  and lay out a form of recipe and then people actually can see the vision and actuate it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:02">0:41:02-0:41:07</a>:</strong>  and that's been really successful with our training participants but it really comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:07">0:41:07-0:41:16</a>:</strong>  down to a lot of thinking and and visualization and a lot of analysis of numbers yeah and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:16">0:41:16-0:41:21</a>:</strong>  that's one of the things that i like that's so well outlined in the book is that it really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:21">0:41:21-0:41:26</a>:</strong>  it profiles these enterprises that you've tested really well now definitely you've tested<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:26">0:41:26-0:41:31</a>:</strong>  them to your specific context but by sliding the meters and adjusting the numbers specific<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:31">0:41:31-0:41:35</a>:</strong>  to where someone is and what the resources are they're working with these are pretty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:35">0:41:35-0:41:44</a>:</strong>  well able to adapt to most of what's within this continent here i would say so i think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:44">0:41:44-0:41:50</a>:</strong>  it's relevant across the states canada all over i mean i know people are taking a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:50">0:41:50-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  of benefit from it in weird wonderful places where i wouldn't expect it to be of use but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:03</a>:</strong>  um all the better it's just the resilience of the other model yeah and the pattern aspect<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:03">0:42:03-0:42:11</a>:</strong>  of it is applicable to anything but it i think it's really yeah as i said i i could apply<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:11">0:42:11-0:42:17</a>:</strong>  this to anywhere i would need to do the same thinking that that person needs to do but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:17">0:42:17-0:42:23</a>:</strong>  i can prompt that person to do that thinking quicker and more efficiently and i can also<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:23">0:42:23-0:42:30</a>:</strong>  set the boundaries by denying them the right to follow a certain thought train if i just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:30">0:42:30-0:42:40</a>:</strong>  can see it's ridiculous you know so part of my work is actually carefully weaving the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:40">0:42:40-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  the sort of financial and ecological aspect with their social spiritual life and and in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:51">0:42:51-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  that i'm quite careful to to step back and step forward to work with that person's unique<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:06</a>:</strong>  character and temperament but but i'm very quick to shut down things that are not helpful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:06">0:43:06-0:43:12</a>:</strong>  you know people often want a dream and not see things as they are and i don't know how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:12">0:43:12-0:43:18</a>:</strong>  to explain that very clearly but but i guess it's a it's an element of mentoring you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:18">0:43:18-0:43:24</a>:</strong>  yeah i'm sort of accelerating their thinking pathway as well as their practical skills<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:24">0:43:24-0:43:31</a>:</strong>  pathway but but it really helps to run those numbers and we're doing a lot of background<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:31">0:43:31-0:43:37</a>:</strong>  work this year to really up the ante with the online things that we can offer to help<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:37">0:43:37-0:43:43</a>:</strong>  people get started because i think it's so helpful for people like you can you can get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:43">0:43:43-0:43:51</a>:</strong>  someone to drop this fantasy they've had for years just by looking through one data set<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:51">0:43:51-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  yeah you know it just becomes startlingly obvious to someone like no this is not possible<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  and another thing that's another thing that i i see in that is that some people are guilty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:03">0:44:03-0:44:10</a>:</strong>  about making a living you know some people have a very hard time setting the price on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:10">0:44:10-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  their time you know a lot of people just want to get by and say well what's that look like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:22</a>:</strong>  do you need 10 grand a year do you need 150 grand a year to get by what does that actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:22">0:44:22-0:44:26</a>:</strong>  mean a lot of people can't answer that very clearly particularly young people because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:26">0:44:26-0:44:31</a>:</strong>  it's mostly young people that are coming into our training program as they're about to really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:31">0:44:31-0:44:37</a>:</strong>  springboard off and set this up but once those things are clear once your holistic context<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:37">0:44:37-0:44:42</a>:</strong>  is clear and your financial means and needs are clear then it's pretty straightforward<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:42">0:44:42-0:44:50</a>:</strong>  to set up a recipe that is likely to lead to success if diligence hard work commitment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:50">0:44:50-0:44:55</a>:</strong>  are present and if those things aren't present i doubt anything's going to work you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:44:55">0:44:55-0:45:00</a>:</strong>  no one even knows the numbers all you want but if you're not willing to work for it yeah<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:00">0:45:00-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  i don't know any successful business person who hasn't put the time in you know we've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:12</a>:</strong>  all done years of 100 hour weeks everyone i know that's been successful yeah and if<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:12">0:45:12-0:45:19</a>:</strong>  you've got that kind of spirit then then this is a life you can do for sure so so i think<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:19">0:45:19-0:45:24</a>:</strong>  that's i don't know and like you said really giving the reality for it but also the hope<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:24">0:45:24-0:45:29</a>:</strong>  that if you put in the work if you really do proper assessments this is not an unrealistic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:29">0:45:29-0:45:35</a>:</strong>  thing despite a lot of what we see in the news about you know farming being in a not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:35">0:45:35-0:45:40</a>:</strong>  profitable lifestyle or just something that isn't viable in the modern context because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:40">0:45:40-0:45:44</a>:</strong>  it it throws a wrench in both sides of it so you don't go too far with the dreaming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:45:51</a>:</strong>  aspect and and start you know a bunch of enterprises that you can't possibly make meet uh make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:51">0:45:51-0:45:57</a>:</strong>  the ends meet on but also redefining the the possibilities at the same time and that middle<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:45:57">0:45:57-0:46:04</a>:</strong>  line is really important for people to understand yeah and something i've been i haven't fully<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:04">0:46:04-0:46:11</a>:</strong>  formulated my thoughts around it but it it's it's around temperament and character and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:11">0:46:11-0:46:16</a>:</strong>  that i like definitely farming is not for everyone and i'm becoming i guess what i'm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:16">0:46:16-0:46:23</a>:</strong>  trying to say is i'm becoming more confident in telling people that when i identify that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:23">0:46:23-0:46:31</a>:</strong>  because i'm in this i'm in a strange situation where you know i have i'm very careful how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:31">0:46:31-0:46:36</a>:</strong>  i approach the interns that come here we go through a very deep process because we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:36">0:46:36-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  living very closely in each other's space and characteristically i've been spending<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:47</a>:</strong>  you know from 6 30 in the morning till in the old days till eight nine ten o'clock at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:47">0:46:47-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  night with them for months and so i'm very i've watched a lot and i'm really scoping<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:46:55">0:46:55-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  out where people are at and trying to address them in a way that will speak to them where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:09</a>:</strong>  they're at but i'm i'm not afraid to say anything to anyone but i definitely see i'm becoming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:09">0:47:09-0:47:16</a>:</strong>  more confident to encourage people to consider other things if i see that they don't have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:16">0:47:16-0:47:22</a>:</strong>  the spirit that it takes well speak on that for a little minute then what what is it that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:22">0:47:22-0:47:26</a>:</strong>  you noticed that you would define as the spirit that it takes to to have this type of line<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:26">0:47:26-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  of work and lifestyle i think it focuses or is centered around like commitment discipline<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:47:49</a>:</strong>  the ability to create like to optimize workflows and the ability to put those things into every<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:49">0:47:49-0:47:59</a>:</strong>  single element of life so i i would see like the people that have that spirit have that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:47:59">0:47:59-0:48:07</a>:</strong>  spirit in everything they do in life you know whether it's work rest study playing and there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:07">0:48:07-0:48:14</a>:</strong>  always people that want a bit of spoon feeding and it's like hey you know you paid money<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:14">0:48:14-0:48:18</a>:</strong>  to come here and learn you want me to spoon feed you it's like if you if you haven't got<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:18">0:48:18-0:48:24</a>:</strong>  that get up and get them thing it's like you're not you're not gonna make it in this field<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:24">0:48:24-0:48:30</a>:</strong>  because it's like running a business i don't know anyone that runs any type of business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:30">0:48:30-0:48:37</a>:</strong>  that isn't hustling and putting that time in and they're working hard and fast for years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:37">0:48:37-0:48:44</a>:</strong>  and on top of that it's a farm business it's like you know there's no steeper road to climb<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:44">0:48:44-0:48:53</a>:</strong>  there's so many variables yeah no it's totally doable but it it's not for everyone and i<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:48:53">0:48:53-0:49:00</a>:</strong>  think that everyone that i've identified that's succeeding that has passed through our place<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:00">0:49:00-0:49:06</a>:</strong>  and through our trainings whatever they've all got that same characteristic they they've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:06">0:49:06-0:49:15</a>:</strong>  come here as a paid they're paying for training and they will put in the same energy and dedication<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:15">0:49:15-0:49:22</a>:</strong>  as if they were getting paid any amount of salary like it's not you know it doesn't the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:22">0:49:22-0:49:29</a>:</strong>  life circumstances aren't affecting their commitment and dedication to showing up moment<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:29">0:49:29-0:49:35</a>:</strong>  to moment in life and that's that's the fundamental characteristic and do you feel like that is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:35">0:49:35-0:49:41</a>:</strong>  something that can be taught or either you've got it or you know that's the thing you've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:41">0:49:41-0:49:46</a>:</strong>  either got it or you've got you could teach yourself that but not not it's not the right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:46">0:49:46-0:49:51</a>:</strong>  word it's not about teaching yourself that you you can develop yourself and that might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:51">0:49:51-0:49:57</a>:</strong>  arise i guess is another way to say that but you can't teach someone that i'm very clear<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:49:57">0:49:57-0:50:03</a>:</strong>  about that the way that we've created that culture here is i demonstrate that through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:03">0:50:03-0:50:10</a>:</strong>  my work ethic and i've chosen to surround myself as far as possible with a team who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:10">0:50:10-0:50:16</a>:</strong>  click straight into that and we don't sit around and talk about it we're demonstrating<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:16">0:50:16-0:50:23</a>:</strong>  it to the point that you would feel out of place if you weren't in that same vibe you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:23">0:50:23-0:50:31</a>:</strong>  know and that has a massive influence on people you know it can pick people out of weird frames<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:31">0:50:31-0:50:37</a>:</strong>  of mind and perspectives and it can it can empower them and change the way they interact<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:37">0:50:37-0:50:46</a>:</strong>  that's on the one end but it it can clearly demonstrate to other people that they're not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:46">0:50:46-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  there they're not up for it you know which is a useful outcome too yeah i mean but i<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:58</a>:</strong>  think i i definitely think you can't teach them that you can inspire someone but people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:50:58">0:50:58-0:51:05</a>:</strong>  tend to have to go through these kind of kairos moments you know some kind of like often people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:05">0:51:05-0:51:13</a>:</strong>  need to go through the depths of depression or burnout or heartache or loss to to step<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:13">0:51:13-0:51:18</a>:</strong>  up their level of responsibility and showing up in the world you know some people have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:18">0:51:18-0:51:23</a>:</strong>  always done that but i don't think you can lead someone there you can just demonstrate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:23">0:51:23-0:51:29</a>:</strong>  it and that can influence people but i don't think you can teach that i don't i've never<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:29">0:51:29-0:51:37</a>:</strong>  met anyone that can teach that that would be the next challenge well so look we've talked<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:37">0:51:37-0:51:41</a>:</strong>  a lot about kind of setting up a resilient business model and certainly in the last handful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:41">0:51:41-0:51:46</a>:</strong>  of years it's been less than a decade now since you got ridgedale off the ground and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:46">0:51:46-0:51:51</a>:</strong>  have put out all these resources on the steps that you've taken to make this happen you've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:51">0:51:51-0:51:55</a>:</strong>  passed some really impressive milestones on the farm development and it seems that a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:51:55">0:51:55-0:52:00</a>:</strong>  of your initial building and enterprise development is kind of given way now to fine tuning maintenance<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:00">0:52:00-0:52:06</a>:</strong>  and increasing efficiency so my question is what does it look like for your daily schedule<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:06">0:52:06-0:52:11</a>:</strong>  and has it changed how you observe and run the farm now or are you just kind of taking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:11">0:52:11-0:52:18</a>:</strong>  on more projects now that the initial ones are kind of running well it's a it's an interesting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:18">0:52:18-0:52:25</a>:</strong>  year to ask that because i wasn't planning to actually be on the farm all year this year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:25">0:52:25-0:52:31</a>:</strong>  so my plan this year so the last couple of years i've really started to notice the impact<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:31">0:52:31-0:52:38</a>:</strong>  we've had now you know i get a lot of email and messages and i i'm aware of some of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:38">0:52:38-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  influence but the last couple of years i've really noticed it i've seen hundreds of egg<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:51</a>:</strong>  mobiles that look like ours all over the world popping up i've seen so many people take our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:51">0:52:51-0:52:58</a>:</strong>  approach to market gardening and scale it and run with it and run their businesses i've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:52:58">0:52:58-0:53:07</a>:</strong>  seen other people making micro abattoirs based on ours and i decided last year that i wanted<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:07">0:53:07-0:53:15</a>:</strong>  to take a year off to rest a bit because i got to the edge of burnout and to the point<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:15">0:53:15-0:53:20</a>:</strong>  where i decided no i need a year out and really get perspective on where to put my energy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:20">0:53:20-0:53:27</a>:</strong>  now because i'm in a pretty interesting place now where i have a full-time job outside the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:27">0:53:27-0:53:37</a>:</strong>  farm also and i have a child and so it's i need to really get a bit of perspective on where's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:37">0:53:37-0:53:44</a>:</strong>  best to put my energy to fulfill the educational objectives i have running the farm now last<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:44">0:53:44-0:53:51</a>:</strong>  year we took back interns again so i'm working with a small group of up to 10 people and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:51">0:53:51-0:53:56</a>:</strong>  i love that program because there's like basically it's a program for people who've realized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:56">0:53:56-0:53:59</a>:</strong>  they want to go to ag school but ag school is not going to give them anything like what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:53:59">0:53:59-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  they need and that's what that program is for it's it's the highest level of engagement<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:12</a>:</strong>  in regenerative ag that i've ever seen offered anywhere in the planet it's three months full<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:12">0:54:12-0:54:22</a>:</strong>  time half in the class studying very intensely and then targeted work in the field to experience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:22">0:54:22-0:54:28</a>:</strong>  the particular things that are in the program so they're not really running the farm they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:28">0:54:28-0:54:34</a>:</strong>  doing targeted work experience to give them the confidence to leave with the business<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:34">0:54:34-0:54:39</a>:</strong>  plan and land plan that they've created during that time and many of them have i would say<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:39">0:54:39-0:54:46</a>:</strong>  a high proportion have gone off and done that but last year it was a group of a lot of young<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:46">0:54:46-0:54:53</a>:</strong>  people and i noticed the age gap is increasing and i don't mean that just in that i'm getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:54:53">0:54:53-0:55:02</a>:</strong>  older i also mean that i'm concerned about generations in their early 20s now the the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:02">0:55:02-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  loss of the value of things that i hold dear like commitment discipline living by your<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:14</a>:</strong>  word if you say you're doing something you are reliable and trustworthy so these things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:14">0:55:14-0:55:23</a>:</strong>  don't seem as valued anymore the world is changing in a very rapid way that such that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:23">0:55:23-0:55:29</a>:</strong>  the generation gaps are getting shorter i think and i still hold a lot of the values<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:29">0:55:29-0:55:35</a>:</strong>  of my parents generation very dear and i believe that they're fundamental to the well-being<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:35">0:55:35-0:55:42</a>:</strong>  of our society so i'm a little concerned about things and i got pretty demotivated last year<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:42">0:55:42-0:55:50</a>:</strong>  because i felt like i'm putting a stupid amount of energy into what i do and it's to a very<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:50">0:55:50-0:55:56</a>:</strong>  limited group of people some of whom i know do not even understand the benefit of what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:55:56">0:55:56-0:56:03</a>:</strong>  going on here and will not put this to use and why am i giving my time like this because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:03">0:56:03-0:56:09</a>:</strong>  i'm getting older and tired i'm getting tired i can't work at the rate i used to so i really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:09">0:56:09-0:56:16</a>:</strong>  started to consider like how better to leverage my work and that led me to really consider<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:16">0:56:16-0:56:22</a>:</strong>  how to leverage what i do online and to try and collaborate with other people because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:22">0:56:22-0:56:28</a>:</strong>  i don't have time and don't have the skills to really leverage that and so what i decided<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:28">0:56:28-0:56:35</a>:</strong>  to do was take a year off the farm to actually travel around europe and see all the farms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:35">0:56:35-0:56:41</a>:</strong>  that we've influenced and that our students have set up and go film them and document<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:41">0:56:41-0:56:46</a>:</strong>  them and for me that would be a big rest it would be really interesting to see what we've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:46">0:56:46-0:56:53</a>:</strong>  spawned and it would also fulfill another strong function which is for yohana to take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:53">0:56:53-0:56:59</a>:</strong>  more of a leadership role outside on the farm operation because she's been very much central<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:56:59">0:56:59-0:57:10</a>:</strong>  to the sales and communications in the background and so i kind of felt like alleviating the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:10">0:57:10-0:57:15</a>:</strong>  focus on me i started to feel like people were coming here not for the value of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:15">0:57:15-0:57:25</a>:</strong>  training that was being led but all becoming increasingly influenced by me you know like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:25">0:57:25-0:57:31</a>:</strong>  becoming for me in some way and becoming a farming guru yeah yeah and i'm not happy about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:31">0:57:31-0:57:39</a>:</strong>  that you know so so i felt like it was forming into this really nice thing that was leading<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:39">0:57:39-0:57:46</a>:</strong>  to our context our family context changing into like we felt like we needed to address<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:46">0:57:46-0:57:54</a>:</strong>  that time has been a limiting factor and we decided we wanted you know take it a bit easier<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:54">0:57:54-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  and take a bit of the the fruit take a bit of the harvest of the work we've put in because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:07</a>:</strong>  i calculated while i was away on an extended holiday this winter i calculated that i've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:07">0:58:07-0:58:14</a>:</strong>  put in 15 years of work weeks on the actual farm in the last six years that's the hours<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:14">0:58:14-0:58:22</a>:</strong>  i've put in and i can't do that anymore and i don't need to do that anymore so so actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:22">0:58:22-0:58:28</a>:</strong>  yeah i plan to be away all summer and do this project which looks like i won't be able to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:28">0:58:28-0:58:37</a>:</strong>  travel but i'm rapidly creating a online solution to that with a collaborator so that's been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:37">0:58:37-0:58:42</a>:</strong>  another big thing that's happened for me is i finally found someone to closely collaborate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:42">0:58:42-0:58:50</a>:</strong>  with and tell me about that and i know the farming like a hero is is the name of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:50">0:58:50-0:58:54</a>:</strong>  project and and that a lot of things are kind of up in the air now and perhaps the travel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:54">0:58:54-0:58:59</a>:</strong>  won't be possible but do you want to kind of outline some of the things that are coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:58:59">0:58:59-0:59:07</a>:</strong>  available and the collaboration that you're getting into yeah so we um well this lady's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:07">0:59:07-0:59:17</a>:</strong>  danish lady who who contacted me and wrote me a very clear well thought through structured<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:17">0:59:17-0:59:25</a>:</strong>  proposal of how she could use her professional skills to leverage what i'm doing and it really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:25">0:59:25-0:59:31</a>:</strong>  struck my attention because i've always seen that education is going fully online and that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:31">0:59:31-0:59:37</a>:</strong>  schools will just not be necessary in the future except for some kind of local mentorship<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:37">0:59:37-0:59:44</a>:</strong>  around topics that cannot be dealt with online but digital learning gives us access to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:44">0:59:44-0:59:51</a>:</strong>  best people on any subject and i think there's something very powerful about that and i thought<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:51">0:59:51-0:59:59</a>:</strong>  it was going to develop in a certain way and it seems to develop in a different you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=0:59:59">0:59:59-1:00:05</a>:</strong>  uniquely powerful around the world for how people access in knowledge and and actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:05">1:00:05-1:00:12</a>:</strong>  have attention for and so i'll be really considering that of like well why am i putting my energy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:12">1:00:12-1:00:21</a>:</strong>  into these 10 people when i could surely reach 10 000 people with the same effort and i've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:21">1:00:21-1:00:26</a>:</strong>  been you know pretty much flying solo trying to make videos trying to put together stuff<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:33</a>:</strong>  for people like resources but it's it's definitely true that having someone professional that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:33">1:00:33-1:00:40</a>:</strong>  knows how to package that and present that is you know able to reach far more people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:40">1:00:40-1:00:48</a>:</strong>  in a powerful way and so this lady wrote a year-long plan step by step of how to basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:48">1:00:48-1:00:53</a>:</strong>  overhaul everything i do online and i was like wow this is perfect because i've been<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:53">1:00:53-1:00:59</a>:</strong>  looking for someone to collaborate or support me for years but it's not it's not a job i<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:00:59">1:00:59-1:01:05</a>:</strong>  could offer someone because the time it would take me to train someone to help me i may<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:05">1:01:05-1:01:13</a>:</strong>  as well do it myself yeah i've just kept on doing it myself so to find someone who already<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:13">1:01:13-1:01:19</a>:</strong>  has followed us for years has taken our online training has read our book who knows enough<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:19">1:01:19-1:01:24</a>:</strong>  about me to know the context of how i'm approaching things and can already foresee exactly how<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:24">1:01:24-1:01:32</a>:</strong>  they can help is powerful and perfect so so what happened with that is the first part<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:32">1:01:32-1:01:37</a>:</strong>  of it is to try and bring a lot more value with this tour so my original idea is right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:37">1:01:37-1:01:41</a>:</strong>  i'm going to jump in my truck drive around europe film all these farms and chuck it on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:41">1:01:41-1:01:49</a>:</strong>  youtube and that's all good in one way but we felt like there's a lot more we could do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:49">1:01:49-1:01:55</a>:</strong>  with that and one big part of that is creating community like to help people connect like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:01:55">1:01:55-1:02:01</a>:</strong>  something i noticed when i filmed a few of our students farms in the last couple of years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:01">1:02:01-1:02:06</a>:</strong>  is that when i put those videos online they all started connecting up and i noticed that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:06">1:02:06-1:02:12</a>:</strong>  through ridgedale is a lot of the interns and core team have connected across the years<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:12">1:02:12-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  and it's an amazing network this there are a dozen farms in europe that are run by our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:25</a>:</strong>  interns and they work and cross-pollinate between each other i know interns that have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:25">1:02:25-1:02:30</a>:</strong>  worked at five different people's farms who are all interns here wow and there's farms<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:30">1:02:30-1:02:36</a>:</strong>  run by three of our interns who are all from different years here you know and like these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:36">1:02:36-1:02:42</a>:</strong>  connections are amazing and i've been thinking about also this one degree of separation or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:42">1:02:42-1:02:50</a>:</strong>  two degrees of separation where it's like you know if i like i know what i've exposed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:50">1:02:50-1:02:58</a>:</strong>  my interns and network too and because i've spent a long time with them i got a good sense<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:02:58">1:02:58-1:03:04</a>:</strong>  of who they are and how they think so if this guy who's worked with me for a season here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:04">1:03:04-1:03:12</a>:</strong>  says this guy is trustworthy and cool then that one degree of separation is okay and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:12">1:03:12-1:03:17</a>:</strong>  that's how we build a network i've had people here sent here by some of the most famous<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:17">1:03:17-1:03:23</a>:</strong>  people in the field who have just turned out to be absolutely not useful with us and they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:23">1:03:23-1:03:28</a>:</strong>  might have been perfect with that other person but their context is so entirely different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:28">1:03:28-1:03:34</a>:</strong>  that it just doesn't translate right that's not to say anything bad about anyone it seems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:34">1:03:34-1:03:40</a>:</strong>  like a natural consequence of different contexts but by keeping a certain degree of separation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:40">1:03:40-1:03:45</a>:</strong>  you can avoid that because there's so many people looking you know i get asked daily<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:45">1:03:45-1:03:50</a>:</strong>  by email do you know a good place in europe to go and learn about agroforestry or whatever<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:50">1:03:50-1:03:59</a>:</strong>  it is so the skill of a good network is going to be keeping it so it's not open to everyone<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:03:59">1:03:59-1:04:04</a>:</strong>  you know it's open to one degree of separation so everyone can vouch for everyone not vouch<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:04">1:04:04-1:04:10</a>:</strong>  for but you know what i mean like it keeps the connections tight yeah yeah so so that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:10">1:04:10-1:04:15</a>:</strong>  another piece that we want to do is like after seeing like the people that i made little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:15">1:04:15-1:04:21</a>:</strong>  videos with it brings some a massive amount of attention and it starts them all connecting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:21">1:04:21-1:04:28</a>:</strong>  together and i notice a lot of people look to the states to watch videos whatever it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:28">1:04:28-1:04:32</a>:</strong>  like man we have so much going on in europe and loads better stuff in fact most of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:32">1:04:32-1:04:37</a>:</strong>  stuff going on in the states was inspired and came from europe it's just you don't know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:37">1:04:37-1:04:43</a>:</strong>  about that person and so that's i started thinking i'll call it the unsung hero tour<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:43">1:04:43-1:04:48</a>:</strong>  i'm gonna put these people on a pedestal and use my platform to shine light on these people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:48">1:04:48-1:04:51</a>:</strong>  who do awesome stuff that you haven't heard of because we've all heard of the famous names<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:51">1:04:51-1:04:56</a>:</strong>  the joe salins etc but it's like what about this dude over here that no one's heard of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:04:56">1:04:56-1:05:04</a>:</strong>  who's awesome at doing this thing and then that was the basis of the tour and so we decided<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:04">1:05:04-1:05:10</a>:</strong>  to keep on the hero theme but it's going to be called farm like a hero tour it's going<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:10">1:05:10-1:05:16</a>:</strong>  to be called the farm like a hero experience but we're gonna start off by doing like zoom<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:16">1:05:16-1:05:24</a>:</strong>  meetings like we're on now yeah and if possible later in the summer i'll go on the tour still<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:24">1:05:24-1:05:31</a>:</strong>  on whichever bits i can there's no doubt that the film i can make on the farm a long form<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:31">1:05:31-1:05:36</a>:</strong>  video of an hour and a half with with the farmer is going to be much more compelling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:36">1:05:36-1:05:42</a>:</strong>  and informative so it's not like people said well why don't you do that next year but i<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:42">1:05:42-1:05:47</a>:</strong>  can't just leave my farm for a year it's pretty unprecedented that i was gonna leave this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:47">1:05:47-1:05:53</a>:</strong>  year and i have a family also so it's not so simple i can't just go next year so i decided<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:05:53">1:05:53-1:06:00</a>:</strong>  okay i'm prepared to do it fully in conference calls if need be but the way we can make more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:00">1:06:00-1:06:08</a>:</strong>  value out of that is to create an ebook with all these farms so here's 100 farms and we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:08">1:06:08-1:06:14</a>:</strong>  ask them to write 5000 words and tell us their revenue and their net and the investments<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:14">1:06:14-1:06:19</a>:</strong>  they've put in the things that are going good you know get some data out of there so that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:19">1:06:19-1:06:26</a>:</strong>  by the end of it we've got 100 awesome regenerative farms around europe and it's like oh so can<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:26">1:06:26-1:06:31</a>:</strong>  you tell me somewhere good that i can go and learn about quail production it's like well<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:31">1:06:31-1:06:38</a>:</strong>  there you go bam have a look at that and really create this resource yeah so we're going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:38">1:06:38-1:06:46</a>:</strong>  build a dedicated facebook group and have live questions and answers and particularly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:46">1:06:46-1:06:52</a>:</strong>  be speaking and connecting people around country specific stuff so how people are dealing with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:52">1:06:52-1:06:59</a>:</strong>  this coronavirus and the restrictions to selling etc how people are dealing with local regulations<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:06:59">1:06:59-1:07:03</a>:</strong>  because one thing that happens is people come they look at their eggmobiles they go home<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:03">1:07:03-1:07:07</a>:</strong>  and they build their eggmobile without checking their local regulations yeah i always tell<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:07">1:07:07-1:07:13</a>:</strong>  them to make sure that fits their context i've built it in this way for these reasons<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:13">1:07:13-1:07:18</a>:</strong>  and it doesn't mean you should build yours this way but people are looking for standardized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:18">1:07:18-1:07:24</a>:</strong>  solutions despite the fact there aren't any in farming but but this network is really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:24">1:07:24-1:07:32</a>:</strong>  needed to help people with a one degree of separation as it were now something i've noticed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:32">1:07:32-1:07:38</a>:</strong>  i don't know if you'd agree with this oliver is i feel like the era of good facebook groups<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:38">1:07:38-1:07:47</a>:</strong>  died when the old group down doctor used to run stopped that was like the last of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:47">1:07:47-1:07:52</a>:</strong>  good facebook groups i don't use facebook groups i think those kind of died before i<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:52">1:07:52-1:07:57</a>:</strong>  even got onto them and yeah i agree the quality of discourse on those is uh it's i'm sure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:07:57">1:07:57-1:08:03</a>:</strong>  it's not what it was originally intended to be no and it's not just about quality of discourse<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:03">1:08:03-1:08:09</a>:</strong>  is that i don't trust your answer to my problem with my chickens because i don't know anything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:09">1:08:09-1:08:16</a>:</strong>  about you or who you are or your context right that's where the degree of separation is important<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:16">1:08:16-1:08:21</a>:</strong>  it's like i got a whole network of people who i know enough about their thinking to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:21">1:08:21-1:08:28</a>:</strong>  know how to analyze their answers also and that's the sort of network that's really strong<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:28">1:08:28-1:08:36</a>:</strong>  so in summary yeah so in summary that's that's the plan we're gonna actually launch it as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:36">1:08:36-1:08:42</a>:</strong>  in the next few weeks uh hopefully in the beginning of may we're gonna start a subscription<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:42">1:08:42-1:08:47</a>:</strong>  site it's gonna be very cheap price of a coffee every week but it's gonna honor the you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:47">1:08:47-1:08:55</a>:</strong>  i think we're estimated to put 300 hours just into making the interviews and that's just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:08:55">1:08:55-1:09:01</a>:</strong>  if we do it on computer if i was driving around europe that's six months full-time work so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:01">1:09:01-1:09:07</a>:</strong>  it's a lot of work and it's unrealistic for me to do that completely free because i've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:07">1:09:07-1:09:15</a>:</strong>  already invested 15 grand to set up sites and learning platforms and basically as part<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:15">1:09:15-1:09:23</a>:</strong>  of a bigger project we're transitioning all our online stuff to professional more professional<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:23">1:09:23-1:09:29</a>:</strong>  uh hostings and programs to optimize that experience for people and that's what my collaborator<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:29">1:09:29-1:09:40</a>:</strong>  does she works with uh copywriting and online running online sales and promotions and branding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:40">1:09:40-1:09:47</a>:</strong>  and all this stuff all this stuff that i've kind of never studied i've done all right for myself<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:47">1:09:47-1:09:53</a>:</strong>  but to have a professional on board who knows how to leverage that can just bring far more benefit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:09:53">1:09:53-1:09:59</a>:</strong>  all over the place and take a lot of work off my shoulders which is the main help for me so<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:00">1:10:00-1:10:05</a>:</strong>  yeah and you can't do everything at a high level you it's best to focus on what you're good at and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:05">1:10:05-1:10:11</a>:</strong>  leave certain things to other professionals yes there's a lot to get a little diluted if you try<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:11">1:10:11-1:10:18</a>:</strong>  and do everything yeah it's totally true but it that's part of the process and it's exactly the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:18">1:10:18-1:10:23</a>:</strong>  process i've been through it's like it just to find someone who can do that it's like it's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:23">1:10:23-1:10:29</a>:</strong>  the sort of thing i just want to pay someone to help me with it's got to be someone with real<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:29">1:10:29-1:10:36</a>:</strong>  skin in the game in my game you know and so it's it's hard to it's not something you could contrive<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:36">1:10:36-1:10:43</a>:</strong>  it's something that has to happen naturally but it's a cool process to to to see how that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:43">1:10:43-1:10:49</a>:</strong>  unfolded i've been really wanting that for some years but it's really happening in in a natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:49">1:10:49-1:10:56</a>:</strong>  way that feels like it's going to bring a lot of benefit to to me to my collaborator and to a whole<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:10:56">1:10:56-1:11:02</a>:</strong>  network of people so we'll see how that i'm super excited about it personally i do you have any<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:02">1:11:02-1:11:10</a>:</strong>  dates that you can say yet or is it still a little undefined we're hoping to launch the like we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:10">1:11:10-1:11:16</a>:</strong>  rebuilding websites so everything we do online and it's culminating at the end of the year with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:17">1:11:17-1:11:24</a>:</strong>  launching a few different online training options and it's all totally being redone and put on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:24">1:11:24-1:11:30</a>:</strong>  a different platform and a lot more content added but the farm like a hero tour will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:31">1:11:31-1:11:39</a>:</strong>  i basically had the the physical trip was divided up into sections starting 18th of april<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:39">1:11:39-1:11:46</a>:</strong>  so and that was to go to spain and south of france and portugal before coming back here to host joel<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:46">1:11:46-1:11:52</a>:</strong>  salatin for our master class at the farm so i'm basically canceling that bit of the trip for now<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:11:53">1:11:53-1:12:00</a>:</strong>  and we've had to reschedule joel to the autumn here hoping that can go ahead in the autumn<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:00">1:12:00-1:12:10</a>:</strong>  so i was basically planning to take some of the later dates and move them to the front and start<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:11">1:12:11-1:12:18</a>:</strong>  offering twice weekly long form uh interviews from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:18">1:12:18-1:12:28</a>:</strong>  well it'll be about we're hoping to launch in a month's time basically okay so first of may and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:28">1:12:28-1:12:32</a>:</strong>  and what that would allow me to do the fiddling that's been going on the background because it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:32">1:12:32-1:12:39</a>:</strong>  obviously been a mammoth task just organizing a route around europe and getting everyone to dates<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:39">1:12:39-1:12:45</a>:</strong>  where i would show up so it's been a massive planning work that now i'm going to be doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:45">1:12:45-1:12:51</a>:</strong>  a massive planning work that now i'm trying to work off the back of that and keep the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:52">1:12:52-1:12:58</a>:</strong>  as many of those dates as possible so that i can say right obviously i'm not coming to visit you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:12:58">1:12:58-1:13:04</a>:</strong>  but let's talk this day and then please if you want to be included in this book<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:05">1:13:05-1:13:12</a>:</strong>  here's a task for you to do for the rest of the day because they've already slotted slotted it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:12">1:13:12-1:13:17</a>:</strong>  out for me to be here i'm really excited about that i think definitely you know having interviews<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:17">1:13:17-1:13:22</a>:</strong>  is going to be less rewarding than filming farms but i think that's where the book could be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:23">1:13:23-1:13:27</a>:</strong>  really backing that up because i think the conversations will go in different directions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:27">1:13:27-1:13:32</a>:</strong>  naturally whereas the book will be you know a formula that's the same that allows people to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:32">1:13:32-1:13:38</a>:</strong>  compare many different places across different countries and yeah yeah yeah i'm super excited for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:38">1:13:38-1:13:42</a>:</strong>  it well you definitely count me and i'm really looking forward to this coming out and understanding<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:43">1:13:43-1:13:48</a>:</strong>  the the context of my area even better and hopefully linking up with other people doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:48">1:13:48-1:13:54</a>:</strong>  regenerative farming in this area of spain and then southern europe in general um yeah i can't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:13:54">1:13:54-1:14:00</a>:</strong>  wait uh now one last question before you go now that you've reached this level of development with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:00">1:14:00-1:14:06</a>:</strong>  your farm what are some of the key goals that you have for the coming years is there are any major<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:06">1:14:06-1:14:17</a>:</strong>  goals that you're still kind of looking to achieve yeah our main goals focus around balance like time<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:17">1:14:17-1:14:28</a>:</strong>  family balance work life balance and it there was certainly some years of just keeping scaling up<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:28">1:14:28-1:14:34</a>:</strong>  and wanting to push that and push that and i really let go of that finally where like i always had a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:34">1:14:34-1:14:41</a>:</strong>  dream to see how much can be done on this space and just push it to the maximum but we don't need<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:41">1:14:41-1:14:46</a>:</strong>  to do that it's like we don't need to do a lot of things that we do we've been doing them for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:46">1:14:46-1:14:52</a>:</strong>  other people's benefit it's like we have all our food we don't have debt we earn enough money it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:14:52">1:14:52-1:15:01</a>:</strong>  like it we don't need any more so that was kind of like a a big realization a year and a half two<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:01">1:15:01-1:15:08</a>:</strong>  years ago so like now we don't need to do this like it it will benefit some people but at what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:08">1:15:08-1:15:14</a>:</strong>  cost you know if it's costing us our health it's not worth it so our real our goal now is just to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:14">1:15:14-1:15:22</a>:</strong>  sit back and enjoy it more and take some of the stress away and and the big part for us with that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:22">1:15:22-1:15:28</a>:</strong>  is is bringing in longer-term people that's been the biggest challenge here is that it's amazing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:28">1:15:28-1:15:33</a>:</strong>  the opportunities we've been able to give people but we are literally starting with new people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:33">1:15:33-1:15:39</a>:</strong>  we've always tried to have at least one person who's done a season here the next year it's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:39">1:15:39-1:15:44</a>:</strong>  always possible because the people that are really good and naturally the people that go off and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:44">1:15:44-1:15:52</a>:</strong>  start their own thing you know so it's very hard to get the best people to stay and it's also a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:52">1:15:52-1:15:58</a>:</strong>  big i i had a few years ago i asked some of the best people that have been here to join the actual<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:15:58">1:15:58-1:16:04</a>:</strong>  business and give them you know an opportunity that i doubt they would ever get offered again but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:04">1:16:04-1:16:11</a>:</strong>  it's a big ask because i'm asking them to come and plant roots in the middle of nowhere in sweden<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:11">1:16:11-1:16:18</a>:</strong>  and they're typically not swedish people but now over this winter we've started to work with<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:18">1:16:18-1:16:28</a>:</strong>  local young families and there are several people who we foresee could be you know longer term in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:28">1:16:28-1:16:35</a>:</strong>  place so that we because the actual work we do is fairly easeful you know you need four people to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:35">1:16:35-1:16:43</a>:</strong>  run this farm at full production and that will pay them a white collar salary but you then get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:43">1:16:43-1:16:52</a>:</strong>  then get four or five months off and it's quite easeful if we if we didn't have to train people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:52">1:16:52-1:16:59</a>:</strong>  from scratch it would just get easier and easier and easier so that's what we're dreaming about is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:16:59">1:16:59-1:17:06</a>:</strong>  just having the you know like every year you forget you forget like you know people coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:06">1:17:06-1:17:13</a>:</strong>  that just like it blows your mind like people haven't they it's very hard to judge online even<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:13">1:17:13-1:17:20</a>:</strong>  talking to people on face to face on skype or whatever you know people say all kinds of things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:20">1:17:20-1:17:27</a>:</strong>  i've had people at the chainsaw certified teaching people to sculpt bits of wood that they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:27">1:17:27-1:17:34</a>:</strong>  standing on with sandals you know and people that have just come out of buddha feeding chickens<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:34">1:17:34-1:17:41</a>:</strong>  handling chicken shit who have not washed their hands and started like handling salad for 30<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:41">1:17:41-1:17:48</a>:</strong>  people with you know it's like stuff that just blows your mind because it's like uh hello but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:48">1:17:48-1:17:54</a>:</strong>  it happens every year it's like people need nanny and if you don't come from this life you just don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:17:54">1:17:54-1:18:01</a>:</strong>  necessarily think straight you know yeah and so our biggest dream however silly it sounds is to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:01">1:18:01-1:18:09</a>:</strong>  like just not have to do any of that hand holding and just work with a few people who you know who<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:09">1:18:09-1:18:16</a>:</strong>  just know how to do their thing and that's our biggest goal and just watch the ecosystem develop<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:16">1:18:16-1:18:22</a>:</strong>  i mean it's been amazing just seeing how many species have moved into our farm and the resilience<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:22">1:18:22-1:18:27</a>:</strong>  the droughts a couple years ago accelerated trajectory that's incredible and it's really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:27">1:18:27-1:18:31</a>:</strong>  interesting to hear like with this level advancement because i mean for most people<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:31">1:18:31-1:18:37</a>:</strong>  what is it now seven years into farming would not be anywhere near the level where they could start<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:37">1:18:37-1:18:43</a>:</strong>  to coast or start worrying about the the development things that you just talked about but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:43">1:18:43-1:18:49</a>:</strong>  it just goes to show how like you know it it must have been an absolutely herculean feat to get all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:49">1:18:49-1:18:53</a>:</strong>  of these things off the ground while running educational programs i mean i've done half of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:18:53">1:18:53-1:19:00</a>:</strong>  those things and burned out because of poor planning i'm not afraid to admit and and to see<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:00">1:19:00-1:19:07</a>:</strong>  that like it's gotten to this point so quickly is is really interesting to watch yeah it's cool<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:07">1:19:07-1:19:14</a>:</strong>  but it is as i said it you know i really have put in 15 work years it's not come without cast i've<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:14">1:19:14-1:19:23</a>:</strong>  got gray hairs and wrinkles that i shouldn't have genetically right now and i yeah i don't want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:23">1:19:23-1:19:30</a>:</strong>  do that anymore but i did want to do that before you know like i was burning up it was i the only<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:30">1:19:30-1:19:37</a>:</strong>  way i can explain that is like something moving through me you know it wasn't decisions i made i<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:37">1:19:37-1:19:43</a>:</strong>  just woke up every day pumped to go but i don't i've been quite clear with people i don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:43">1:19:43-1:19:49</a>:</strong>  necessarily recommend trying to do things so fast like i am i have put a lot of energy into planning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:49">1:19:49-1:19:56</a>:</strong>  and also came to it with a lot of experience that's you know i had planned a lot of properties<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:19:56">1:19:56-1:20:02</a>:</strong>  so i'm i was very confident what i was doing and it's just fun i think i posted on facebook just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:02">1:20:02-1:20:07</a>:</strong>  a couple of weeks ago one of these things popped up to remind you and it was a photo of me<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:09">1:20:09-1:20:18</a>:</strong>  in thailand it was where i met matt who was a significant person here and i just drew<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:18">1:20:18-1:20:23</a>:</strong>  the design of the farm i hadn't even i'd spent two hours on the farm under snow and i just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:23">1:20:23-1:20:29</a>:</strong>  remember explaining what i was going to do when i got home and it was that spring i came back from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:29">1:20:29-1:20:36</a>:</strong>  southeast asia that we started and just funny seeing that photo and seeing like every single<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:36">1:20:36-1:20:43</a>:</strong>  thing we plan to do has come to pass and a few things even quicker but it's from just a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:43">1:20:43-1:20:50</a>:</strong>  planning and it's a joyful process a lot of people don't put enough time into the the planning and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:50">1:20:50-1:20:56</a>:</strong>  number crunching because quite frankly it's pretty mind-boggling and there's better things to do but<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:20:56">1:20:56-1:21:04</a>:</strong>  it's it's like um i can't think of a good analogy but like spreadsheets like most people turn their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:04">1:21:04-1:21:11</a>:</strong>  heads when you know roll their eyes when they see that but but the people are gonna succeed get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:11">1:21:11-1:21:17</a>:</strong>  excited by that because when you're in control of those numbers and when you're in control of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:17">1:21:17-1:21:26</a>:</strong>  overall plan and time flow it gives you a calm confidence and the sureness of what you're doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:26">1:21:26-1:21:32</a>:</strong>  and that's really important well it directs you of the priority of when to take certain actions<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:32">1:21:32-1:21:40</a>:</strong>  and what needs to be prioritized and yeah that's a big part of what we try and do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:40">1:21:40-1:21:47</a>:</strong>  what we try and really like show people a window into when they're here but i don't recommend<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:47">1:21:47-1:21:52</a>:</strong>  people try so much at once it's definitely been stressful at times because of that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:21:55">1:21:55-1:22:00</a>:</strong>  well look rigid that's a really good place to kind of transition over could you tell us a little bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:00">1:22:00-1:22:05</a>:</strong>  about well for the the sake of our listeners where they can find all of your information<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:12">1:22:12-1:22:18</a>:</strong>  yeah well i guess like most stuff comes out on our youtube channel so you can look up<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:24">1:22:24-1:22:30</a>:</strong>  it's not the most organized of youtube channels but it's extremely content rich if you put the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/richard-perkins/#t=1:22:30">1:22:30-1:22:39</a>:</strong>  time into it and on our facebook page at ridgedale permaculture so basically all things that i update<br />
