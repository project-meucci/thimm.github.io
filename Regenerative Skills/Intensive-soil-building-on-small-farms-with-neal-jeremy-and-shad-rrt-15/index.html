<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:50">0:02:50-0:02:55</a>:</strong>  And we're wrapping up a month of focus on building soil for market gardening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:02:55">0:02:55-0:03:01</a>:</strong>  And seen as that's the primary operation for both of these farms that that these guys have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:01">0:03:01-0:03:02</a>:</strong>  developed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:02">0:03:02-0:03:07</a>:</strong>  Let's go around and start talking a little bit about, first of all, how you build soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:07">0:03:07-0:03:12</a>:</strong>  to create as much fertility on what is otherwise fairly marginal land.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:12">0:03:12-0:03:15</a>:</strong>  So Chad, Chad, why don't you start us off?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:15">0:03:15-0:03:19</a>:</strong>  I know that you have a unique system because you produce a lot with your chickens, both<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:19">0:03:19-0:03:22</a>:</strong>  as meat products and for eggs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:22">0:03:22-0:03:27</a>:</strong>  And you found an ingenious way of composting a lot of the organic matter that you put into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:27">0:03:27-0:03:33</a>:</strong>  the pens, as well as the nitrogen rich manure from the chickens, primarily for the production<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:33">0:03:33-0:03:34</a>:</strong>  of salad greens on your farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:34">0:03:34-0:03:36</a>:</strong>  Could you elaborate a little bit about that system?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:36">0:03:36-0:03:37</a>:</strong>  Yeah, sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:37">0:03:37-0:03:38</a>:</strong>  Thanks, Oliver.<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:41">0:03:41-0:03:46</a>:</strong>  So you mentioned the chickens and the topic is more market gardens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:46">0:03:46-0:03:51</a>:</strong>  We maintain two different breeds of chicken on the Ati'Lad organics farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:51">0:03:51-0:03:57</a>:</strong>  So we have the meat birds, which are the Cornish cross, the traditional typical meat bird.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:03:57">0:03:57-0:04:02</a>:</strong>  They live pretty much exclusively outside, mainly in the food forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:02">0:04:02-0:04:05</a>:</strong>  So they're very rarely working in the market garden.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:05">0:04:05-0:04:13</a>:</strong>  We do get some kind of, I would say it's quite anaerobic kind of compacted compost from their<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:13">0:04:13-0:04:15</a>:</strong>  house, but they're only there at night.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:15">0:04:15-0:04:18</a>:</strong>  We just bed it down every day with hay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:18">0:04:18-0:04:22</a>:</strong>  Most of the time, the majority of their manure is just cycled through the food forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:22">0:04:22-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  But the hens are a different breed of chicken.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  It's a leg horn cross, more suited for tropical environments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:30">0:04:30-0:04:35</a>:</strong>  And so we use them pretty much exclusively to fuel the salad fertility, which is our<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:35">0:04:35-0:04:38</a>:</strong>  main product on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:38">0:04:38-0:04:42</a>:</strong>  We do let our hens out sometimes into vegetable areas or food forest.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:42">0:04:42-0:04:47</a>:</strong>  We really designed both of our main hen houses, which are each designed to hold a hundred<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:04:48</a>:</strong>  hens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:48">0:04:48-0:04:50</a>:</strong>  So it's 200 total spread across two houses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:50">0:04:50-0:04:57</a>:</strong>  The houses respect the various parameters so that under the chickens, a deep hot compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:04:57">0:04:57-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  pile can just naturally occur and be maintained mostly by the hens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:02">0:05:02-0:05:09</a>:</strong>  And those parameters are things like five square feet per hen and a minimum of three<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:09">0:05:09-0:05:13</a>:</strong>  feet of deep organic matter in the compost pile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:13">0:05:13-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  And when you have that depth of material, the bottom most layer is pretty much always<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:19">0:05:19-0:05:20</a>:</strong>  finished compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:20">0:05:20-0:05:25</a>:</strong>  So when we turn a salad bed, we pull the remaining plants out, feed them to the chickens, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:25">0:05:25-0:05:29</a>:</strong>  then dig the third layer down in their deep compost bedding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:29">0:05:29-0:05:35</a>:</strong>  And that's ready made compost to add to the salad bed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:35">0:05:35-0:05:40</a>:</strong>  Have you found any difficulties in this system or ways that you can improve the efficiency<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:40">0:05:40-0:05:43</a>:</strong>  of it over the amount of time that you've been trying this out?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:43">0:05:43-0:05:49</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so this is definitely, so for anyone interested, all of these plans and details<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:49">0:05:49-0:05:56</a>:</strong>  are outlined in our composting chickens comic book, which is available for five bucks on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:56">0:05:56-0:05:58</a>:</strong>  the Permies marketplace and on Amazon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:05:58">0:05:58-0:06:04</a>:</strong>  So if you look up Ativan Organics composting chickens, you can get the 30 page super hip,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:04">0:06:04-0:06:08</a>:</strong>  super sweet comic book, which has all this information and more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:08">0:06:08-0:06:12</a>:</strong>  But yeah, to give you guys a glimpse and some of the things I've learned through processing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:12">0:06:12-0:06:15</a>:</strong>  and since publishing that comic book.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:15">0:06:15-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  So it's scale neutral.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:22</a>:</strong>  So you can have five hens, you can have 50 hens, you can have 100 hens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:22">0:06:22-0:06:28</a>:</strong>  A natural size limit of hen flocks kind of in nature is about 200, 250.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:28">0:06:28-0:06:32</a>:</strong>  So not recommend building a house that accommodates more than 200 hens, you're better off breaking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:32">0:06:32-0:06:33</a>:</strong>  them into two.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:33">0:06:33-0:06:37</a>:</strong>  So if you have five hens, as long as you respect that space perimeter of five square foot per<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:37">0:06:37-0:06:41</a>:</strong>  hen, you think in meters, it's two hens per square meter.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:48</a>:</strong>  Then with five hens, you can basically have a deep compost pile and have eggs and everything<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:48">0:06:48-0:06:50</a>:</strong>  I talked about is similar with 50.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:50">0:06:50-0:06:55</a>:</strong>  There'll be different advantages to various designs depending on how many chickens you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:55">0:06:55-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:00</a>:</strong>  For people, I've seen houses built with 10 or 15 chickens and they have these kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:00">0:07:00-0:07:01</a>:</strong>  like trap doors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:01">0:07:01-0:07:07</a>:</strong>  So the walls on the side of the chicken houses, the wall at the bottom say 50 centimeters<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:07">0:07:07-0:07:14</a>:</strong>  or two feet is a swing door so that you can reach in from the outside and more easily<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:14">0:07:14-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  harvest the compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:17</a>:</strong>  That works really nice for smaller houses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:17">0:07:17-0:07:19</a>:</strong>  Ours are slightly too large for that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:19">0:07:19-0:07:25</a>:</strong>  We found that keeping them watered, not sopping wet, but irrigating them as if it was a garden<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:25">0:07:25-0:07:31</a>:</strong>  bed, that compost pile really helps accelerate the breakdown and also just kind of like digging<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:31">0:07:31-0:07:34</a>:</strong>  random holes in there as part of our chicken maintenance is just going into the house in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:34">0:07:34-0:07:39</a>:</strong>  the morning, picking a hole, picking a corner or a space where we haven't done this in a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:39">0:07:39-0:07:40</a>:</strong>  little while and dig a hole there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:40">0:07:40-0:07:43</a>:</strong>  And then they come in and dig down that bottom part.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:43">0:07:43-0:07:47</a>:</strong>  I could talk for more, we've tried to integrate other animals into it, hanging rabbit cages<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:47">0:07:47-0:07:53</a>:</strong>  above the chickens also help fuel that compost pile with their urine, with the poop and the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:53">0:07:53-0:07:55</a>:</strong>  greens that they've made dirty but don't eat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:55">0:07:55-0:07:57</a>:</strong>  We've tried pigs in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:07:57">0:07:57-0:08:02</a>:</strong>  That works really well until the pigs start eating the chickens and there's a lot of other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:02">0:08:02-0:08:10</a>:</strong>  kind of design potential with that basic idea of keeping your hands on a compost pile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:10">0:08:10-0:08:15</a>:</strong>  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense and I like how you mentioned that it can be facilitated by<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:15">0:08:15-0:08:20</a>:</strong>  watering the beds because what I've seen in both your application and in other places,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:20">0:08:20-0:08:24</a>:</strong>  because it gets so hot at those lower layers, it actually evaporates off a lot of the moisture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:24">0:08:24-0:08:31</a>:</strong>  and you want to kind of maintain that balance for ideal decomposition.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:31">0:08:31-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  Now Neil, you and Jeremy have developed a fantastic multi-tiered system on Granja's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  Siqin site with multiple animals contributing to the composting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:47</a>:</strong>  Can you tell us a little bit about how those animals work in synergy, not just to create<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:47">0:08:47-0:08:52</a>:</strong>  compost but also for the cleanliness of the pen?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:52">0:08:52-0:08:53</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:53">0:08:53-0:08:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah, the animals we work with are goats and chickens mainly and then we also have some<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:08:59">0:08:59-0:09:05</a>:</strong>  ducks that have been really surprisingly prolific because we've just actually given a present<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:05">0:09:05-0:09:06</a>:</strong>  of some ducks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:06">0:09:06-0:09:10</a>:</strong>  But they've kind of found their way into that system and they're doing well in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:10">0:09:10-0:09:16</a>:</strong>  But really it works, I think, mostly because of the goat house, placing the chicken house<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:16">0:09:16-0:09:18</a>:</strong>  below the goat house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:18">0:09:18-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  It's like an idea really that I got from Shad, one of the things I like about the way Shad<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:32</a>:</strong>  teaches is there's like mantras for every kind of subject that I think are really important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:32">0:09:32-0:09:37</a>:</strong>  One of the mantras for the animal system is this like natural process where omnivores<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:37">0:09:37-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  follow herbivores.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  And I guess like in a larger farm, which we don't have, where we had pasture, we would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:45">0:09:45-0:09:54</a>:</strong>  probably do goats in a section of the pasture being moved on a daily basis and being followed<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:54">0:09:54-0:09:55</a>:</strong>  by chickens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:55">0:09:55-0:09:56</a>:</strong>  That's kind of how that would work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:09:56">0:09:56-0:10:00</a>:</strong>  But because we don't have that type of farm, as you said, we kind of have marginal land<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:00">0:10:00-0:10:02</a>:</strong>  and not a huge amount of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:02">0:10:02-0:10:06</a>:</strong>  It was easier to do stationary houses where we take the goats out to walk and then the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:06">0:10:06-0:10:13</a>:</strong>  chicken house is really just kind of like a rip off of Shad's deep bedding chicken house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:13">0:10:13-0:10:14</a>:</strong>  An elaboration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:14">0:10:14-0:10:16</a>:</strong>  There we go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:16">0:10:16-0:10:18</a>:</strong>  For copyright reasons.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:18">0:10:18-0:10:24</a>:</strong>  It works on like, it's essentially two terraces.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:24">0:10:24-0:10:25</a>:</strong>  The thing is built on a slope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:25">0:10:25-0:10:30</a>:</strong>  So it's a goat house and then two levels of the chicken house below that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:30">0:10:30-0:10:35</a>:</strong>  And really what we do is instead of turning compost piles, we just successively move it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:35">0:10:35-0:10:36</a>:</strong>  down through levels.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:36">0:10:36-0:10:40</a>:</strong>  So we clean out the goat house about every three or four weeks and it goes on to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:40">0:10:40-0:10:44</a>:</strong>  first level of the chicken house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:44">0:10:44-0:10:47</a>:</strong>  And the goat manure is quite anaerobic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:47">0:10:47-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  I think goat manure is like really, really high quality because goats are browsers and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:10:55</a>:</strong>  they have very high mineral requirements.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:10:55">0:10:55-0:11:00</a>:</strong>  And so they eat a lot of these like mineral dense plants and then poop it out of the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:00">0:11:00-0:11:03</a>:</strong>  But they really do compact the manure and you see it when you clean up the house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:03">0:11:03-0:11:08</a>:</strong>  It's like not, it would not be suitable for putting straight onto your garden, but the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:08">0:11:08-0:11:09</a>:</strong>  chickens love it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:09">0:11:09-0:11:13</a>:</strong>  And the way we've designed the house is that chickens can get in there kind of pretty much<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:13">0:11:13-0:11:15</a>:</strong>  any time during the day, which does work nicely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:15">0:11:15-0:11:20</a>:</strong>  They kind of go in and the often will just even like sit on the back of the goat and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:20">0:11:20-0:11:22</a>:</strong>  pick, pick bugs off them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:27</a>:</strong>  But they also scratch around a lot and eat the little bugs that start developing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:27">0:11:27-0:11:28</a>:</strong>  goat manure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:28">0:11:28-0:11:33</a>:</strong>  But yeah, then we open the door once every two or four weeks, put the goat house down<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:33">0:11:33-0:11:37</a>:</strong>  into the first level of the chicken house, then the first level of the chicken house<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:37">0:11:37-0:11:39</a>:</strong>  down into the second level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:39">0:11:39-0:11:43</a>:</strong>  And then we eventually have a door down at the bottom of the chicken house where we throw<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:43">0:11:43-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  the piles out and we make like hot piles that we turn one or two more times.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:11:50</a>:</strong>  And it works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:50">0:11:50-0:11:56</a>:</strong>  The compost pile is especially towards the end of the process, even within the chicken<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:56">0:11:56-0:11:59</a>:</strong>  house, it's just like Chad says, if you dig down, it gets really hot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:11:59">0:11:59-0:12:05</a>:</strong>  But then we find that when we make up the big piles, it really does start to cook down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:05">0:12:05-0:12:10</a>:</strong>  We cover them with plastic at that stage, which is ideal for us because that means we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:10">0:12:10-0:12:11</a>:</strong>  don't have to keep watering.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:11">0:12:11-0:12:17</a>:</strong>  As you mentioned, Oliver, the inside of the pile and it's really hard such to just evaporate<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:17">0:12:17-0:12:19</a>:</strong>  all the water and can get dry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:19">0:12:19-0:12:24</a>:</strong>  But if you have the plastic over it, it almost distills and rains back down into it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:24">0:12:24-0:12:28</a>:</strong>  And so, it kind of creates this sort of like interior hydrologic cycle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:28">0:12:28-0:12:31</a>:</strong>  Sounds really fancy but just kind of like cover it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:31">0:12:31-0:12:36</a>:</strong>  It helped actually a lot with the quality from a kind of a qualitative point of view<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:36">0:12:36-0:12:41</a>:</strong>  and quantitative actually was during coffee season, like building the coffee production<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:41">0:12:41-0:12:48</a>:</strong>  facilities and depulping sort of five to 10 hundred pound sacks of coffee every day from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:48">0:12:48-0:12:51</a>:</strong>  the community.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:51">0:12:51-0:12:56</a>:</strong>  A lot of that we had planned and just putting it to one side and using it for lumber compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:12:56">0:12:56-0:13:02</a>:</strong>  But what we actually found over time is it was easier to take kind of well up to slightly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:02">0:13:02-0:13:07</a>:</strong>  over half of it and just put it down into the first level of that chicken house as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:07">0:13:07-0:13:13</a>:</strong>  And the moisture that that has, we noticed the compost really broke down and was improved<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:13">0:13:13-0:13:15</a>:</strong>  by the addition of that material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:15">0:13:15-0:13:18</a>:</strong>  So, yeah, that's another.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:18">0:13:18-0:13:23</a>:</strong>  Have you found that in both cases that at least to a certain degree, the feed costs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:23">0:13:23-0:13:28</a>:</strong>  for the chickens is reduced because they're actually eating a lot of bugs or what they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:28">0:13:28-0:13:32</a>:</strong>  call bitchos or little parasites that otherwise live, especially in the case of the goats<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:32">0:13:32-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  in the manure or even around the goats directly?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:42</a>:</strong>  And has it made a significant difference in the nutrition levels and the variety of diet<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:42">0:13:42-0:13:44</a>:</strong>  for the animals?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:44">0:13:44-0:13:46</a>:</strong>  Yeah, okay.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:46">0:13:46-0:13:52</a>:</strong>  I was just kind of starting to do the math in my head and I haven't finished.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:52">0:13:52-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so kind of recommended for our hens, for example, the breed of hen that we work<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:06</a>:</strong>  with, the recommended kind of feed per hen is about a quarter pound a day, possibly a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:06">0:14:06-0:14:07</a>:</strong>  bit more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:07">0:14:07-0:14:08</a>:</strong>  And this is concentrated feed?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:08">0:14:08-0:14:12</a>:</strong>  That would be like the industrial recommendation, basically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:12">0:14:12-0:14:16</a>:</strong>  Concentrated feed, no other feed source, just that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:16">0:14:16-0:14:19</a>:</strong>  A quarter to a third of a pound a day per hen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:19">0:14:19-0:14:22</a>:</strong>  So four hens would eat a pound.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:22">0:14:22-0:14:28</a>:</strong>  And I know it's like at least six of our hens eat a pound, possibly more than six will get<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:28">0:14:28-0:14:29</a>:</strong>  a pound.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:29">0:14:29-0:14:30</a>:</strong>  I would have to give you the number exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:30">0:14:30-0:14:38</a>:</strong>  But I'd say we see at least like a 50% reduction in the amount of store bought feed or non-farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:38">0:14:38-0:14:46</a>:</strong>  grown feed by using the kitchen scraps and the hot compost pile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:46">0:14:46-0:14:47</a>:</strong>  For sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:47">0:14:47-0:14:55</a>:</strong>  And now we all know that the quantity of nitrogen, especially in droppings from chickens and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:55">0:14:55-0:14:59</a>:</strong>  certainly the urine from other animals is very significant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:14:59">0:14:59-0:15:06</a>:</strong>  And it can be tough to kind of balance out the carbon to nitrogen ratio that would make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:06">0:15:06-0:15:08</a>:</strong>  ideal compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:08">0:15:08-0:15:15</a>:</strong>  And I know that we mostly started out using straw that was imported from the coast as<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:15">0:15:15-0:15:19</a>:</strong>  the primary source of carbon in these systems, but we've been playing around with different<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:19">0:15:19-0:15:28</a>:</strong>  sources as well in an effort to try and, I guess, wean ourselves off of inputs from outside<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:28">0:15:28-0:15:32</a>:</strong>  and try and bring as much carbon from the community rather than relying on outside sources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:32">0:15:32-0:15:38</a>:</strong>  Have you found any success with using leaf litter or other forms of carbon that are more<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:38">0:15:38-0:15:42</a>:</strong>  readily available in the local area?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:42">0:15:42-0:15:46</a>:</strong>  I'll also talk on that one quickly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:46">0:15:46-0:15:50</a>:</strong>  A few comments on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:50">0:15:50-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  Here in Guatemala, where we are in the highlands of Sololah, there's less infrastructure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  So it would be different if you're in a place where there's roads and municipalities that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:05</a>:</strong>  maintain like public areas and there's tree trimmers and things like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:05">0:16:05-0:16:09</a>:</strong>  You pretty much get loads of that stuff pretty easily.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:09">0:16:09-0:16:13</a>:</strong>  Here in our particular situation, organic matter is more difficult to come by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:13">0:16:13-0:16:18</a>:</strong>  I'm not at all interested in weaning myself off straw that I buy from the coast.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:18">0:16:18-0:16:19</a>:</strong>  I want to buy more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:19">0:16:19-0:16:25</a>:</strong>  I would like to be able to have the farm afford to buy three times or four times the amount<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:25">0:16:25-0:16:27</a>:</strong>  we're currently buying every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:27">0:16:27-0:16:33</a>:</strong>  Just to be clear, I think there's a lot of systems in nature that use, like, there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:33">0:16:33-0:16:37</a>:</strong>  no such thing as a closed system in nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:37">0:16:37-0:16:38</a>:</strong>  The earth itself isn't even closed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:38">0:16:38-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  I read the other day, 85 million pounds of cosmic dust lands and settles on the earth<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:16:48</a>:</strong>  every year.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:48">0:16:48-0:16:52</a>:</strong>  So the earth is getting heavier by 85 million pounds of cosmic dust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:52">0:16:52-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  How crazy is that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  There's no such thing as a closed system in nature.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:17:01</a>:</strong>  And actually what a lot of systems in nature have is you have these intensive focal points<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:01">0:17:01-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  that consume and then lots of broader scape that tend to provide for the consumption in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:09</a>:</strong>  more densely focused areas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:09">0:17:09-0:17:13</a>:</strong>  You see it in a cell with the mitochondria and the nucleus.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:13">0:17:13-0:17:19</a>:</strong>  Majority of the cell is there to promote the nucleus's growth in there and that functionality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:19">0:17:19-0:17:24</a>:</strong>  I see this bringing in hay and bringing in carbon as the mitochondria for the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:24">0:17:24-0:17:29</a>:</strong>  And I'll take that from anywhere as long as it's like a sustainable source that's coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:29">0:17:29-0:17:30</a>:</strong>  from it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:30">0:17:30-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  There's some other stuff, but yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:33">0:17:33-0:17:34</a>:</strong>  What about you guys?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:34">0:17:34-0:17:37</a>:</strong>  Because, you know, maybe you're not trying to wean off of it directly, but I know that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:37">0:17:37-0:17:41</a>:</strong>  we've experimented with other forms of carbon on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:41">0:17:41-0:17:46</a>:</strong>  Have you found any advantages or disadvantages from the sources that we have closer around<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:46">0:17:46-0:17:49</a>:</strong>  in the local community?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:49">0:17:49-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  Yeah, we do find some other materials that are quite close by.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:54">0:17:54-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  Sometimes we'll have neighbors that will be cleaning out what they call brossa or like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:04</a>:</strong>  this sort of forest mulch on the bottoms of their coffee growing areas because they do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:04">0:18:04-0:18:09</a>:</strong>  weeding and they clean this stuff out oftentimes and they're looking to, they know it's a great<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:09">0:18:09-0:18:12</a>:</strong>  source of carbon and it's not just carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:12">0:18:12-0:18:18</a>:</strong>  It's got a lot of interesting sort of microbial growth in it from the forest, which gives<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:18">0:18:18-0:18:25</a>:</strong>  it a nice potential in that way to diversify the soil communities that you're working with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:25">0:18:25-0:18:29</a>:</strong>  So it has that benefit to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:29">0:18:29-0:18:34</a>:</strong>  I agree with Shad, the straw is a beautiful resource.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:34">0:18:34-0:18:37</a>:</strong>  It stays a bit more aerobic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:37">0:18:37-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  It doesn't get compacted as easily.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:18:42</a>:</strong>  So it definitely creates a healthier compost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:42">0:18:42-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  In some ways the leaves get packed down almost immediately.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  Sawdust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  Oh sure, because of the air pockets in the straw.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:18:48</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:18:53</a>:</strong>  And it insulates the pile, which is really, really helpful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:53">0:18:53-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  And I also agree that I don't see it being a serious problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:19:01</a>:</strong>  It doesn't create too much of a cost issue.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:01">0:19:01-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  It's pretty, it's not the most expensive thing to pull in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:12</a>:</strong>  And I guess the only thing I would look for is maybe a more nutrient rich straw if possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:12">0:19:12-0:19:18</a>:</strong>  That's the stuff that we get, the goats aren't super excited about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:18">0:19:18-0:19:22</a>:</strong>  Maybe like barley, if there's barley production somewhere getting the stocks off of that would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:22">0:19:22-0:19:23</a>:</strong>  be a great one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:23">0:19:23-0:19:27</a>:</strong>  And something you can feed for the, especially in dry season, something like that would be<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:27">0:19:27-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:32</a>:</strong>  So we've talked now a lot about the base of the systems and the fundamentals of how they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:32">0:19:32-0:19:33</a>:</strong>  work.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:33">0:19:33-0:19:39</a>:</strong>  But I know that in both cases on both farms you've made efforts to improve the process<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:39">0:19:39-0:19:40</a>:</strong>  with a few other inputs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:40">0:19:40-0:19:42</a>:</strong>  So let's talk first about EM's.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:42">0:19:42-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  Who wants to explain a little bit about what EM's are, how you brew them, and some of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:19:51</a>:</strong>  ways that you've used them to accelerate the compost and improve the quality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:51">0:19:51-0:19:53</a>:</strong>  Neil, you want to start with that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:53">0:19:53-0:19:55</a>:</strong>  Sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:19:55">0:19:55-0:20:01</a>:</strong>  To be honest, I don't really fully understand this stuff that well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:01">0:20:01-0:20:09</a>:</strong>  You know, my EM's were talking about effective microorganisms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:09">0:20:09-0:20:16</a>:</strong>  I read a little bit about this stuff and I have a friend who's a distributor of what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:16">0:20:16-0:20:17</a>:</strong>  they call it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:17">0:20:17-0:20:18</a>:</strong>  Like inoculant?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:18">0:20:18-0:20:19</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:19">0:20:19-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  Like he sells basically, I think laboratory prepared solutions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:29</a>:</strong>  And they're kind of like kombucha starters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:29">0:20:29-0:20:35</a>:</strong>  You put them in a plastic container and you do a lactoform and you add food source and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:35">0:20:35-0:20:37</a>:</strong>  you dilute them down and they proliferate.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:37">0:20:37-0:20:47</a>:</strong>  As I understand it, it's a kind of a patented product that has the right mix of symbiotic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:47">0:20:47-0:20:55</a>:</strong>  bacteria that work, yeah, that work symbiotically in your soil to eliminate pathogens, to break<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:20:55">0:20:55-0:21:01</a>:</strong>  down organic material in a kind of an optimal way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:01">0:21:01-0:21:07</a>:</strong>  I definitely think that EM's and bacteria and compost teas in general are not, they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:07">0:21:07-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  no substitute for carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:15</a>:</strong>  I think they're almost like icing on the cake a little bit, but there's no substitute for<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:15">0:21:15-0:21:20</a>:</strong>  like just raw large amounts of organic, broken down organic material.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:20">0:21:20-0:21:27</a>:</strong>  And honestly what I do is this friend of mine, he gave me, kind of gave me a present of like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:27">0:21:27-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  a starter kit for these EM's and I started them in a drum probably about a year ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:40</a>:</strong>  And then I was smelling it and I was just like, just like kombucha is what it smells<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:40">0:21:40-0:21:41</a>:</strong>  like.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:41">0:21:41-0:21:42</a>:</strong>  Or sauerkraut or something or whatever.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:42">0:21:42-0:21:46</a>:</strong>  And it gets like this white scum layer on the top that anyone who's done any home fermenting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:46">0:21:46-0:21:47</a>:</strong>  will do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:47">0:21:47-0:21:52</a>:</strong>  And I started to kind of be like, there's no way, you know, it's not really, I'm not<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:52">0:21:52-0:21:58</a>:</strong>  the type of person I guess who likes to buy things that come in a shiny plastic container.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:21:58">0:21:58-0:22:00</a>:</strong>  Especially not if you can make them yourself, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:00">0:22:00-0:22:06</a>:</strong>  And I don't know if I can, but anyway, what I started doing, what I started doing, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:06">0:22:06-0:22:10</a>:</strong>  this is maybe some listener will be kind enough to write in and tell me how wrong I am about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:10">0:22:10-0:22:12</a>:</strong>  all this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:12">0:22:12-0:22:15</a>:</strong>  I kind of, I never let the drum get empty.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:15">0:22:15-0:22:21</a>:</strong>  So I'm assuming it has a lot of these original microbes from the starter kit that we started<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:21">0:22:21-0:22:24</a>:</strong>  with, but really I just top it up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:24">0:22:24-0:22:29</a>:</strong>  We live next door to our wonderful neighbors, Jared and Michelle who run Love Probiotics<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:29">0:22:29-0:22:34</a>:</strong>  and have a great line of fermented products that they sell here on Lake Atitlana and in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:34">0:22:34-0:22:35</a>:</strong>  Antigua.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:35">0:22:35-0:22:39</a>:</strong>  And they do kombuchas, ginger beer, junes, and every now and again they give me like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:39">0:22:39-0:22:43</a>:</strong>  a scoby or some leftover fermented ginger.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:43">0:22:43-0:22:47</a>:</strong>  And then at the farm we also make a lot of cheese, so we have a lot of whey, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:47">0:22:47-0:22:50</a>:</strong>  another kind of probiotic thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:50">0:22:50-0:22:54</a>:</strong>  And we're always doing little ferments, we make our own ginger beer, we make our own<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:54">0:22:54-0:22:55</a>:</strong>  sourdough bread.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:22:55">0:22:55-0:23:02</a>:</strong>  And so anytime I have a leftover something and I just put it into the bucket and I keep<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:02">0:23:02-0:23:11</a>:</strong>  it topped up with whey, panella, which is unprocessed cane sugar, and water from the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:11">0:23:11-0:23:15</a>:</strong>  river that doesn't have chlorine in it, I think is important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:15">0:23:15-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  We just keep it topped up and we spray it on the garden once a week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:22</a>:</strong>  We had been spraying it on the compost piles, but then we started to notice these things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:22">0:23:22-0:23:26</a>:</strong>  are getting so hot anyway, they're obviously full of all kinds of microbial life.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:26">0:23:26-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  So we're just adding a tiny bit on top maybe isn't it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:32</a>:</strong>  And they're probably all competed by these extremely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:32">0:23:32-0:23:36</a>:</strong>  But whatever else is in there and it's probably a lot of the same stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:36">0:23:36-0:23:42</a>:</strong>  So what we actually do with this stuff mostly now is we sweeten our animal feeds with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:42">0:23:42-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  It's kind of like one of the things, and we put a watering can to work on to the garden<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:23:48</a>:</strong>  every week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:48">0:23:48-0:23:54</a>:</strong>  So it's like you're kind of inoculating the plants and soil in the garden with it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:23:54">0:23:54-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  And what we also do is just like sort of our goal is to feed our animals as much from the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:04</a>:</strong>  valley as we can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:04">0:24:04-0:24:11</a>:</strong>  And we do, we feed our goats with about 80% fresh forage from the valley, which works<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:11">0:24:11-0:24:12</a>:</strong>  I think is really great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:12">0:24:12-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  But in order to get that real kick from their production really to kind of make it worthwhile,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:23</a>:</strong>  we do feed them some, we do give them some non-medicated concentrates.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:23">0:24:23-0:24:29</a>:</strong>  What we do with those is we just, we, it's actually, it's nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:29">0:24:29-0:24:30</a>:</strong>  I enjoy this process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:30">0:24:30-0:24:33</a>:</strong>  Yeah, you do seem to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:33">0:24:33-0:24:40</a>:</strong>  We mix, we mix in, so we take a five gallon bucket of the grain and then we mix in a handful<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:40">0:24:40-0:24:46</a>:</strong>  of our own homemade mineral mix, which is actually biochar or activated carbon, which<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:46">0:24:46-0:24:51</a>:</strong>  I'm sure Jer's going to talk about soon, which he, Jer, figured out an ingenious way of turning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:51">0:24:51-0:24:57</a>:</strong>  the coffee grains into biochar, sea salt, sodium bicarbonate, and ash.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:24:57">0:24:57-0:25:02</a>:</strong>  And we mix it in with that when it's dry and then we sweeten it with this kind of like,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:02">0:25:02-0:25:08</a>:</strong>  it tastes like a kind of a kombucha and the goats go crazy for it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:08">0:25:08-0:25:14</a>:</strong>  They eat it much more ferociously than they would if it wasn't sweetened.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:14">0:25:14-0:25:18</a>:</strong>  And so it's kind of like, I kind of think it's like, okay, it's concentrate, but we're,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:18">0:25:18-0:25:22</a>:</strong>  we're certainly getting really good medicine into them at the same time, probiotics and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:22">0:25:22-0:25:28</a>:</strong>  especially the, especially the activated carbon because goats are very prone to parasites.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:28">0:25:28-0:25:33</a>:</strong>  So I think the fact that they're like taking regular small amounts of activated carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:33">0:25:33-0:25:39</a>:</strong>  has, and probiotics has to be helping to alleviate that tendency that they have.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:39">0:25:39-0:25:43</a>:</strong>  And then finally, like, I think in terms of soil building, for me, it's like very nice<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:43">0:25:43-0:25:52</a>:</strong>  to think of all these like rich mineral sources becoming like microbially charged in the rumen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:52">0:25:52-0:25:56</a>:</strong>  of the goat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:25:56">0:25:56-0:26:02</a>:</strong>  Where you know, as I understand it, I guess I've taken courses in this stuff, a lot of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:02">0:26:02-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  the science and stuff goes over my head, but as I understand it, like goats, rumens, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:12</a>:</strong>  particularly any herbivore, their rumen is really like a kind of bio digester.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:12">0:26:12-0:26:20</a>:</strong>  And it has a lot of the microbes that are responsible for making minerals bioavailable<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:20">0:26:20-0:26:21</a>:</strong>  to plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:21">0:26:21-0:26:29</a>:</strong>  There's a good quote by Elaine Ingham where she says, every mineral that every plant needs<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:29">0:26:29-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  to survive is available in every handful of soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:37</a>:</strong>  And it's like, I think that's it, that might be wrong, but you know, something along those<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:37">0:26:37-0:26:43</a>:</strong>  lines, but usually they're not available because the microbial communities aren't present in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:43">0:26:43-0:26:50</a>:</strong>  the soil to actually break down these inorganic particles and make them bioavailable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:50">0:26:50-0:26:54</a>:</strong>  So you know, there's some really elaborate ways that soil scientists kind of talk about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:54">0:26:54-0:26:59</a>:</strong>  about doing this, but for me, just feeding them to goats and then passing that goat manure<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:26:59">0:26:59-0:27:03</a>:</strong>  through a system and putting it out into your garden is a pretty passive way of sort of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:03">0:27:03-0:27:05</a>:</strong>  doing that, you know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:05">0:27:05-0:27:10</a>:</strong>  Now Shet, have you used any extra additives or improvements for your own compost systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:10">0:27:10-0:27:15</a>:</strong>  or are you at the point where the simpler the better and trying to cut out any excess<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:15">0:27:15-0:27:16</a>:</strong>  steps?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:16">0:27:16-0:27:24</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so let's see, just I will, first I'll take a minute to just put a little bit of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:24">0:27:24-0:27:28</a>:</strong>  what Neil said in the context as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:28">0:27:28-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  I also am not really into these sorts of liquid fertilizer type things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:42</a>:</strong>  But one key distinction that's worth noting for listeners or whoever's interested in possibly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:42">0:27:42-0:27:47</a>:</strong>  following such recipes, like what Neil was talking about with the EM, which then became<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:47">0:27:47-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  kind of like just a probiotic living stew of whatever kind of probiotic sources you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:28:00</a>:</strong>  get, whether it was from a kombucha, etc. and he mentioned and then he'd get topped<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:00">0:28:00-0:28:03</a>:</strong>  up with canela, which is basically sweetened water.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:03">0:28:03-0:28:10</a>:</strong>  So what Neil was describing there, that EM mix, which converted into other sort of active<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:10">0:28:10-0:28:14</a>:</strong>  biological mix, they are all aerobic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:14">0:28:14-0:28:17</a>:</strong>  They're aerobic fermentations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:17">0:28:17-0:28:18</a>:</strong>  Lacto-fermentations are aerobic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:18">0:28:18-0:28:19</a>:</strong>  It means they have oxygen.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:19">0:28:19-0:28:23</a>:</strong>  They're not happening in oxygen core conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:23">0:28:23-0:28:25</a>:</strong>  They're happening in oxygen rich conditions.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:25">0:28:25-0:28:28</a>:</strong>  And so that is cool.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:28">0:28:28-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  Feed it to your animals, add it to the garden.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:31">0:28:31-0:28:35</a>:</strong>  It does all these things that Neil kind of talked about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:35">0:28:35-0:28:38</a>:</strong>  It regenerates the biological communities, etc., etc.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:38">0:28:38-0:28:43</a>:</strong>  But then communally, then Neil started talking about the inside of the rumen of a goat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:43">0:28:43-0:28:48</a>:</strong>  And then he said that actually it's kind of like a biodigester and that's exactly what<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:48">0:28:48-0:28:49</a>:</strong>  it is.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:49">0:28:49-0:28:50</a>:</strong>  It's spot on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:50">0:28:50-0:28:55</a>:</strong>  Those sorts of bacteria that live in that rumen are anaerobic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:55">0:28:55-0:28:57</a>:</strong>  There's no oxygen in them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:29:02</a>:</strong>  And what people often do with teas at home, so you're listening to this right now and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:02">0:29:02-0:29:03</a>:</strong>  you're like, this is sweet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:03">0:29:03-0:29:08</a>:</strong>  I'm going to like put some stuff into a bucket and let it sit for a while.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:08">0:29:08-0:29:10</a>:</strong>  It will most likely turn anaerobic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:10">0:29:10-0:29:11</a>:</strong>  It will become gross.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:11">0:29:11-0:29:12</a>:</strong>  It will smell gross.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:12">0:29:12-0:29:16</a>:</strong>  It won't smell like a nice kombucha or something you'd want to drink.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:16">0:29:16-0:29:18</a>:</strong>  It would be really disgusting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:18">0:29:18-0:29:20</a>:</strong>  And so here we go to wrap that up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:20">0:29:20-0:29:23</a>:</strong>  You have these aerobic ones and you have anaerobic ones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:23">0:29:23-0:29:25</a>:</strong>  So aerobic are the probiotics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:25">0:29:25-0:29:26</a>:</strong>  It's the E.M.s.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:26">0:29:26-0:29:27</a>:</strong>  It's all the life forms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:27">0:29:27-0:29:32</a>:</strong>  And the anaerobic ones are not necessarily smelling really good, but they're the ones<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:32">0:29:32-0:29:35</a>:</strong>  that make minerals bioavailable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:35">0:29:35-0:29:37</a>:</strong>  And so keep that in mind.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:37">0:29:37-0:29:40</a>:</strong>  I would not want to put anaerobic shit on my garden.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:40">0:29:40-0:29:45</a>:</strong>  Like I would want to oxygenate it first or in the form of those anaerobic bacteria in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:45">0:29:45-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  the rumen and then the output of that rumen, the poop compulsive, it becomes biological<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:29:52</a>:</strong>  again.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:52">0:29:52-0:29:55</a>:</strong>  So anaerobic stuff you want to treat with caution, but understand that they're the things<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:55">0:29:55-0:29:58</a>:</strong>  that might be necessary to make the minerals available.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:29:58">0:29:58-0:30:03</a>:</strong>  And the aerobic, the oxygenated stuff is kind of good to drink, to spray on your garden,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:03">0:30:03-0:30:05</a>:</strong>  to do whatever with and to probably the best to chug it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:05">0:30:05-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  The chat drew some of ours.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:13</a>:</strong>  We were doing garden club and I brought some up and chat thought it was a kombucha.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:13">0:30:13-0:30:18</a>:</strong>  I thought it was a kombucha and all these guys are like, and he was like, yeah, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:18">0:30:18-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  can drink it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:22</a>:</strong>  And I'm like kind of far away and then I'm watching all the people in the course and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:22">0:30:22-0:30:25</a>:</strong>  they're like taking the teeny sip and making these really like gross faces.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:25">0:30:25-0:30:30</a>:</strong>  And I'm just like, man, what has holes like Neil brought some sweet ginger beer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:30">0:30:30-0:30:31</a>:</strong>  Didn't even tell me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:31">0:30:31-0:30:33</a>:</strong>  No one wants to try it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:33">0:30:33-0:30:34</a>:</strong>  They're all judgmental.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:34">0:30:34-0:30:35</a>:</strong>  They're like, this is gross.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:35">0:30:35-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  And then I just like went over and pounded like a meter of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:30:41</a>:</strong>  Oh my god.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:41">0:30:41-0:30:42</a>:</strong>  Oh my god.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:42">0:30:42-0:30:45</a>:</strong>  Well, you know, if it's good for you, go.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:45">0:30:45-0:30:48</a>:</strong>  It's like Neil needs to step up his ginger beer.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:48">0:30:48-0:30:51</a>:</strong>  Kind of tastes like old socks.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:51">0:30:51-0:30:56</a>:</strong>  I've been taking a little bit of a very similar product recently that I found that somebody<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:30:56">0:30:56-0:31:01</a>:</strong>  is selling around here at the lake and it smells and tastes very similar to E.M.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:01">0:31:01-0:31:04</a>:</strong>  You're just supposed to take a cap full of it and mix it in with water, like put it in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:04">0:31:04-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  with a smoothie.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:07</a>:</strong>  But I've had great results from it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:07">0:31:07-0:31:13</a>:</strong>  I've read that a lot of a lot of nutritionists are not a lot of nutritionists, but do take<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:13">0:31:13-0:31:18</a>:</strong>  this E.M. product and just repackage it and sell it as a program.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:18">0:31:18-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  I would imagine that was happening.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:23</a>:</strong>  So yeah, so just like people are looking for this, go do some research.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:23">0:31:23-0:31:27</a>:</strong>  But the simplest way to do it is to just sweeten the water or aerate it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:27">0:31:27-0:31:29</a>:</strong>  You need to put a pump in it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:29">0:31:29-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  You can put some plants that are rich in minerals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:34</a>:</strong>  You can put a little manure in there or soccer compost or something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:34">0:31:34-0:31:39</a>:</strong>  Then you aerate it or add that probiotic thing that will make it bubble and feed it something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:39">0:31:39-0:31:40</a>:</strong>  sweet.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:40">0:31:40-0:31:41</a>:</strong>  That'll be aerobic and that's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:41">0:31:41-0:31:48</a>:</strong>  If you wanted to dabble in the anaerobic stuff, you would want to, after you get it, make<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:48">0:31:48-0:31:51</a>:</strong>  it oxygenated before you put it in your garden.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:51">0:31:51-0:31:56</a>:</strong>  And just be wary of that stinky fermented tea that smells really gross because I see<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:56">0:31:56-0:31:57</a>:</strong>  that happening a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:57">0:31:57-0:31:58</a>:</strong>  People think that's a compost tea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:58">0:31:58-0:31:59</a>:</strong>  It's not a compost tea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:31:59">0:31:59-0:32:04</a>:</strong>  It's kind of like a mix of the two and it won't really do good for anything.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:04">0:32:04-0:32:09</a>:</strong>  Now going back to just my personal approach to it, I don't do that stuff just because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:09">0:32:09-0:32:13</a>:</strong>  in our setup and our scale, we don't just never fit for us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:13">0:32:13-0:32:19</a>:</strong>  I have used fish emulsions, oxygenated fish emulsions in the past when I had sandy soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:19">0:32:19-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  and no fertility.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:20">0:32:20-0:32:23</a>:</strong>  But we have more fertility on the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:23">0:32:23-0:32:25</a>:</strong>  So I'm like the simplest thing that matters.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:25">0:32:25-0:32:31</a>:</strong>  I bring in the straw and any other organic matter and the restaurant scraps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:31">0:32:31-0:32:36</a>:</strong>  And we basically are only compost pile and the whole entire farm is under our chickens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:36">0:32:36-0:32:39</a>:</strong>  And anything that we don't burn goes in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:39">0:32:39-0:32:40</a>:</strong>  And that just suits our approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:40">0:32:40-0:32:41</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:41">0:32:41-0:32:46</a>:</strong>  You have a super simple approach, which is really great from a learning point of view<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:46">0:32:46-0:32:47</a>:</strong>  because you're like, wow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:47">0:32:47-0:32:49</a>:</strong>  And from a business point of view, I mean, we're going to talk about this a little bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:49">0:32:49-0:32:55</a>:</strong>  more in a minute, but efficiency is a huge aspect of making a farming or production model<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:55">0:32:55-0:32:56</a>:</strong>  profitable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:32:56">0:32:56-0:33:00</a>:</strong>  And if you add a whole bunch of unnecessary steps or maybe they're necessary, maybe they<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:00">0:33:00-0:33:05</a>:</strong>  have a function, but if they can't be justified by the amount of time or human labor put into<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:05">0:33:05-0:33:09</a>:</strong>  them, it's really hard to justify them in a profitable model.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:09">0:33:09-0:33:15</a>:</strong>  Now I know that there's one other main additive to the compost that especially Neil and Jeremy<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:15">0:33:15-0:33:17</a>:</strong>  have been trying lately and that's biochar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:17">0:33:17-0:33:21</a>:</strong>  And I know that Jeremy knows a lot more about this and has been experimenting with it on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:21">0:33:21-0:33:22</a>:</strong>  the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:22">0:33:22-0:33:26</a>:</strong>  So do you want to tell us a little bit about the method that you've discovered for turning<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:26">0:33:26-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  all of the coffee hulls into biochar and some of the other things you've been able to do<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:33:34</a>:</strong>  with that method?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:34">0:33:34-0:33:35</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:35">0:33:35-0:33:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:36">0:33:36-0:33:42</a>:</strong>  Sort of like the same style in mind as all the other things we talked about, really try<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:42">0:33:42-0:33:44</a>:</strong>  to simplify it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:44">0:33:44-0:33:49</a>:</strong>  And actually we're doing on quite a small scale compared to what other people might<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:49">0:33:49-0:33:50</a>:</strong>  do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:50">0:33:50-0:33:56</a>:</strong>  I'll also say it's probably not the most efficient system, but because it's on a small scale<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:33:56">0:33:56-0:34:01</a>:</strong>  and we have waste product to use, it seems to work fine for us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:01">0:34:01-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  And we try to use this system to do other things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:10</a>:</strong>  I'll talk about in a minute, but like smoking, like smoke cooked chickens on the inside of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:10">0:34:10-0:34:16</a>:</strong>  the oven as you do the biochars, the way we found to like make it justifiable to really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:16">0:34:16-0:34:17</a>:</strong>  have the process go forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:17">0:34:17-0:34:20</a>:</strong>  Sure, it's not functioned via smoke chicken at the end.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:20">0:34:20-0:34:24</a>:</strong>  I mean, because otherwise you're just burning loads of fuel and you do get some product<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:32</a>:</strong>  out of it, but there's a pretty high heat cost to doing it, which wouldn't work otherwise<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:32">0:34:32-0:34:33</a>:</strong>  probably.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:33">0:34:33-0:34:39</a>:</strong>  So, I guess I'll explain real quick why biochar is important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:39">0:34:39-0:34:47</a>:</strong>  All the other organic matter kind of, it's a form of carbon, inorganic carbon basically,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:47">0:34:47-0:34:53</a>:</strong>  and it works like organic matter in the soil or broken down living carbon, like what would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:53">0:34:53-0:34:55</a>:</strong>  come from hay or leaves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:34:55">0:34:55-0:35:01</a>:</strong>  The thing about this organic carbon sources that create this black fluffy earth is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:01">0:35:01-0:35:03</a>:</strong>  they eventually exhaust from the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:03">0:35:03-0:35:11</a>:</strong>  The microbial communities use them as a calorie and they break it down and eventually it all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:11">0:35:11-0:35:14</a>:</strong>  gets exhausted into the air in the form of CO2.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:14">0:35:14-0:35:17</a>:</strong>  It seems like it's oxygen that goes back into the atmosphere.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:17">0:35:17-0:35:18</a>:</strong>  Exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:18">0:35:18-0:35:20</a>:</strong>  Yeah, oxidized, whatever you want to call it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:20">0:35:20-0:35:23</a>:</strong>  Or just turned into a class.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:23">0:35:23-0:35:29</a>:</strong>  Oh yeah, I mean the plants are creating more carbon thanks to the organic matter in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:29">0:35:29-0:35:35</a>:</strong>  soil, but you do have to keep adding it as the idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:35">0:35:35-0:35:41</a>:</strong>  If you can cut out that step, that could mean huge things for any gardener.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:41">0:35:41-0:35:49</a>:</strong>  Bringing in the carbon is always a really extensive and continual process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:49">0:35:49-0:35:53</a>:</strong>  What biochar basically does is create this organic matter in your soil to create communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:35:53">0:35:53-0:36:00</a>:</strong>  for soil microorganisms to hold onto water, to hold onto nutrients really well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:00">0:36:00-0:36:06</a>:</strong>  It does not exhaust from the soil because it's actually inorganic or it's become mineralized<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:06">0:36:06-0:36:09</a>:</strong>  through this heating process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:09">0:36:09-0:36:14</a>:</strong>  And what that means is it can exist in the soil much like any mineral for thousands of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:14">0:36:14-0:36:21</a>:</strong>  years or indefinitely, some people say it lasts like 10,000 to 30,000 years, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:21">0:36:21-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  like more than enough for me to really...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, more than you need to remember.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:27">0:36:27-0:36:32</a>:</strong>  Which kind of has interesting ramifications, like you're creating permanent fertility on<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:32">0:36:32-0:36:37</a>:</strong>  a piece of land, which really feels nice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:37">0:36:37-0:36:40</a>:</strong>  The interesting thing is how do you actually make this stuff and what do you make it out<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:40">0:36:40-0:36:41</a>:</strong>  of?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:41">0:36:41-0:36:47</a>:</strong>  A lot of people talk about this using any old bits of carbon like scraps of wood or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:47">0:36:47-0:36:50</a>:</strong>  leaves or sawdust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:36:54</a>:</strong>  And the second two, I would say would be a better idea than scraps of wood because the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:54">0:36:54-0:36:57</a>:</strong>  scraps of wood are quite dense and they're all in different sizes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:36:57">0:36:57-0:37:02</a>:</strong>  So, they don't break down at the same time into the black, you know, charcoal bits that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:02">0:37:02-0:37:05</a>:</strong>  you want to sort of powder, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:05">0:37:05-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  Which you can do it, but it's not very efficient because you're like...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:08">0:37:08-0:37:10</a>:</strong>  So, higher surface area is ideal?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:11</a>:</strong>  Higher surface area...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:11">0:37:11-0:37:13</a>:</strong>  Even heating and the product that you want...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:13">0:37:13-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  Break down and like the consistent texture...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:21</a>:</strong>  You want something that looks like activated charcoal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:21">0:37:21-0:37:22</a>:</strong>  Already...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:22">0:37:22-0:37:23</a>:</strong>  Because that's kind of what it is really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:23">0:37:23-0:37:27</a>:</strong>  Yeah, these powdery flakes of black stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:27">0:37:27-0:37:31</a>:</strong>  And if you were looking under a microscope, it would look like a totally crazy looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:31">0:37:31-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  sponge structure with all these little passageways and holes like micro pores in it, like you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:39</a>:</strong>  know, just so much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:39">0:37:39-0:37:43</a>:</strong>  And what we use, you got to find the right material and make it one that's available<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:43">0:37:43-0:37:48</a>:</strong>  hopefully free or if it's not free and abundant, free and abundant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:48">0:37:48-0:37:52</a>:</strong>  We use the shells from the coffee, they're the hull of the coffee after you take the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:52">0:37:52-0:37:53</a>:</strong>  pulp off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:37:53">0:37:53-0:38:00</a>:</strong>  There's this dry parchment shell around the outside, what they call it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:00">0:38:00-0:38:06</a>:</strong>  And the buddy that roasts the coffee for us and for most people around our area has just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:06">0:38:06-0:38:08</a>:</strong>  so much of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:08">0:38:08-0:38:12</a>:</strong>  And you know, he's like using it as mulch and other things, but he's not really, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:12">0:38:12-0:38:13</a>:</strong>  know, he's just kind of, oh yeah, that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:13">0:38:13-0:38:15</a>:</strong>  And it's not a great mulch really.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:15">0:38:15-0:38:17</a>:</strong>  It's kind of somewhat impermeable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:17">0:38:17-0:38:21</a>:</strong>  Well, it doesn't soak up moisture in its raw form.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:21">0:38:21-0:38:26</a>:</strong>  It's silica rich, so it's almost like this like little glass shells around the coffee.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:26">0:38:26-0:38:27</a>:</strong>  So it's not doing a whole lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:27">0:38:27-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  It might keep moisture in the soil, but sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:30</a>:</strong>  It's a little bit, but it's still organic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:32</a>:</strong>  But it can also wick it off the surface too.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:32">0:38:32-0:38:34</a>:</strong>  I've seen it do that for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:34">0:38:34-0:38:36</a>:</strong>  And it's kind of just slow to break down.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:36">0:38:36-0:38:42</a>:</strong>  It's just not really a high value product on its own.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:42">0:38:42-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  So we just, we're like, give us as much as you can get over here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:48</a>:</strong>  You know, anytime you come over, please bring a bag.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:48">0:38:48-0:38:51</a>:</strong>  And so now we have loads of it and we're just using it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:51">0:38:51-0:38:57</a>:</strong>  Anytime we get a chicken from Shad or we kill a duck or something like that, toss it right<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:57">0:38:57-0:38:58</a>:</strong>  in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:38:58">0:38:58-0:39:02</a>:</strong>  Cause it means we get to make biochar and we get to use a lot of the scrap wood from<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:02">0:39:02-0:39:08</a>:</strong>  our construction to heat what we call the retort or the container that you put the biochar<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:08">0:39:08-0:39:09</a>:</strong>  material in.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:09">0:39:09-0:39:16</a>:</strong>  So you have the sort of tin vessel or whatever it's made out of steel vessel that's oxygen<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:16">0:39:16-0:39:19</a>:</strong>  can't get into, but heat can conduct into it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:19">0:39:19-0:39:20</a>:</strong>  So basically you bake...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:20">0:39:20-0:39:22</a>:</strong>  And oxygen can escape from it actually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:22">0:39:22-0:39:28</a>:</strong>  Yeah, you do need a, well, gases, not, not, yeah, yeah, it needs to vent.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:28">0:39:28-0:39:32</a>:</strong>  There's all sorts of organic gases that come out of it, which are not good for the atmosphere<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:32">0:39:32-0:39:37</a>:</strong>  they're like intense greenhouse gases and they're flammable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:37">0:39:37-0:39:42</a>:</strong>  So the trick with biochar is that you send the gases back into the heating element or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:42">0:39:42-0:39:46</a>:</strong>  the stove underneath so it can burn off and actually heat itself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:46">0:39:46-0:39:50</a>:</strong>  And once these guys get kicking, ours is very inefficient by the way, it's like we don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:39:52</a>:</strong>  even have that step down right now, unfortunately.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:52">0:39:52-0:39:56</a>:</strong>  I'd like to get that working, but where we have to get a welder in there and start...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:56">0:39:56-0:39:58</a>:</strong>  I'll just interrupt for a sec.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:39:58">0:39:58-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  Just like being very humble here, this is actually like arguably my favorite design<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:05</a>:</strong>  feature on our farm because it's like...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:05">0:40:05-0:40:09</a>:</strong>  Oh sure, because of the other biochar furnaces, you don't get to smoke birds.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:09">0:40:09-0:40:15</a>:</strong>  And by putting the technique Jare came up with of just really having a fire pit where<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:15">0:40:15-0:40:21</a>:</strong>  we burn our waste construction material, putting a drum over the top of it that has a door<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:21">0:40:21-0:40:25</a>:</strong>  and a rack where the chicken can go up on top of the rack and the coffee shells go down<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:25">0:40:25-0:40:28</a>:</strong>  onto the bottom, it creates this kind of insulating effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:28">0:40:28-0:40:32</a>:</strong>  So the chicken like cooks in really slowly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:32">0:40:32-0:40:36</a>:</strong>  And then to stop the biochar going too far, Jare puts in a little bit of water, what at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:36">0:40:36-0:40:38</a>:</strong>  about the three quarter of a mile.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:38">0:40:38-0:40:39</a>:</strong>  Yeah, exactly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:39">0:40:39-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  And that water just kind of goes in and it means the chicken sort of plumps up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:46</a>:</strong>  So you get this actually quite smoke steam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:46">0:40:46-0:40:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah, smokey steam.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:47">0:40:47-0:40:52</a>:</strong>  You take a smokey steamed chicken and he always marinates it before and then it just comes<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:52">0:40:52-0:40:53</a>:</strong>  out amazing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:53">0:40:53-0:40:57</a>:</strong>  So it's amazing, so it's almost, it would be worth lighting that amount of wood just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:57">0:40:57-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  to produce a chicken of this quality.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:40:59">0:40:59-0:41:04</a>:</strong>  And the fact that you get this amazing soil amendment as well, I think it's like, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:04">0:41:04-0:41:06</a>:</strong>  a beautiful system and I really liked it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:06">0:41:06-0:41:10</a>:</strong>  He just did it without spending any money playing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:10">0:41:10-0:41:12</a>:</strong>  It was a drum that we'd already had.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:12">0:41:12-0:41:14</a>:</strong>  Yeah, we had tried it before for a while.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:14">0:41:14-0:41:15</a>:</strong>  We tried to build an oven.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:15">0:41:15-0:41:17</a>:</strong>  Yeah, yeah, we used it for so many things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:17">0:41:17-0:41:20</a>:</strong>  And I had one of those like wake up in the middle of the night moments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:20">0:41:20-0:41:22</a>:</strong>  I was like, whoa, wait a minute.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:22">0:41:22-0:41:24</a>:</strong>  What are we doing?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:24">0:41:24-0:41:27</a>:</strong>  Let's use this tin barrel or whatever steel barrel.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:27">0:41:27-0:41:32</a>:</strong>  Okay, so talk to me now about how you in with soil amendments because it's not something<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:32">0:41:32-0:41:34</a>:</strong>  you can just throw on top of your garden beds, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:34">0:41:34-0:41:36</a>:</strong>  Yeah, good point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:36">0:41:36-0:41:42</a>:</strong>  So after it's been cooked down and it's in this really fine texture, we consider that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:42">0:41:42-0:41:44</a>:</strong>  activated charcoal.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:44">0:41:44-0:41:51</a>:</strong>  It's activated in the sense that it's ready to receive or pull in loads of nutrients and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:51">0:41:51-0:41:54</a>:</strong>  solution, anything, even parasites and other stuff like that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:54">0:41:54-0:41:58</a>:</strong>  That's why Neil is so psyched about giving it to the goats because it will just suck<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:41:58">0:41:58-0:42:04</a>:</strong>  them right out of its stomach lining and pull it down through and out of the animal system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:04">0:42:04-0:42:06</a>:</strong>  And same for humans, I could use this stuff if I needed to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:06">0:42:06-0:42:08</a>:</strong>  I'd use it when I had parasites.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:08">0:42:08-0:42:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah, again, it's a really good way of rendering them inactive and clearing your system out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:12">0:42:12-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I'm gonna like, one of our guys has got a bad case I got right now, Miguel actually.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:20</a>:</strong>  I'm gonna like slip some in his food later and not tell him.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:20">0:42:20-0:42:21</a>:</strong>  I'm just kidding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:21">0:42:21-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  Yeah, he'll be really surprised when his poop all comes out black.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:25</a>:</strong>  Yeah, no, just kidding.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:25">0:42:25-0:42:28</a>:</strong>  He'll probably take it anyways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:28">0:42:28-0:42:29</a>:</strong>  But it's great for all that stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:29">0:42:29-0:42:33</a>:</strong>  It has so many uses, you clean water with it, whatever, if you want it to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:33">0:42:33-0:42:39</a>:</strong>  And we don't produce a lot of it, so I like that we're using it for these specific concentrated<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:39">0:42:39-0:42:40</a>:</strong>  uses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:40">0:42:40-0:42:46</a>:</strong>  And all the extra biochar goes into our worm production system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:46">0:42:46-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  We were adding it to our animal house system, but it was almost like a drop in the bucket.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:51">0:42:51-0:42:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah, drop in the ocean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:52">0:42:52-0:42:54</a>:</strong>  It was like, all right, so it's in there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:54">0:42:54-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  Maybe like, I'm not sure how much compared to...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  Half a gallon bucket into a hundred chicken house.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:00</a>:</strong>  It's like...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:00">0:43:00-0:43:03</a>:</strong>  Not a whole, not saying a whole lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:03">0:43:03-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  But if you put it into your worm compost and you have them, the juices from the worms soaking<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:13</a>:</strong>  in constantly, you have a really fine, really like high-end product basically.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:13">0:43:13-0:43:18</a>:</strong>  And the worms would also pass, the worms would eat it and excrete it out as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:18">0:43:18-0:43:24</a>:</strong>  And then it becomes charged or inoculated immediately when the worms work through it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:24">0:43:24-0:43:28</a>:</strong>  And so what that means is now it's ready to go in your garden and it's going to have all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:28">0:43:28-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  these amazing effects.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:31</a>:</strong>  It's going to hold onto the nutrients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:31">0:43:31-0:43:37</a>:</strong>  It gives it to the plants easier because we mentioned the microbes need to be present<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:37">0:43:37-0:43:41</a>:</strong>  for the plants to receive a lot of these minerals and they're in the biochar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:41">0:43:41-0:43:45</a>:</strong>  They're being received from the worms or whatever other sort of active compost that you have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:45">0:43:45-0:43:48</a>:</strong>  it mixed into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:48">0:43:48-0:43:49</a>:</strong>  So it actually...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:49">0:43:49-0:43:50</a>:</strong>  And it will...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:50">0:43:50-0:43:54</a>:</strong>  It's important to realize that I think because it will, otherwise, if you just put it straight<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:54">0:43:54-0:43:58</a>:</strong>  on your soil, it will actually, it will charge itself in your soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:43:58">0:43:58-0:44:00</a>:</strong>  Sort of leech the nutrients out of the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:00">0:44:00-0:44:03</a>:</strong>  Not leech, it would pull them away from the plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:03">0:44:03-0:44:05</a>:</strong>  It would out-compete your plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:05">0:44:05-0:44:06</a>:</strong>  So it will actually...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:06">0:44:06-0:44:12</a>:</strong>  I've heard cases of it actually when it's added on-charge to gardens or farms that it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:12">0:44:12-0:44:15</a>:</strong>  has like a negative result on yield.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:15">0:44:15-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  It could take years for this stuff to build up if you don't.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:20</a>:</strong>  That's what happened to me the first time I made it when I was over in EMAP.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:20">0:44:20-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  I made a bunch of it out of corn stalks and they added it as mulch to the garden and all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:31</a>:</strong>  the plants just shriveled up and got kind of yellow because it was actually robbing<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:31">0:44:31-0:44:35</a>:</strong>  nitrogen from the plants.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:35">0:44:35-0:44:37</a>:</strong>  What kind of concentrations are we talking about here?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:37">0:44:37-0:44:45</a>:</strong>  How much biochar would you ideally add to a really well-charged fertile soil system<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:45">0:44:45-0:44:46</a>:</strong>  for a market garden?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:46">0:44:46-0:44:47</a>:</strong>  As much as you possibly can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:47">0:44:47-0:44:49</a>:</strong>  It's like you can't add too much but you really...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:49">0:44:49-0:44:50</a>:</strong>  Recharge.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:50">0:44:50-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:44:54</a>:</strong>  As long as it's inoculated, you could really just...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:54">0:44:54-0:44:58</a>:</strong>  I guess I would add it in small amounts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:44:58">0:44:58-0:45:02</a>:</strong>  What I like to do now is what I'm thinking is like put it in our nursery, into the plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:02">0:45:02-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  we're going to put into the ground so that they're there with them from the start because<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:10</a>:</strong>  that's where plants need it most especially is when they're like growing and putting it<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:10">0:45:10-0:45:15</a>:</strong>  deep in your garden is really nice because if you have it at the bottom of a say a planting<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:15">0:45:15-0:45:20</a>:</strong>  area, all the nutrients that would leach out during the rainy season for instance will<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:20">0:45:20-0:45:23</a>:</strong>  get trapped down there by the stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:23">0:45:23-0:45:27</a>:</strong>  So you think about the most effective use of it I guess because you never make that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:27">0:45:27-0:45:28</a>:</strong>  much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:28">0:45:28-0:45:31</a>:</strong>  The only people that make a really lot of it have a big system that they're working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:31">0:45:31-0:45:33</a>:</strong>  on and it's beautiful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:33">0:45:33-0:45:36</a>:</strong>  It's a byproduct and they use the heat for something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:36">0:45:36-0:45:44</a>:</strong>  We're using it for chickens but we have a friend Klaus who uses rice hulls and he cooks<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:44">0:45:44-0:45:48</a>:</strong>  the rice hulls to make the biochar and the heat works as a kiln or works in a kiln to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:45:50</a>:</strong>  dry wood.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:50">0:45:50-0:45:51</a>:</strong>  He stores and processes lumber.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:51">0:45:51-0:45:55</a>:</strong>  You want to use energy as many times as possible before you can't reclaim it, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:55">0:45:55-0:45:57</a>:</strong>  And that's more important on a larger scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:45:57">0:45:57-0:46:02</a>:</strong>  For our scale, we wouldn't try to set up some elaborate kiln drying system if we were just<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:02">0:46:02-0:46:04</a>:</strong>  gonna use it every once in a while.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:04">0:46:04-0:46:12</a>:</strong>  We might maybe if we could get like a weekly rotisserie smoked chicken at the Atlantic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:12">0:46:12-0:46:15</a>:</strong>  stay going, maybe we could do like...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:15">0:46:15-0:46:17</a>:</strong>  Make a dehydrator connected to it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:17">0:46:17-0:46:23</a>:</strong>  I'm still super excited about the idea of making a sauna that churns out biochar.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:23">0:46:23-0:46:25</a>:</strong>  I'm still working on this idea.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:25">0:46:25-0:46:26</a>:</strong>  I gotta get...<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:26">0:46:26-0:46:28</a>:</strong>  I gotta get a space to work on that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:28">0:46:28-0:46:29</a>:</strong>  It's like patting that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:29">0:46:29-0:46:32</a>:</strong>  Yeah, and then like maybe it could heat water as a byproduct of the exhaust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:32">0:46:32-0:46:35</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of ways of reclaiming heat.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:35">0:46:35-0:46:38</a>:</strong>  But let's switch gears for just a second here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:38">0:46:38-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  I want to talk before we run out of time about some of the new endeavors and how you guys<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:46:45</a>:</strong>  are moving forward with your respective farms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:45">0:46:45-0:46:50</a>:</strong>  I know that you have been trying to form an Athy Laut Organics Cooperative.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:50">0:46:50-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  Tell us a little bit about where we're at in that process and how working with the local<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:55">0:46:55-0:46:58</a>:</strong>  community is starting to advance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:46:58">0:46:58-0:47:00</a>:</strong>  Yeah, let's see.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:00">0:47:00-0:47:15</a>:</strong>  So the reality here is there's no real infrastructure to sell into for these small organic products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:15">0:47:15-0:47:19</a>:</strong>  There's not like distributors of them already existing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:19">0:47:19-0:47:26</a>:</strong>  And furthermore, the demand is really high and each individual holding both of international<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:26">0:47:26-0:47:30</a>:</strong>  people and locals is like not ever enough to satisfy the demand.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:30">0:47:30-0:47:34</a>:</strong>  So just part of the reality is that there will always be a larger demand for organic<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:34">0:47:34-0:47:40</a>:</strong>  food than any one individual person here could satisfy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:40">0:47:40-0:47:45</a>:</strong>  And there's really no way that you can reach that market even though it exists.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:45">0:47:45-0:47:52</a>:</strong>  So we're kind of having to figure out all the details of like how do you package these<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:52">0:47:52-0:47:53</a>:</strong>  things?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:53">0:47:53-0:47:56</a>:</strong>  How do you maintain communication with customers?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:56">0:47:56-0:47:57</a>:</strong>  How do you distribute them?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:57">0:47:57-0:47:59</a>:</strong>  How do you charge for them?<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:47:59">0:47:59-0:48:01</a>:</strong>  That whole kind of chain.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:01">0:48:01-0:48:07</a>:</strong>  And naturally it works better when you handle more products, of course.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:07">0:48:07-0:48:15</a>:</strong>  So yeah, Neil and Jeremy and I have been working for now over a year, we're basically a bit<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:15">0:48:15-0:48:17</a>:</strong>  of a year ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:17">0:48:17-0:48:37</a>:</strong>  I decided it was in Hot<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:37">0:48:37-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  T-Gan.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:41</a>:</strong>  And we decided to sell it to them, potentially like kind of like a rent to buy type sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:41">0:48:41-0:48:43</a>:</strong>  of situation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:43">0:48:43-0:48:45</a>:</strong>  And so they took the goats over.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:45">0:48:45-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  But in that arrangement, we basically decided to sell under the same label that is Hot T-Gan<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:48:56</a>:</strong>  Organics, partly because of the recognition that's around here and it has, you know, kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:56">0:48:56-0:48:57</a>:</strong>  of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:57">0:48:57-0:48:59</a>:</strong>  Well, your operation is a lot more developed at this point.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:48:59">0:48:59-0:49:04</a>:</strong>  Developed and just also the idea that the word organic is in there lends itself to products<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:04">0:49:04-0:49:05</a>:</strong>  that are organic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:05">0:49:05-0:49:10</a>:</strong>  And so anyway, basically we now have the two of us working together.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:10">0:49:10-0:49:11</a>:</strong>  We've been for many years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:11">0:49:11-0:49:14</a>:</strong>  So we're here at the Bamboo Guesthouse right now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:14">0:49:14-0:49:18</a>:</strong>  Our head chef also has a greenhouse up above where he grows organic tomatoes and chili<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:18">0:49:18-0:49:23</a>:</strong>  peppers, but also salads that supplement our production.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:23">0:49:23-0:49:25</a>:</strong>  So we buy salads from him.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:25">0:49:25-0:49:31</a>:</strong>  We have two local egg producers in addition to assistance from Neil and Jeremy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:31">0:49:31-0:49:36</a>:</strong>  And so we have a team of local people as well that are starting to tap into this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:36">0:49:36-0:49:41</a>:</strong>  But really the work before looking for products is figuring out those logistics.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:41">0:49:41-0:49:47</a>:</strong>  And so a big step I think we've made in service of this is we now have started to share the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:47">0:49:47-0:49:48</a>:</strong>  delivery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:48">0:49:48-0:49:50</a>:</strong>  So, so I do that again, it's farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:50">0:49:50-0:49:54</a>:</strong>  Our farm manager basically communicates with other clients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:54">0:49:54-0:49:58</a>:</strong>  That's like part of our responsibility is taking in all the orders.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:49:58">0:49:58-0:50:00</a>:</strong>  And then we deliver to two different towns twice a week.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:00">0:50:00-0:50:03</a>:</strong>  And so now I'll do that organics team takes both.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:03">0:50:03-0:50:08</a>:</strong>  I'll do that organics and groundhouse, the key and Jeremy's products to one town.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:08">0:50:08-0:50:11</a>:</strong>  And then the other town is covered by groundhouse, the key and Jeremy.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:11">0:50:11-0:50:21</a>:</strong>  So the fact that we could basically like dovetail our need for transportation into serving both<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:21">0:50:21-0:50:25</a>:</strong>  of us and having our time of delivering is like a big step in that direction where I<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:25">0:50:25-0:50:30</a>:</strong>  see it could go and maybe Neil or Jeremy, you guys want to add in on this after I would<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:30">0:50:30-0:50:36</a>:</strong>  like to see the branding continue to improve and the packaging and the presentation in<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:36">0:50:36-0:50:40</a>:</strong>  the stores and at the restaurants that use our products to continue to improve.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:40">0:50:40-0:50:48</a>:</strong>  I'd like to continue to improve the logistics of transport and then thoughtfully add new<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:48">0:50:48-0:50:51</a>:</strong>  products one by one.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:51">0:50:51-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  Yeah.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I couldn't agree more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:51:00</a>:</strong>  I think it's great.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:00">0:51:00-0:51:07</a>:</strong>  I think trying to find ways to work symbiotically with alongside each other.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:07">0:51:07-0:51:12</a>:</strong>  And I think in some ways it's the basis of good community, you know.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:12">0:51:12-0:51:15</a>:</strong>  So definitely so far so good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:15">0:51:15-0:51:17</a>:</strong>  It was a great gesture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:17">0:51:17-0:51:26</a>:</strong>  It was like a real shad giving us a loan of the goats like a year and a year and two or<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:26">0:51:26-0:51:33</a>:</strong>  three months ago was a huge shot in the arm for our farm and to get goats that were already<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:33">0:51:33-0:51:37</a>:</strong>  producing milk, it was like a huge head start.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:37">0:51:37-0:51:39</a>:</strong>  And then, yeah, we put a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:39">0:51:39-0:51:45</a>:</strong>  It did take us the guts of the year probably to have really, really consistent consistency<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:45">0:51:45-0:51:48</a>:</strong>  with our production and products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:48">0:51:48-0:51:56</a>:</strong>  So you know, now it's I do kind of feel like proud to be a member of this thing where regularly<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:51:56">0:51:56-0:52:01</a>:</strong>  in stores and restaurants all over the lake there's really good high quality chicken,<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:01">0:52:01-0:52:11</a>:</strong>  eggs, salad, cooking greens, dairy, milk and cheese, you know, like all really good top<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:11">0:52:11-0:52:13</a>:</strong>  notch products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:13">0:52:13-0:52:18</a>:</strong>  There's loads of other things that both Shad and ourselves have planted and have had plenty<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:18">0:52:18-0:52:26</a>:</strong>  of experience growing like sweet potatoes, malanga, taro root, turmeric, cheese tomatoes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:26">0:52:26-0:52:32</a>:</strong>  These are all like perennial crops basically that well not come out they're not perennial<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:32">0:52:32-0:52:39</a>:</strong>  but you know sort of easy crops to grow that things just want to grow and lake to grow<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:39">0:52:39-0:52:44</a>:</strong>  here that I would be really excited to look into expanding the thing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:44">0:52:44-0:52:52</a>:</strong>  But Shad's right, it's like there's quite a lot to figure out for each product.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:52">0:52:52-0:52:58</a>:</strong>  I know that's a topic for another podcast all the intricacies of actually selling and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:52:58">0:52:58-0:53:02</a>:</strong>  distributing your products because as we've talked about so much here and also in other<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:02">0:53:02-0:53:07</a>:</strong>  interviews I've done it's pretty easy to grow things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:07">0:53:07-0:53:11</a>:</strong>  It's pretty easy to get products out of the ground either through plants or through animals<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:11">0:53:11-0:53:15</a>:</strong>  but managing the business side of it is a whole other aspect and I definitely look forward<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:15">0:53:15-0:53:17</a>:</strong>  to exploring that more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:17">0:53:17-0:53:21</a>:</strong>  I just gave, we're hosting a PDC right now, a permaculture design certification course<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:21">0:53:21-0:53:27</a>:</strong>  we host a couple of years so if you're listening and interested in coming and learning and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:27">0:53:27-0:53:29</a>:</strong>  practicing here check us out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:29">0:53:29-0:53:33</a>:</strong>  But we're teaching one right now and this morning was the talk on kind of permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:33">0:53:33-0:53:40</a>:</strong>  inspired businesses, triple bottom line businesses, land-based endeavors with an intention to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:40">0:53:40-0:53:46</a>:</strong>  make something at least to cover the expenses of the totality of the operation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:46">0:53:46-0:53:52</a>:</strong>  And I quoted Joel Saladin who's kind of like my role model in this whole realm of like<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:52">0:53:52-0:53:54</a>:</strong>  farm business and farm entrepreneurship.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:53:54">0:53:54-0:54:02</a>:</strong>  He says even nature rewards even the most feeble attempt at production, like even the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:02">0:54:02-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  crappiest attempt to grow some food usually grows some food, like nature's pretty sweet<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:08</a>:</strong>  just like gives you something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:08">0:54:08-0:54:13</a>:</strong>  But the real trick like you just said Oliver is like yeah you're gonna get something before<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:13">0:54:13-0:54:18</a>:</strong>  you plant it you should know where you're gonna sell it if you have intention of selling<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:18">0:54:18-0:54:19</a>:</strong>  it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:19">0:54:19-0:54:23</a>:</strong>  Now before we wrap up today can both of you guys, well all three of you guys talk a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:23">0:54:23-0:54:27</a>:</strong>  bit about the things that you have on offer right now because there's a whole range of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:27">0:54:27-0:54:34</a>:</strong>  courses and you guys have started a cafe at Gran Jacyquin and Aptitlan Organics is working<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:34">0:54:34-0:54:35</a>:</strong>  in new realms as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:35">0:54:35-0:54:39</a>:</strong>  Talk a little bit about where you're headed in the future because I'm really looking forward<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:39">0:54:39-0:54:45</a>:</strong>  to catching up and doing some follow up on this when I have a chance to come back.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:45">0:54:45-0:54:47</a>:</strong>  Yeah I can lead.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:47">0:54:47-0:54:54</a>:</strong>  So definitely you know it's an interesting time right now the Aptitlan Organics farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:54:54">0:54:54-0:55:01</a>:</strong>  and then also Gran Jacyquin and we also have another farm that we work with Big Rock Farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:01">0:55:01-0:55:03</a>:</strong>  which is over in San Marcos.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:03">0:55:03-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  The three of us, the three farms and four of us that's including Haley who's not here<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:12</a>:</strong>  right now, the four of us are also collaborating on the teaching endeavors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:12">0:55:12-0:55:16</a>:</strong>  So we're not only looking for like the farm product cooperative but we're starting to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:16">0:55:16-0:55:22</a>:</strong>  dream up this vision of like what a teacher's cooperative would look like and it would probably<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:22">0:55:22-0:55:28</a>:</strong>  include not just courses both here and abroad but also possibly consulting services and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:28">0:55:28-0:55:31</a>:</strong>  other things that maybe Neil and Jeremy will mention a bit more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:31">0:55:31-0:55:35</a>:</strong>  But it's the same kind of set of questions how do we work together symbiotically at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:35">0:55:35-0:55:41</a>:</strong>  teaching level as well so you know I'm really excited that we now have a team of four solid<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:41">0:55:41-0:55:47</a>:</strong>  lead facilitators that are teaching intro to permaculture courses and also permaculture<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:47">0:55:47-0:55:48</a>:</strong>  design certification courses.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:55:48">0:55:48-0:55:53</a>:</strong>  So you can find information about all the permaculture trainings on aptitlanorganics.com<br />

<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:07">0:57:07-0:57:11</a>:</strong>  after about a year and a half of collaboration.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:11">0:57:11-0:57:18</a>:</strong>  We have a lot of work to do yet we're rebuilding our animal house we built it as a kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:18">0:57:18-0:57:23</a>:</strong>  a temporary structure and we're sort of building it around doubling down on the things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:23">0:57:23-0:57:31</a>:</strong>  we've seen working so we're making it more ample so there's more room for goats and we<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:31">0:57:31-0:57:40</a>:</strong>  can put more divisions in there and also rebuilding the structure so that it can have a flat deck<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:40">0:57:40-0:57:45</a>:</strong>  up above where we can have extra space for growing plants and maybe even like a hangout<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:45">0:57:45-0:57:51</a>:</strong>  area but also principally an area to dry coffee in coffee season.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:51">0:57:51-0:57:59</a>:</strong>  So that's like a big project we're finishing our post farmhouse as well there's quite a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:57:59">0:57:59-0:58:03</a>:</strong>  bit of work to do on that and we have like quite a bit of landscaping to do yet we have<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:03">0:58:03-0:58:15</a>:</strong>  a whole sort of zone two strokes three forest garden wetland that we're like midway through<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:15">0:58:15-0:58:18</a>:</strong>  doing the earthworks on now.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:18">0:58:18-0:58:24</a>:</strong>  So that's a it's a lot of work it's we're really excited about it and it's a it's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:24">0:58:24-0:58:33</a>:</strong>  great opportunity for long-term volunteer slash like apprenticeship or intern or leadership<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:33">0:58:33-0:58:38</a>:</strong>  kind of programs that we're like looking forward to because like we do have all this really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:38">0:58:38-0:58:42</a>:</strong>  interesting work going on right now and we're in that sort of like primary implementation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:42">0:58:42-0:58:47</a>:</strong>  phase you know so it's it's it's cool in a lot of ways it's it's a lot of work and we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:47">0:58:47-0:58:52</a>:</strong>  happy to open it up to people that are really like gung-ho to like get in on us.<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:52">0:58:52-0:58:57</a>:</strong>  We're excited about about that kind of like in a way symbiosis between the volunteer program<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:58:57">0:58:57-0:59:03</a>:</strong>  and the and the teaching program because yeah we really do feel like you know a stint at<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:03">0:59:03-0:59:08</a>:</strong>  at actually doing the hands-on work of implementing these systems in in conjunction with a course<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:08">0:59:08-0:59:13</a>:</strong>  is is a really I think good way to fast track your learning if you're passionate about this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:13">0:59:13-0:59:20</a>:</strong>  stuff and then the other thing we're super excited about is is the community reforestation<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:20">0:59:20-0:59:27</a>:</strong>  project it was a great you know shad in a lot of sense that already envisioned this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:27">0:59:27-0:59:34</a>:</strong>  project and then we spent a lot of time doing the first ones where we started doing week-long<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:34">0:59:34-0:59:40</a>:</strong>  volunteer programs where where people can come learn the basics of agroforestry and<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:40">0:59:40-0:59:47</a>:</strong>  and permaculture but we spend most of the time doing light earthworks and planting trees<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:47">0:59:47-0:59:55</a>:</strong>  on on local people's land which for us is like I guess the culmination of of like probably<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=0:59:55">0:59:55-1:00:01</a>:</strong>  between Shaddai and Jeremy maybe like 20 plus years of being Guatemalan and observing this<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:01">1:00:01-1:00:08</a>:</strong>  ecosystem and and realizing that coffee in a lot of ways holds could hold the key to<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:08">1:00:08-1:00:14</a>:</strong>  preserving this ecosystem because it is a shade tolerant forest crop and I'm really<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:14">1:00:14-1:00:19</a>:</strong>  inspired by like this vision of somehow being part of the development of kind of like a<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:19">1:00:19-1:00:26</a>:</strong>  community wide zone three commercial operation we're lucky that we collaborate with Tim who's<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:26">1:00:26-1:00:33</a>:</strong>  a coffee roaster and we're lucky that we we did build up good relations last year about<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:33">1:00:33-1:00:39</a>:</strong>  buying so much coffee from the community and we kind of have now like a list of names of<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:39">1:00:39-1:00:45</a>:</strong>  coffee producers who are very excited to have some soil conservation and and useful shade<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:45">1:00:45-1:00:52</a>:</strong>  trees planted on their land so that's another like endeavor that is is I think we're all<br />
<strong><a href="https://regenerativeskills.com/abundantedge-rrt15/#t=1:00:52">1:00:52-1:00:57</a>:</strong>  pretty excited about yeah it's super exciting and before we wrap up I just want to say to<br />
