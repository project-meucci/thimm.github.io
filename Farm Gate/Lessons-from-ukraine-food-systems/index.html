<p><strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:16</a>:</strong>  Hello, welcome to Farmgate, I'm Finnlow Costayne.  This programme is a little different. It's the recording of a webinar run by the Food  and Global Security Network called Lessons from Ukraine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:16">0:00:16-0:00:31</a>:</strong>  The webinar poses the question, what does Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the global  response to this war tell us about global food production and food systems more broadly?  The discussion took place on Zoom, which means that the audio quality is not quite up to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:31">0:00:31-0:00:45</a>:</strong>  our usual high standard and the programme has not been edited in the normal way.  That said, the quality, the insight from our guests was immense and I hope that you'll  take the time to listen to this conversation. Thank you for joining us. I'm Finnlow Costayne,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:00:45">0:00:45-0:01:00</a>:</strong>  the founder of the Food and Global Security Network. I'm joined today by a superb international  panel. Chantelle Weiyin-Clemol is the deputy director of IPES Food based in Brussels.  Juna Mikkola is the founder of Soil Watch and he comes from Finland and lives and works<br />

Sue Pritchard is the chief executive of the Food, Farming and Countryside  Commission based in the UK. And sadly, we were to be joined by Rekonaldo Hasid Marroquin,  but Rekhi has unfortunately been caught out in a storm in rural South Dakota and has no<br />

I'm going to lead the discussion with  our panelists, after which we'll go to you, the audience. So please put any questions  that you have into the chat box as we go along and feel free to introduce yourselves to each<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:30">0:01:30-0:01:49</a>:</strong>  other as well. So I want to set the scene. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is brutal and  unprovoked and it's correct that the international community has come to the aid of the Ukrainian  people. But the mainstream media narrative of good guys and bad guys, no matter how understandable<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:01:49">0:01:49-0:02:05</a>:</strong>  is unhelpful and oversimplifies important practical and ethical questions around conflict,  political motivations and the balancing of strategic global power. So we need to take  a step back to reflect on the origins of this conflict and a step forward, because this<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:05">0:02:05-0:02:24</a>:</strong>  war is almost certainly just a foretaste of the violence and insecurity to come in the  next few decades as ecological breakdown, access to food and geopolitical instability  become welded fundamentally together. President Putin is a megalomaniac, but he's not an idiot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:24">0:02:24-0:02:40</a>:</strong>  His economy is built on what seemed once to be the hard rock of fossil fuels. But climate  change has undermined these foundations and much needed global policy to reduce carbon  emissions will increasingly strand Russia's fossil fuel assets. The Russian economy has<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:40">0:02:40-0:02:58</a>:</strong>  therefore become vulnerable to ecological instability, and many more nations will find  themselves in similar positions to a lesser or greater extent. So we're now facing a great  geopolitical restructuring as national governments attempt to identify new economic strengths<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:02:58">0:02:58-0:03:14</a>:</strong>  and to capture control of alternative assets. After fossil fuels, Russia's next biggest  export is cereal. Russia was the world's third biggest producer of wheat in 2020. And if  it successfully claims Ukraine, which is the world's sixth biggest producer, it will control<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:14">0:03:14-0:03:33</a>:</strong>  up to 30% of the world's supply of this staple ingredient. Now, I want to be clear, I'm not  suggesting that Putin invaded Ukraine simply because of climate policy or the desire for  grain. What I am saying is that these are critical underlying elements that factor into<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:33">0:03:33-0:03:49</a>:</strong>  Putin's strategic thinking, and which will inevitably factor into the thinking of other  leaders in the future. Food ingredients, as a result of a distorted global food commodity  system, have tremendous economic value and are becoming critical strategic assets. Ownership<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:03:49">0:03:49-0:04:06</a>:</strong>  of these commodities and control over their routes to market, particularly transportation  pinch points, can be weaponised. And while access to nutrition helps to maintain social  stability, hunger, poverty and resentment can quickly lead people into conflict. Ecology,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:06">0:04:06-0:04:23</a>:</strong>  food and political stability have become intrinsically linked. So what does the current conflict  tell us about the state of the global food system today? And if, as we believe, agroecology  and regenerative agriculture are the long term solutions, then what does the rhetoric<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:23">0:04:23-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  from governments and farmers urging a return to the most intensive forms of farming as  a response to the Ukrainian conflict tell us about the political progress that we're  actually making? Let me come first to you, Junor, Michaela<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:53</a>:</strong>  from Soil Watch. The people living in the Sahel are some of the poorest in the world,  and food insecurity is already high. What's been driving this food insecurity over the  last few decades, and how has Russia's invasion of Ukraine made things worse?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:04:53">0:04:53-0:05:12</a>:</strong>  Yeah, thanks, Jindla, and thanks for the introduction and also for the opportunity of being here.  Yeah, it's actually quite an interesting and scary situation here, because as you said,  we've been facing worse in the food security situation here. COVID made it worse. It kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:12">0:05:12-0:05:33</a>:</strong>  of impacted the commodity supply chains, and now we have the Ukraine war as well. What  has been going on in the last couple of decades can maybe be called as a vicious circle of  land degradation. We have unsustainable agricultural practices and overgrazing and really quickly<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:33">0:05:33-0:05:50</a>:</strong>  growing both human and livestock population. That has led to basically a decrease in soil  organic batter in the farmlands. Traditionally, people used to practice here what is called  shifting agriculture, where they farm an area for a couple of years, and then they move<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:05:50">0:05:50-0:06:08</a>:</strong>  ahead and again abandon it, and then they cut down forests and the native vegetation.  What's been driving the food insecurity is actually land degradation drives it in two  ways. We have decreasing yields here, unlike most parts of the world where the yields have<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:08">0:06:08-0:06:28</a>:</strong>  been increasing in the past couple of decades. Also, less feed available for livestock, but  then that actually causes something similar to resource conflict. We have a more and more  pressure, bigger population over less and less natural resources, and that is driving<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:28">0:06:28-0:06:44</a>:</strong>  conflict across the area, across all Sahel. It's 7,000 kilometres from Senegal to Djibouti.  And then as there is more and more conflict, then there's more and more displaced people.  And then when people are displaced, they cannot produce food anymore. So, conflict is also<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:06:44">0:06:44-0:07:02</a>:</strong>  another driver of food insecurity. Correct me if I'm wrong, Gino, but the food  insecurity in the Sahel has increased, hasn't it, over the last two or three decades, partly  because of the entry into the global market, not only subsistence farming taking place<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:02">0:07:02-0:07:15</a>:</strong>  as it has done for decades and centuries before, but because people there have been entering  into the global market and selling into the global market.  Yeah, so partly for instance in Sudan, in the 70s, the livestock population was about<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:15">0:07:15-0:07:32</a>:</strong>  40 million heads, and now it's 140 million. Most of that goes as exports to the Gulf state.  And before a lot of people, they were producing food, keeping livestock also, it was a kind  of storage of wealth, and then for their own consumption. And when they were kind of connected<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:32">0:07:32-0:07:48</a>:</strong>  with the market economy, they started to increase the herd size as well. So, it's definitely  there as part to play. And then as well, also access to cheap commodities from abroad, from  the global market has also then led to really quick increase in population as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:07:48">0:07:48-0:08:03</a>:</strong>  And now what we're seeing now with the Ukrainian war, suddenly the seed commodities are not  there anymore. What happened last time when the wheat price went up, it caused the Arab  Spring in these areas. So, now in a very dire situation here at the moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:03">0:08:03-0:08:21</a>:</strong>  What sort of impacts on the ground have resulted from the Ukraine conflict?  So why it impacts so much all of Africa and North Africa is because, and maybe the Middle  East, these countries, they import a lot of wheat from Ukraine and from Russia. And then<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:21">0:08:21-0:08:42</a>:</strong>  also we have very large parts of the population. They live with a very couple of dollars per  day. So, when it doesn't really hurt us that much in the West, when let's say the bread  prices double, it does really hurt those people who most of their income really goes to buying,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:42">0:08:42-0:08:58</a>:</strong>  for instance, wheat. And that will, that last time that happened, it increased, it led to  the Arab Spring, a lot of popular unrest. And yeah, we are quite scared to see what  will happen in the coming months in this area.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:08:58">0:08:58-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  Now, Juno, just thinking about the food insecurity and the way that it's risen over the last  few decades, and now with this layering on top of this conflict in Ukraine, you've said  to me in the past that when you run out of old tricks, the things that we usually do,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:24</a>:</strong>  then you need new tricks. I just wonder what do you think those new tricks are and how  are donors and international agencies changing their approach to dealing with hunger in the  Sahara?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:24">0:09:24-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so yeah, we've been actually having a couple of meetings lately with the different  UN agencies and donors and trying to kind of brainstorm that what we can do now when  we don't have access to these cheap commodities. And obviously, then the most obvious answer<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:56</a>:</strong>  is that how can we increase the food production in these countries? And if you ask me, that  should be the focus from the first point. For a long time, there was kind of an idea  of some kind of a competitive advantage and that said that countries would be producing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:09:56">0:09:56-0:10:15</a>:</strong>  wheat and other countries would be importing it. But as we see now, there's maybe one more  focus on supply chain resilience, especially when it comes to food. So that's a really  good thing. And I would say that also, I work mainly with the land recorders and drivers<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:15">0:10:15-0:10:36</a>:</strong>  of land recorders. When you invest in sustainable food systems in these countries, you're not  only investing in food security, but it's also a climate act. When we produce more per  hectare, that means that there's lessened conversion of natural habitat into cropland.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:36">0:10:36-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  So that's a very positive direction that should have happened earlier. But I think now the  pressure is really piling up that the countries together with the donors, with the UN agencies  and even the private sector, we're looking at that how can we invest in sustainable food<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:11:07</a>:</strong>  production in these countries. Fantastic. Thanks so much, Junot. Let me  turn to you, Chantelle Weying-Clement from IPES Food. If this war is the beginning of  a geopolitical restructuring linked to ecological insecurity with food becoming not only a strategic<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:07">0:11:07-0:11:23</a>:</strong>  commodity but also a weaponized asset, how do food systems and food system governance  need to respond and change? Honestly, my first thought when I heard your  question was, you know, is this war the beginning of major global restructuring? You know, aren't<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:23">0:11:23-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  we just actually continuing patterns of geopolitics that have existed for centuries but with slightly  different players? I think food has been used, you said this rightly in the introduction,  it's been used as a strategic asset in many contexts before this one. You know, going<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:35">0:11:35-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  back to the sieges centuries ago to, you know, to today. And I think I was looking this up,  I think it was in 1974 that the USDA secretary coined the phrase, you know, food is a weapon  when US was shaping its foreign aid policy. So again, you know, these ideas far predate<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:12:02</a>:</strong>  where we are today. But, you know, fast forward to 50 years later and we're actually in a  very similar situation, just playing out against the backdrop of climate change, half a century  of globalization. So really, everything is just so much more amplified. But you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:02">0:12:02-0:12:15</a>:</strong>  in terms of how do food systems need to respond and change, I think a first step really is  a lot of the things that Jooma already said, it's really just to acknowledge that food  systems have been failing us far before this crisis started. And these failures are wrapped<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:15">0:12:15-0:12:29</a>:</strong>  up in these broader structural issues related to governance and power. You know, certainly  the invasion of Ukraine is what has sparked another food crisis or food price crisis.  And I'd specify that this is the third food price crisis in only 15 years. But you know,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:29">0:12:29-0:12:43</a>:</strong>  we know our food systems are part of a much bigger, much longer story about lack of access,  lack of distribution, poverty, debt. And I think the numbers from the UN Food and Agricultural  Organization report on food insecurity was just released this week. And it confirms all<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:43">0:12:43-0:12:58</a>:</strong>  of this, you know, the state of hunger and malnutrition in the world today, because of  COVID conflict, etc, are basically the same as they were in 2015. So 2015 2016, when we  created the UN Sustainable Development Goals to overcome these challenges, but that's extremely<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:12:58">0:12:58-0:13:12</a>:</strong>  troubling to think that in that amount of time, we've essentially achieved very little,  you know, our food systems really just shouldn't be this vulnerable to disruption. So I think,  you know, if the Ukraine conflict ended tomorrow, we'd still be facing some kind of global food<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:12">0:13:12-0:13:23</a>:</strong>  crisis because of something else, you know, our reliance on chemical inputs, because of  the impacts of our agricultural practices on natural resources on the soil, as was already  said, you know, because of ongoing health pandemics, there's always something around<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:23">0:13:23-0:13:35</a>:</strong>  the corner. And really, you know, because of the very structures, if I can use the C  word, you know, of capitalism, to be honest, you know, which is enriching some actors like  big grain traders, commodity speculators, input companies, and you know, these are being<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:35">0:13:35-0:13:48</a>:</strong>  furthered by our national governments, their agricultural trade and aid policies for decades,  you know, to the detriment of our world's most vulnerable populations, farmers included.  So again, first step, I think, let's just acknowledge that and take a really hard look<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:13:48">0:13:48-0:14:01</a>:</strong>  at the systems and the structures that are in place that got us here in the first place.  You mentioned there the reliance on chemical inputs, and, you know, the role of capitalism  and speculation. I just wonder if there are other sort of structural issues that you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:01">0:14:01-0:14:14</a>:</strong>  aware of at IPES. Yeah, I mean, I think Juma talked about an  important one, which is just dependence, you know, dependence on imports, and this logic  that has structured globalization around this kind of logic of export orientation, comparative<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:14">0:14:14-0:14:27</a>:</strong>  advantage, those kinds of things. So, you know, we talk, we can talk about speculation,  we can talk about debt, you know, perhaps at a later stage, but you know, it's again,  it's the global structures of how we, you know, how we shape trade agreements, how we<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:27">0:14:27-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  structure trade, how we structure humanitarian aid relief, as well as kind of part of all  of this. All that being said, there are some very practical and positive solutions happening  on the ground. But you know, these can only be scaled up and really be meaningful, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:40">0:14:40-0:14:55</a>:</strong>  know, if we look at this whole system that's really tamping down on these positive efforts.  Well, let's focus for a moment on that scaling, if you like, because each of us on this call  is involved in some way in the political effort to make agroecology mainstream. And so, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:14:55">0:14:55-0:15:10</a>:</strong>  guess the simple question is, when you're within this bubble that we live in, it feels  like we're making progress. But actually, when you start to see that progress sort of  dribbling away, perhaps as a result of the Ukraine conflict, the question is, are we<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:10">0:15:10-0:15:21</a>:</strong>  winning? And how is the war in Ukraine affecting the political argument for change at a European  Union level?  I think it's good to maybe remain a bit positive, because there's so much bad news going on<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:21">0:15:21-0:15:33</a>:</strong>  at the moment. But, you know, as we know, agroecology, it's not just a set of agricultural  practices, you know, it's a whole framing, it's a paradigm, it's really just a shift  in mindset of how we do food systems differently. You know, and this can be a really hard thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:33">0:15:33-0:15:47</a>:</strong>  to pitch to those in power who've been maintaining the status quo for decades. You know, but  at the same time, this is really a moment of opportunity, right? This crisis, or these  repeated crises have brought all this to light. So I like to think that on a global scale,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:15:47">0:15:47-0:16:00</a>:</strong>  we are slowly but surely gaining ground. I think before I get to the EU, you know, you  might have heard of the Agroecology Coalition, which was created last year in the aftermath  of the UN Food System Summit. That's a whole other topic. But, you know, this coalition<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:00">0:16:00-0:16:15</a>:</strong>  now brings together, I think, 34, 30 some governments and other actors willing to mainstream  agroecology. And unsurprisingly, many of these countries are countries from the global south,  you know, those who've been forced into a global system that doesn't work to their advantage.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:15">0:16:15-0:16:29</a>:</strong>  You know, I think in West Africa, we're seeing Senegal, Burkina Faso, Mali, really increasing  their focus on agroecological production. As a result of the crisis, we also just saw  Ghana announced a progressive shift towards organic fertilizers to curb rising input costs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:29">0:16:29-0:16:42</a>:</strong>  You know, if we look beyond grain, you know, which is really the main topic of this crisis,  we're seeing countries as well, many vulnerable countries who are actually self-sufficient  in local staple crops, like millet, like sorghum, you know, things that are climate resilient,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:42">0:16:42-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  locally adapted, locally consumed, you know, all of this kind of fitting under the umbrella  of agroecology. You know, and we can we can go elsewhere as well. But all around the world,  we're seeing these kind of pockets of opportunity and hope. In the EU, though, I think you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  right that we really saw, especially I think in March at the start of this crisis, these  two very opposing visions for food systems really being amplified by the crisis. Specifically,  I saw, unsurprisingly, it kind of came from the agricultural side or the agricultural<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:23</a>:</strong>  policy side, that we saw these real efforts from the agricultural commissioner to hold  off implementation of some of the EU's most sustainable food policies under the farm to  fork strategy. So things like questioning pesticide directives, questioning nature restoration<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:23">0:17:23-0:17:38</a>:</strong>  laws. And that was that was really worrying. But luckily, I think the commission vice president,  so Hans Timmerman, has really held his ground, I think, to preserve the EU's sustainability  ambitions, because he and his team are really thinking about long term resilience over short<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:38">0:17:38-0:17:54</a>:</strong>  term productivity. And I think, you know, that's that's not something to be taken lightly.  I think they agroecology was explicitly mentioned as a means to create long term resilience  to crises in communications from the Commission on safeguarding food security a few months<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:17:54">0:17:54-0:18:09</a>:</strong>  ago. And I think now we're seeing some of this language being backed up by the proposal  just put out by the commission last week, as part of the more specifics of the biodiversity  and farm to fork strategies, including legally binding targets, which is really how we get<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:09">0:18:09-0:18:23</a>:</strong>  anywhere. So that kind of thing is really exciting. But of course, you know, this is  just a proposal, it has to go to the parliament has to go to the council. So at this point,  it's really up to member states up to the parliament to stand up and support these ambitions<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:32</a>:</strong>  and not just torpedo the whole process and let things get watered down as as it goes  through the political process.  I agree with you that it's been really interesting to see and really and really positive to see<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:32">0:18:32-0:18:47</a>:</strong>  the response of the commission in the face of this, this attempt to slow progress around  farm to fork that they really have kind of held held to the line that they need to make  progress and think for the longer term. But I'm just just thinking about that, that sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:18:47">0:18:47-0:19:02</a>:</strong>  of coalition of agricultural interests that was that was pushing the commission to hold  off on the farm to fork. I'm wondering whether you see the Ukraine conflict, whether they  were simply being opportunistic and, and decided that this was a really good way of managing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:02">0:19:02-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  some PR and trying to, to advocate for the old status quo from the commission, or whether  they were coming from a position of genuine fear about the changes that were going to  come through the farm to fork strategy, whether they were genuinely nervous that farm to fork<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:32</a>:</strong>  wouldn't be able to deliver food for people in Europe.  Sure. I think firstly, to be honest, we're all using this as a kind of PR opportunity  to push for, you know, the values that we believe in. But I think there was genuinely<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:32">0:19:32-0:19:47</a>:</strong>  always some fear, I think, around the direction of the farm to fork strategy from some constituents,  specifically around productivity, specifically around yields, but really just because nobody  likes to shake up the status quo. And I think it's been interesting to hear the commission's<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:19:47">0:19:47-0:20:02</a>:</strong>  language around some of this because they are supporting agroecology. But this is coming  out alongside a lot of business as usual language as well. So a lot of talk about increasing  productivity, you know, sort of new breeds research into, you know, new technological<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:02">0:20:02-0:20:19</a>:</strong>  strategies for climate resilience. So a lot of this is being said, but in a pretty contradictory  way, because, you know, again, politically, I think you're trying to appeal to all audiences.  But I think, you know, from a lobbying perspective, perhaps, I think there was some real fear<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:19">0:20:19-0:20:31</a>:</strong>  that we are changing the models on which we're basing our systems at the moment. You know,  we're pointing to many things beyond this conflict, we can talk about livestock, we  can talk about monocultures, etc. These things are all being threatened by the commission's<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:31">0:20:31-0:20:46</a>:</strong>  current direction. So, you know, of course, of course, there is genuine fear that these  things will be phased out as we move forward. Sue Pritchard from the Food, Farming and Countryside  Commission in the UK. You're based here in Great Britain. What impact has the war had<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:20:46">0:20:46-0:21:02</a>:</strong>  on the political appetite for agroecology in Britain, do you think? And perhaps more  importantly, how do you think the war is affecting actual food production on the ground?  Thanks, everyone. Just really loving listening to Chantal and Juna just really cutting to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:02">0:21:02-0:21:23</a>:</strong>  the chase about what the what the big structural issues are. So I'm sure we'll talk more about  that shortly. Without a doubt, the war in Ukraine, and the conditions that Chantal has  already listed, before that has encouraged the kind of productivist mindset in the UK,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:23">0:21:23-0:21:43</a>:</strong>  those farmers and growers who have, you know, often for very, very good reasons. At their  absolute heart and soul, this desire to feed the world, that the point of them being farmers  is to, to feed the world and to feed the world as efficiently and as effectively as possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:21:43">0:21:43-0:22:06</a>:</strong>  In the last decade or so as the as the shift to more agroecological or regenerative paradigms  has started to really grow. Those farmers who are deeply rooted in the productivist  paradigm have perhaps struggled. Now, that that all being said, many of them, many farmers<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:06">0:22:06-0:22:29</a>:</strong>  have already made the kinds of changes that that shift towards more regenerative farming  practices, and therefore have alleviated some of the shocks that others have faced the rising  price of fertilizers and inputs, for example, energy costs, fuel costs. And so for those<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:29">0:22:29-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  who already made the transition, they are feeling very grateful, let's say that they've  already made those shifts. For farmers who have been waiting for clearer signals, clearer  policy signals from our own government, about the real direction of travel of farm policy<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:23:18</a>:</strong>  in the UK. They have, I think, started to take much stronger signals from the market.  And so for particular commodities, as both Shantal and Julia have already said, those  commodity prices are going sky high. And farmers who can are really trying to maximize their<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:18">0:23:18-0:23:35</a>:</strong>  production from their land holdings. So in my area, where I live in Wales, I farm in  Wales, where I live in Wales, when I go for a walk around the lanes now, I can see that  some of my neighbors are plowing right up to the hedges and right down to the stream<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:35">0:23:35-0:23:55</a>:</strong>  corridors. Whereas just last year, they'd left two meter boundaries, and riparian corridors  to protect habitats and to support wildlife corridors. Those environmental gains are already  lost.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:23:55">0:23:55-0:24:11</a>:</strong>  And why is that happening, Sue? Is it a response to Ukraine and the idea that they are suddenly  somehow responsible for, you know, all of the food that everybody eats around the world?  Or is it a response to transitions in environmental legislation in the UK arising, perhaps from<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:11">0:24:11-0:24:27</a>:</strong>  Brexit and the reorganization of the way that British farmers relate to the replacement  for the Common Agricultural Policy?  I think we're at a point in time where some of the taken for granted assumptions of what<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:27">0:24:27-0:24:49</a>:</strong>  kind of food system we need in the planet have been really challenged. And we are bringing  to fruition a new set of practices, but also principles and values about how food systems  should be in the future. They should not harm the planet, they should be more equitable,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:24:49">0:24:49-0:25:15</a>:</strong>  more inclusive, more fair. The principles that are embodied really well in agroecology.  But I think, again, Chantal named it very clearly. Even though we can point to all of  the detrimental effects that the old food system has had on land and on health, on water<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:15">0:25:15-0:25:36</a>:</strong>  quality, on air quality around the world, we have to be very cognizant of the fact that  there are still some very powerful beneficiaries of the current system. And as we work and  collaborate across agencies, across organizations, across nations to try and bring a new paradigm<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:36">0:25:36-0:25:57</a>:</strong>  into being, I think it would be naive of us not to recognize that the old world does not  die quietly. And a phrase I've been using quite a lot recently is that for all the work  that we talk about, about midwifing the new into being, using either public policy or<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:25:57">0:25:57-0:26:17</a>:</strong>  other tools and instruments, we also have to think really quite hard about hospicing  the old and helping the old world die more effectively. The old values, the old ideas,  the old ways of doing business, they have to be helped to come to an end really much<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:17">0:26:17-0:26:33</a>:</strong>  more quickly. And that's at the heart of conversations around what a just transition looks like.  I mean, just one slightly shocking stat that I was reminded of when I was preparing for  the conversation today. The sorts of things that we're talking about here and now are<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:33">0:26:33-0:26:56</a>:</strong>  being talked about in a very animated way at Davos just a few weeks ago. And David Beasley,  the United Nations World Food Programme lead, was pointing out the incredible urgency and  seriousness of the war in Ukraine on food security, on hunger, on starvation in particular<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:26:56">0:26:56-0:27:18</a>:</strong>  parts of the world. But alongside that particular burning platform, he reminded us that the  net worth of the richest, many of whom were at Davos, increased by 5.2 billion pounds  per day in the last year. 5.2 billion pounds a day. Now, one of the things that I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:18">0:27:18-0:27:42</a>:</strong>  we probably do need to come on to fairly quickly in this conversation is the willingness of  governments and of international governance arrangements to require that the wealthy pay  much more of their fair share to rebalance inequalities around the world. And that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:27:42">0:27:42-0:28:04</a>:</strong>  not that's not a kind of that shouldn't be that shouldn't be a kind of polite request  anymore. It should become an absolute requirement of of a civilised planet that the richest  don't have a voluntary option to pay appropriate taxes and appropriate contributions proportionate<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:04">0:28:04-0:28:17</a>:</strong>  to their wealth. They must be required to do so because anything else is just just outrageously  unfair.  So, I completely take that point. And Chantelle, I want to come back to you in just a moment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:17">0:28:17-0:28:31</a>:</strong>  But before I do, you were talking about the market. I'm just wondering, you know, whether  and perhaps this is what you were indicating that the way in which the war has pushed up  the prices of fertiliser and other things. If there are people who have been interested<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:31">0:28:31-0:28:47</a>:</strong>  in agroecology, but they haven't quite taken the plunge, do you think that this has helped  to create a market driven response that's positive in terms of delivering not only well,  delivering some environmental benefit as well as this challenge that you were talking about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:28:47">0:28:47-0:29:03</a>:</strong>  about farmers ploughing right up to the fence, etc.?  I think for some people it has. But I mean, the reality is that a transition to regenerative  practices doesn't happen overnight. So you just take out fertilisers from farms, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:03">0:29:03-0:29:20</a>:</strong>  will have a drop in yields. Now, you can absolutely mitigate that in a managed transition to more  generative practices using organic manures and different tilling practices. But the reality  is, if you're going to make a rapid change from one year to the next, you're going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:20">0:29:20-0:29:45</a>:</strong>  take a hit on yields. And so lots of farmers have been making real kind of accountancy  led decisions about the price they're anticipating getting for their arable crops next year,  and the massively increased cost of those inputs. So different farmers in different<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:29:45">0:29:45-0:30:14</a>:</strong>  places with different opportunities, different bank balances, frankly, different appetites  for risk are making different kinds of decisions, because the market signals are very erratic  at the moment. And certainly in the UK, our government has not yet given the clearest<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:14">0:30:14-0:30:29</a>:</strong>  form of leadership that it could in the transition from one set of farm support payments to a  new set of farm support payments, and also being prepared to tackle the additional issues  of food insecurity, food poverty, health, nutrition, wellbeing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:29">0:30:29-0:30:48</a>:</strong>  Chantelle, I want to come on to that issue of potentially taxing, you know, wherever  that money comes from, whether it's from the richest or wherever, and spending and where  that spending goes. And as we know, healthy living soil and a vibrant ecology are vital<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:30:48">0:30:48-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  for a nation's resilience and its strategic strength. And in response to the war, we've  heard an awful lot about increased military spending or increasing military spending.  But is it the case that genuine national defence and security should also require more investment<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:18</a>:</strong>  in agroecological food production and food system reform?  I mean, sure, absolutely. Of course, as we said earlier, food security is national security  to a large extent. And if we want agroecology to have any chance to thrive within the current<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:18">0:31:18-0:31:33</a>:</strong>  context or future context, we have to create the incentives to allow farmers to adopt agroecology,  as we said, diversify their production, protect lands, etc., reduce dependence on external  inputs. But yes, this is going to require major investment, major support. And the interesting<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:33">0:31:33-0:31:48</a>:</strong>  thing is, while financing is usually the tricky part of the conversation, we actually already  have, you know, we have that covered. I think the FAO report that I like to cite that was  released last year stated that 90% of the, I think, $540 billion spent on global agricultural<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:31:48">0:31:48-0:32:03</a>:</strong>  subsidies per year are harmful. They're harmful to people, they're harmful to the planet,  that's 90%. So, you know, redirecting even a fraction of that in the right direction  could have a huge impact. Subsidies and public policies can't keep locking us into these<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:03">0:32:03-0:32:15</a>:</strong>  systems that, you know, as I said, are failing us. And many, you know, including the EU that  I mentioned earlier, are starting to talk about this strategically in the context of  food security. And I think what's been interesting on this kind of finance part is that there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:15">0:32:15-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  also been a big push within climate debates to increase climate finance for agroecology,  climate finance for regenerative solutions. So, you know, looking ahead to climate negotiations  later this year, you know, beyond kind of the food crisis, I'm really hoping and suspecting<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:40</a>:</strong>  that there's going to be a lot more talk about climate finance for food systems change, and  specifically agroecology in those spaces. So, you know, perhaps another avenue of possibility  to support what we're doing. You know, but beyond that, I think we're, we've already<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:40">0:32:40-0:32:54</a>:</strong>  seen more support, you know, I mentioned the EU, but we just saw, I think last month, the  USDA announced an additional $300 million to support farmers to transition to organic.  This is a really small amount compared to the billions they're investing in, in other<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:32:54">0:32:54-0:33:04</a>:</strong>  types of agriculture. But you know, it's, it's a step in the right direction. So, I  think, you know, we just have to take these as wins and keep building from there.  And within that farm to fork strategy, there is, and the discussion around agroecology,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:04">0:33:04-0:33:22</a>:</strong>  rather than simply, you know, regenerative farm management, there is that conversation  where there is at least an ambition now to start trying to reconnect climate outcomes  with, with biodiversity outcomes, with social outcomes, and, and a sort of a redistribution<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:22">0:33:22-0:33:34</a>:</strong>  of money so that we're valuing smaller farmers as well as larger farmers. Is that right?  Yeah, absolutely. I think what you're saying is, is exactly on the mark that, you know,  we have to not just talk about better agricultural practices. You know, we already said, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:34">0:33:34-0:33:45</a>:</strong>  also about how we distribute food, improve income, you know, develop the right social  safety nets, so everyone can afford and access healthy foods. I think at the international  level, you know, that again, I'm stressing this again, that means talking about debt<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:45">0:33:45-0:33:58</a>:</strong>  relief, or even debt cancellation, because these vulnerable countries, they, they need  the funds to invest in the infrastructures and programs that are needed. You know, at  the national level, we can talk about ambitious anti-hunger programs. We've seen them in Brazil<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:33:58">0:33:58-0:34:11</a>:</strong>  in the past, you know, supporting local and regional markets, which has already been mentioned.  So really, we are talking about a system-wide revamp that, you know, needs financing, not  just, not just production methods. I noticed that we're, we're running on in<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:11">0:34:11-0:34:24</a>:</strong>  terms of time. So, I'm going to move on to the next issue. And Sue, just thinking about  the Arab Spring, where an increase in the price of bread led to, led just about coping  communities into protest and ultimately into revolution, and thinking about what's happening<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:24">0:34:24-0:34:42</a>:</strong>  in Sahel now, as Juno explained earlier, what should Western governments be doing right  now to alleviate pressure on global markets and on the world's poorest people?  So, it's very, very clear to me that Western governments need to take, take their responsibilities<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:34:42">0:34:42-0:35:03</a>:</strong>  really seriously in investing in sustainable and agroecological practices in those most  vulnerable countries. I think we're all very alert and anxious about some global initiatives  which turn their attention to the global south, but do so in an extractive and instrumental<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:03">0:35:03-0:35:30</a>:</strong>  way that how certain, certain corporates or certain institutions can incorporate countries  in the global south into a globalized food market by, by enticing them into that kind  of monoculture and, and commodity led set of systems. But I think in, in West Western<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:30">0:35:30-0:35:52</a>:</strong>  countries and in the global north, we absolutely have to be investing in the sorts of heterogeneous  farming practices and locally contextually relevant farming practices that enable countries  to have a better chance of feeding themselves. That's, that's a critical role for, for development<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:35:52">0:35:52-0:36:13</a>:</strong>  aid. At the moment, we're cutting our aid budget in the UK, which is horrifying and  shocking at a time when we need to be investing much more in the alleviating policies that  support countries who are experiencing not just the Ukraine impacts, but climate impacts.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:13">0:36:13-0:36:38</a>:</strong>  Again, Chantal and Juna listed those right at the start. We are, we are continuing on  a trajectory where crisis after crisis after crisis is the, is the future that was foretold  20, 30 years ago. This, this level of, of, of disruption and turbulence as a result of<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:36:38">0:36:38-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  the decisions that we didn't make then and are still failing to make now was it was what  what we expected. So it's incumbent, I think, upon governments in the global north to be  investing as, as a, as an absolute responsibility, kind of obviously kind of anti colonial responsibility,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:18</a>:</strong>  a reparations project to ensure that countries in the global south can meet their minimum  needs. And that actually does mean us in the global north, having some really hard conversations  with ourselves about how much planetary resources we're quite prepared to suck up and waste<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:18">0:37:18-0:37:40</a>:</strong>  for things that really on are not that important to the quality of our lives. So there's a  big conversation I think for us in the global north to have about how we, how we think about  demand and consumption, and, and how how far we're prepared to start introducing policies<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:37:40">0:37:40-0:38:01</a>:</strong>  that moderate demand, and that engage citizens in those really kind of straight conversations  that it's for us in the global north, it is our demand on the planetary resources that  is causing it's a direct cause of the crises that we are we're talking about here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:01">0:38:01-0:38:14</a>:</strong>  You've talked about investment a lot there, and you started talking there about market  forces and governments are always very reluctant to intervene in the market, at least they  say they are, even if, you know, interventions do happen. And so I want to see as we move<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:14">0:38:14-0:38:27</a>:</strong>  into this new era where fossil fuel economies are becoming stranded, where there is this  new scramble and taking Chantal's point that yes, you know, food has been at the centre  of conflict, resource conflict, you know, since the dawn of time, but it seems to me<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:27">0:38:27-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  that there is a resurgence around food as a result of the ecological breakdown that  we're seeing around us. What I'm wondering is how we can, either as individuals or, you  know, or as think tanks and NGOs, you know, within this conversation, what can we be doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:39:03</a>:</strong>  to increase a sense of food sovereignty, the importance of food sovereignty, to help to  decrease corporate and governmental power, so that universal access to good quality nutrition  becomes a foundation of peace and stability rather than something, which it is at the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:03">0:39:03-0:39:18</a>:</strong>  moment, that can be controlled and weaponised?  There's so much in that question there. And I'm just going to kind of quickly start out  with a quick comment that, you know, the idea that we are a kind of, you know, predatory<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:18">0:39:18-0:39:39</a>:</strong>  and aggressive species isn't entirely borne out by a more thoughtful reflection on our  history. For tens and tens and tens of thousands of years, humans were able to collaborate,  were able to work effectively together, were able to recognise that, you know, all of our<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:39:39">0:39:39-0:40:00</a>:</strong>  interests and our concerns are deeply, deeply interconnected and independent. So the story  that we've now told ourselves that we are, you know, we're aggressive and we're predatory  and it's a dog eat dog world and that's inevitable, it's an inevitable part of the human condition,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:00">0:40:00-0:40:16</a>:</strong>  I think really does need to be challenged. It does need to be confronted. That kind of  argument serves particular purposes. And so in a kind of odd way, I think one of the things  that we can be doing really effectively right now is changing the stories that we tell ourselves.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:16">0:40:16-0:40:42</a>:</strong>  About what is important to us as a species and how we can find ways of working together  much more collaboratively and much more thoughtfully for everybody's interests. So instead of us  kind of, you know, going along with this notion that, you know, unless we have really strong<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:42">0:40:42-0:40:55</a>:</strong>  mediating mechanisms, we'll just always be trying to grab what we can for ourselves.  We just ask ourselves some different questions, we tell ourselves some different stories about  what's possible. So I think in very practical terms, I think that means working much more<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:40:55">0:40:55-0:41:12</a>:</strong>  directly with citizens and citizens in communities and certainly just very quickly, the work  we've done at FFCC with 150 of the poorest communities in the UK with big local and local  trust demonstrates that absolutely clearly to me that with the right conversations, the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:12">0:41:12-0:41:29</a>:</strong>  right information, with the right data, people who are often experiencing great food insecurity  themselves are horrified and furious that their poverty is being weaponized to shore  up a particular version of the food system and want to see governments and business working<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:29">0:41:29-0:41:43</a>:</strong>  together much more effectively to create a much fairer, much more sustainable and much  more balanced food system that meets everybody's needs and looks after our planet.  Jason Vale That's great. And also just to mention to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:43">0:41:43-0:41:57</a>:</strong>  people that in terms of an introduction to the Big Local Project, there is a Farmgate  podcast, I'll give you the link for that, you know, in due course that we did with the  Food Farming and Countryside Commission outlining the Big Local Project and its importance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:41:57">0:41:57-0:42:12</a>:</strong>  It's a really good project. Juno, just finally coming back to you before we go to our audience.  There have been many food crises over our lifetimes. And, you know, we've talked about  three in the course of the last 15 years. This is just the latest. But from what you've<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:12">0:42:12-0:42:27</a>:</strong>  seen and from the conversations that you've had, from the conversations you've been involved  in with the World Food Programme and other agencies, do you feel hopeful that something  will change for the better as a result of this food crisis?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:27">0:42:27-0:42:43</a>:</strong>  Guillermo De Soto Yeah, absolutely. And I would maybe mention  that that's a result of two crises. It's the food crisis and the climate crisis. And it  is eventually it's just two sides of this coin of the same crisis, which is that we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:42:43">0:42:43-0:43:01</a>:</strong>  living beyond the boundaries of this of this planet. There's a pretty ecological economies  here say that poverty will be only made history if nature enters economic calculations the  same way we calculate buildings and infrastructure. So I think that's what's happening in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:01">0:43:01-0:43:18</a>:</strong>  air and development community. Instead of used to have these isolated interventions  of water and mitigating conflict and improving food security and not really having an integrated  strategy on what's going on on the ground. Why are we having why are we seeing more and<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:18">0:43:18-0:43:37</a>:</strong>  more conflict and worsening food security situation. And I feel because of these other  people are coming to realise that a lot of the humanitarian disasters that are happening  caused by environmental degradation, then it's quite clear that if you really want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:37">0:43:37-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  change something over long term, we need to take nature into account. So for instance,  what we're doing with the WFP, WFP traditionally used to be food, namely, you know, those purchase  from other countries and then disappeared into these poor countries. What we now looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:17</a>:</strong>  at the WFP is that how can we improve the food security and build stability in the in  the community level by restoring landscapes. So we kind of going back into the sustainable  governance of natural resources and then restoring ecosystems. And there we would be actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:17">0:44:17-0:44:38</a>:</strong>  addressing way more problems than just food security. Actually, land use it's it constitutes  30% of the world's carbon footprint. When would we we estimate that the cost of the  renewable energy we go down. So the land use probably be even bigger share of the carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:38">0:44:38-0:44:56</a>:</strong>  footprint and it should not be this is one of the few sectors which actually could be  a carbon sink. So all that is kind of coming together. What we are seeing in our work is  that we do believe that over time there will be price for carbon. This price will affect<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:44:56">0:44:56-0:45:13</a>:</strong>  that occur as you mentioned that will curve a demand on very high carbon products. However,  that will also create a massive financial vehicle for landscape restoration in these  countries where we work. It is already there. It's just pulling these things together. We<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:13">0:45:13-0:45:29</a>:</strong>  believe that over time climate finance will really be a very important vehicle for financing  sustainable development in these countries. And it's trying to make sure of course that  the carbon financing in and of itself doesn't create distortions around other forms of natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:29">0:45:29-0:45:46</a>:</strong>  capital and degradation of biodiversity in one way or another. And I think that the work  that you're doing in particular, Juna, you know, with the way that you're channeling  that finance in order that you can do broader natural capital restoration, the delivery<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:45:46">0:45:46-0:46:01</a>:</strong>  of agroecology and regenerative farm management in the Sahel is extremely interesting. And  thank you for that. Look, thanks so much to all three of you for those fantastic contributions.  I think we should go to our audience. We only have another sort of 12 or 13 minutes before<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:01">0:46:01-0:46:18</a>:</strong>  we need to draw to a close. I've got a question here from Nicky, which is, and I'm not sure  whether to send this to Chantal or Sue, so perhaps you can kind of wave a hand when you  decide. How do we address the market dependency for outputs as opposed to just inputs, for<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:18">0:46:18-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  example, synthetic fertilizers? Many farmers identified the development of markets for  their agroecologically produced products as being too slow to meet their demands to shift  farm businesses into shorter supply chains. So how do we address the market dependency<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:34">0:46:34-0:46:55</a>:</strong>  for outputs? Who wants to have a go? Sue?  So I think there are auspicious lines emerging in the government's, albeit very weak response  to the national food strategy. It talks about strengthening public procurement and local<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:46:55">0:46:55-0:47:15</a>:</strong>  supply chains. And so working with local governments and anchor institutions at a local scale over  a period, I think can be really, can be really fruitful. So one of the conversations that  we had in Wales as part of our own public procurement research policy was encouraging<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:15">0:47:15-0:47:38</a>:</strong>  those anchor institutions to enter into conversations with collaborative farmers or collective co-ops  of farmers and to shift contracts over, we said at the time, a seven year period. So  that first of all, farmers and cooperatives can gear up collectively to provide the quantity<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:47:38">0:47:38-0:48:00</a>:</strong>  of outputs that are needed, but also that the buyers can first of all, divest themselves  of their existing contracts with their standard suppliers, but also be more reassured that  the new arrangements would stand up to the particular demands of a big public procurement<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:00">0:48:00-0:48:17</a>:</strong>  initiative. So I think there are glimmers, there are glimmers of possibility starting  to show up in places around the UK. Thanks very much Sue. June, probably this  is one for you, which is how do you see the role of precision breeding in countering ongoing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:17">0:48:17-0:48:33</a>:</strong>  issues in global food supply chains? And I guess as well as precision breeding, perhaps  you should think about that more broadly in terms of the role of technology.  Yeah, to be honest, I haven't been working that much on precision breeding. Yeah, I mean,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:33">0:48:33-0:48:49</a>:</strong>  we definitely see here there's a couple of UN agencies which are developing a more drought  and higher temperature resistant varieties, which I say it's only needed. But yeah, to  be honest, I haven't been working very much on that myself.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:48:49">0:48:49-0:49:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I think it's a tough question maybe that I'm going to dance around, but when we  look at precision breeding, it may offer some benefits, I think in terms of short term resilience,  perhaps less input in energy use, maintaining yields, things like that. But again, from<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:03">0:49:03-0:49:16</a>:</strong>  our perspective, we have to look at the context in which these technologies are being developed.  Does precision breeding mean it's going to be the same handful of companies guiding the  direction of our food systems? Does this kind of innovation mean it's going to keep taking<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:16">0:49:16-0:49:32</a>:</strong>  public funds away from diversification from protecting biodiversity? Does it mean maintaining  monoculture crop systems, huge industrial livestock systems, which, again, ultimately  aren't so natural and aren't able to provide sustainable livelihoods for farmers? Maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:32">0:49:32-0:49:47</a>:</strong>  one thing is that with some colleagues, we recently looked at the uptake of any innovation  to be considered against the 13 principles of agroecology that were outlined by the FAO.  Just to maybe use that as a benchmark to look at when we're thinking about adopting a technology,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:49:47">0:49:47-0:50:01</a>:</strong>  is it really delivering on all the co-benefits that agroecology proposes, beyond productivity?  Is it working on environmental grounds, socio-economic grounds, cultural grounds? And I think when  we look at it from this broader framing, it really helps us assess whether a technology<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:01">0:50:01-0:50:16</a>:</strong>  is helpful or not for the long term. This next question is quite UK centric, but  I think we could sort of take it in terms of the UK, but also in terms of the European  Union and the way that farm to fork strategy might work. And the question is, by what mechanisms,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:16">0:50:16-0:50:34</a>:</strong>  and most importantly, in terms of the question for me, on what timescale could the desired  level of taxation that Sue talks about be delivered? What's the ideal transition time,  I guess, from where we are now to where we need to be if those finances were to be shifted?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:34">0:50:34-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  Well, 2030 is a critical point in time, isn't it? But that's not, you know, waiting until  2030 to try and get everything done in the last year or 18 months or so. It is starting  to put mechanisms in place right now so that by 2030, we've created more promising conditions<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:51:19</a>:</strong>  to be able to tackle these huge issues that we're describing here. I mean, I don't really  want to give a glib answer. It's too easy to do that. We haven't got much time. But  what is clearly needed is much more energy invested in shareholder action and ensuring<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:19">0:51:19-0:51:42</a>:</strong>  that shareholders are able to consider a whole raft of considerations, not just shareholder  value, super national actions where the European Union had been doing some really good work  on this to make sources of funds and locations of funds much more transparent, much less<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:51:42">0:51:42-0:52:03</a>:</strong>  opaque is another step in that direction. And I think perhaps the third thing relates  again to working directly with citizens, doing everything we can to work directly with citizens  so that we reveal for citizens much more of what is fundamentally a very opaque food system<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:03">0:52:03-0:52:25</a>:</strong>  where the kind of risks are taken by citizens and primary producers very often, but all  of the rewards are being sucked up by this sort of invisible middles and global multinationals,  but often speculators, people who are speculating on the financialisation of food. So bringing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:25">0:52:25-0:52:43</a>:</strong>  much more transparency to citizens in the global north about what's really going on  and inviting them to not just change their purchasing habits in a supermarket, but change  how they vote, how they vote for governments who are prepared to tackle those big structural<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:43">0:52:43-0:52:59</a>:</strong>  issues. This is probably the final question that we'll  deal with today. And I think it might be one that it's worth each of you having a bit  of a go at and just summarising any points that you have for the end. And the question<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:52:59">0:52:59-0:53:14</a>:</strong>  is, can panellists comment on how looking at the climate ecosystem food breakdown issue  through the lens of water and the hydrological cycle as opposed to carbon only would change  our emphasis on these solutions? I can comment from this. So what I'm doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:14">0:53:14-0:53:32</a>:</strong>  and what I'm researching is the sustainable management of semi-arid arid lands. So obviously  water is a big limiting factor there. I think how it changes the climate action is that  it's actually the start that we realise that there's a water crisis, that it's actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:32">0:53:32-0:53:50</a>:</strong>  the extra addition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. It's just the tip of an iceberg.  We have a way bigger problem down there. It's a collapse of biodiversity. We are losing  here in Sahel, for instance, we have massive areas of land. We're completely wiping off<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:53:50">0:53:50-0:54:11</a>:</strong>  biomass on top of that land. We're wiping off the rooting system. We're wiping off the  soil organic carbon. So that means when it rains, the water doesn't stay in that landscape.  So they're completely combined, the climate crisis and the water crisis. And then again,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:11">0:54:11-0:54:25</a>:</strong>  for instance, I work with climate action. There are a lot of people getting an engineering  approach on climate crisis saying, let's just build a machine which will suck down  carbon from the atmosphere. And then there's more, let's say more system thinking people<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:25">0:54:25-0:54:44</a>:</strong>  saying, no, that's probably not going to solve the problem that we have. The extra carbon  in the atmosphere, it's just an indication that we are tipping off the planet of its  balance of the biodegradable cycles. I think that taking water into account, it will maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:44">0:54:44-0:54:56</a>:</strong>  channel more attention towards landscape and nature. And I think that's the right way to  go.  Yeah, I think I think Juna said it all. We're mostly systems people here in this virtual<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:54:56">0:54:56-0:55:10</a>:</strong>  room, not silver bullet solutions people. So I don't think a single metric is ever the  solution, whether it's carbon, methane, perhaps water. And again, coming from a policy perspective,  I think there's no reason we should be having these conversations separately. We have different<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:10">0:55:10-0:55:24</a>:</strong>  UN institutions or UN forums dealing with biodiversity, with climate, with desertification,  with soils. These are all part of the same problem. So we know these things are interlinked  and making that effort from the local to the global level to connect these issues is how<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:24">0:55:24-0:55:34</a>:</strong>  we get to somewhere more sustainable.  Absolutely. And it was a point that Christiana Figueres, who was championing the Paris Agreement,  made in one of the podcasts that we did again with the Food Farming and Countryside Commission,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:34">0:55:34-0:55:47</a>:</strong>  wasn't it, Sue? That one of the biggest mistakes the UN had made was separating out these processes,  these environmental processes 30 years ago, when actually the effort now needs to be to  reintegrate them. Sue, any final thoughts from you?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:55:47">0:55:47-0:56:02</a>:</strong>  Just absolutely agreeing with everything everybody's saying, including in the chat, and perhaps  just strengthening my current obsession, which is finding ways of engaging citizens in some  of these big and complex issues, because I know that they are interested. People do care<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:02">0:56:02-0:56:23</a>:</strong>  about these things, and finding the ways to talk about these complex interconnected issues,  and through my experience, through the lens of food, because we all eat food, can be very  powerful, very engaging, very involving, and can motivate citizens to work then not just<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:23">0:56:23-0:56:37</a>:</strong>  on food and food issues, but also on all of the other interconnected resilience building  issues that we know we're going to need a lot more of in the future.  Thank you. That's all we've got time for. I think that's been a fascinating hour. If<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:37">0:56:37-0:56:50</a>:</strong>  you haven't yet had the chance to read the Food and Global Security Network's report,  Soil Health, a Security Threat Profile, may I urge you to do so. There are chapters in  there from one or two people in the audience, as well as from at least two of the panel<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:56:50">0:56:50-0:57:07</a>:</strong>  members that we have today. There's some really interesting stuff. You can find it and the  webinar from its launch on our website, foodandsecurity.net. I'd like to thank our superb panellists, Sue  Pritchard, Juna Mikkola and Chantal Huay-Yin Klimok. I'm sorry that we can't hear an applause,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Lessons-from-Ukraine-food-systems-e1kvdat#t=0:57:07">0:57:07-0:57:22</a>:</strong>  but I'd ask you to give them a hand. And of course, thank you to you too, wherever you  are in the world, for taking the time to be with us this afternoon. I've been Finn Lo-Kustain.  This was Lessons from Ukraine for the Food and Global Security Network. Thank you for<br />
