<p><strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:20</a>:</strong>  Hello, welcome to Farmgate. I'm Finnlow Kastain, the Chief Executive of Farmwell and  founder of the Food and Global Security Network. It had been hoped that COP26 would be the  COP where food systems, soil and agriculture would finally make it to the top negotiating<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:20">0:00:20-0:00:36</a>:</strong>  table. From this perspective at least, Glasgow's Conference of the Parties on Climate Change  was not a success. But as discussed in the last programme, food systems, soil and agriculture  did at last emerge as key themes at side events inside the COP Conference Village, a prelude<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:36">0:00:36-0:00:54</a>:</strong>  one can hope to serious discussion at COP27 and 28. And the Glasgow Food and Climate Declaration,  initiated by Nourish Scotland and IPES Food, was a key factor in pushing this focus on  food systems up the policy agenda. The declaration is a commitment for sub-national governments<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:00:54">0:00:54-0:01:09</a>:</strong>  to tackle the climate emergency through integrated food policies, as well as a call on national  governments to act. It's supported by the FAO, the Food and Agricultural Organization  of the UN, and by international non-governmental organisations such as WWF and the Carbon Neutral<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:09">0:01:09-0:01:25</a>:</strong>  Cities Alliance. The declaration has been signed by the Scottish government and by local  authorities from around the world, from Bristol to Milan, from Equisigo to Lyon, from Valencia  to Istanbul and Vancouver. Today, I'm joined by Pete Ritchie, the Executive Director of<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:25">0:01:25-0:01:40</a>:</strong>  Nourish Scotland, and by Chantelle Clement, Deputy Director of IPES Food. Welcome both.  Chantelle, can I come to you first and start with the background to the Glasgow Food and  Climate Declaration. Where did it come from and what is it that sub-national governments<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:40">0:01:40-0:01:50</a>:</strong>  are signing up to do?  Firstly, thanks so much for having us and for the introduction on what the Glasgow Declaration  is all about. As you said, the climate cop is really the formal moment when governments<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:01:50">0:01:50-0:02:02</a>:</strong>  have the opportunity to develop ambitious national commitments to tackle climate change.  For years now, there's been this growing momentum to link food systems to those discussions,  given their role, of course, in being either part of the solution or a huge part of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:02">0:02:02-0:02:12</a>:</strong>  problem.  The Glasgow Food and Climate Declaration was in part a response to that, really just to  make food a bigger part of the global climate agenda. The specific entry point that IPES<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:25</a>:</strong>  Food, Nourish Scotland, and our many partners identified was that while national governments  may be dragging their feet to actually implement ambitious climate plans, sub-national and  local authorities are definitely not. It's really often at the local and the regional<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:25">0:02:25-0:02:36</a>:</strong>  levels that we're seeing some of the most exciting work being done to transform our  food systems, not just to make them more climate resilient and climate mitigating, but to bring  about a whole host of other benefits as well that I'm sure we'll talk about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:36">0:02:36-0:02:49</a>:</strong>  Really, I think the problem is when national governments are making commitments around  food, which are really few and far between, they're focusing primarily on agricultural  production and land use specifically. But we are seeing at the sub-national level that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:02:49">0:02:49-0:03:03</a>:</strong>  they're taking a much more systemic approach to the problem by developing integrated food  policies that not only aim to tackle those areas, but other aspects of the system as  well. So things like food waste, land use, access, diets, environmental justice, and<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:03">0:03:03-0:03:15</a>:</strong>  really a whole host of other issues as part of this comprehensive strategy. And again,  it's really just at the local level that we're seeing the most recognition for all of these  issues, the interconnection between them, and this acknowledgement that we have to address<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:15">0:03:15-0:03:27</a>:</strong>  them together if we really want to solve the climate emergency.  So concretely, the Glasgow Food and Climate Declaration was a call to action. It was also  a statement really just to recognize local action in tackling climate change because<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:27">0:03:27-0:03:39</a>:</strong>  they just haven't been getting the support and the recognition they deserve in these  global spaces. And of course, the declaration also called on national governments to really  just step up and to take the role of food and farming as seriously as local authorities<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:39">0:03:39-0:03:49</a>:</strong>  are. And of course, in signing on, local authorities committed to renew their commitments by following  through on their own integrated food policies. And I think the hundred or so cities that  actually joined us at COP was really a testament to that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:03:49">0:03:49-0:04:03</a>:</strong>  World Finance and Peter, I wonder if you could build on what Chantal's just said there. The  declaration itself notes that cities and regions are leading the way in pioneering these integrated  food policies at local level, to drive the food system change that you want to see. And<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:03">0:04:03-0:04:14</a>:</strong>  I just wonder if you could give us some examples of what's already happening.  Yeah, no, absolutely, Finlow. And Chantal's right, this is about implementation. Some  of the practical things that local authorities are doing are actually to deliver on a more<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:14">0:04:14-0:04:27</a>:</strong>  sustainable food system. And that will vary depending on the local authority, its powers,  and what's the most important thing for its citizens and its politicians. So in Quito,  for example, there's a big effort to make the food system more resilient, and to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:27">0:04:27-0:04:41</a>:</strong>  able to source more of the food for the city from within the region. That's been a key  issue in Covid, as we've seen a lot of cities turn around and say, where does our food come  from anyway? And realising that there's no local supply chains to feed the city. Then<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:41">0:04:41-0:04:53</a>:</strong>  you've got Malmo being at this for a long time. You know, the last 10 years they've  reduced their greenhouse gas emissions to their food system by 30%. They've increased  their organic procurement to 70%. You know, clear practical action. And then we've got<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:04:53">0:04:53-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  really small cities like Morinot-sur-Tout in France, gone 100% organic in their canteens  just by taking action locally and saying, we can fix this. Catalonia has got a new food  strategy where it's linking the urban and rural dimensions and saying, we have to connect<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:20</a>:</strong>  these things because we've got a strong demand from urban consumers for agro-cological products.  But we need to make that real in terms of how we transform our land use system. São  Paulo is joining the dots between organic healthy farmers, convert to organic within<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:20">0:05:20-0:05:33</a>:</strong>  the city boundaries, preserving the rainforest as part of their city, and increasing livelihoods  for those farmers and getting their produce to market. And then much closer to home, we've  got Fife is already linking farmers into local procurement. We've got Bristol tackling food<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:33">0:05:33-0:05:43</a>:</strong>  waste. We've got London banning junk food adverts, and all of these different practical  actions where local authorities are using the powers they do have to push integrated  food systems along.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:43">0:05:43-0:05:57</a>:</strong>  World Finance, you talk there about the power of local authority procurement in the same  way that we think about government procurement, and the way in which they can say, well, in  our canteens, or perhaps in our schools, we can try and source food locally. But I'm wondering<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:05:57">0:05:57-0:06:16</a>:</strong>  how cities contribute to bringing food in that's grown around the region of that authority  area. How they change the market dynamics, if indeed they can, to bring more food in  to local markets, and to get that food distributed within areas of the city that aren't directly<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:16">0:06:16-0:06:30</a>:</strong>  related to the local authority itself – the buildings that they own.  Sure. And I mean, Leon's a very good example of that, where they're supporting farmers  in the region to bring their produce into – not into schools, but into community centres<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:30">0:06:30-0:06:43</a>:</strong>  and markets, in the less affluent parts of the city, and actually subsidising those farmers'  markets and that produce to make that more available to people. So cities can do more,  but it's really important to recognise that public procurement, public food, does two<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:43">0:06:43-0:06:56</a>:</strong>  really important things. One, it normalises, if you like, a more sustainable diet. It says  this is something that everybody can eat. We can all shift a little bit towards more  plant-based diets. We can all shift a bit towards less processed food, more local products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:06:56">0:06:56-0:07:09</a>:</strong>  And the other thing is, it does send a market signal. It's really important to recognise  the market signal that government and local authorities send when they change public procurement.  And we saw that most notably, obviously, in Copenhagen, where their decision to go organic<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:09">0:07:09-0:07:24</a>:</strong>  in their public food, you know, actually underpinned the whole organic revolution in Denmark.  And does this generally depend on one or two really motivated people at local government  level? Or is there a more strategic approach that you're starting to sort of witness around<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:24">0:07:24-0:07:33</a>:</strong>  the world where this issue is just on the agenda and it's as talked about as bin collection  or street lighting?  Ian Mayne I think it varies from city to city. I mean,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:33">0:07:33-0:07:46</a>:</strong>  there's absolutely no doubt that in the South Park, this is at the very top level of the  city's priorities and the most senior people were represented in the discussions around  the Glasgow Declaration. Similarly in Bristol, at the launch, we had the deputy mayor come<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:46">0:07:46-0:07:58</a>:</strong>  and talk. And it's absolutely clear in Bristol that food policy is high up the council's  agenda. It's a core part of their circular economy, their climate change, they're making  Bristol a green city, you know, it's not shoved away in a back pocket somewhere. In other<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:07:58">0:07:58-0:08:12</a>:</strong>  cities, it's a second order issue. But I think what's happening is that we're seeing it more  and more become a first order issue. And things like the Glasgow Declaration can help cities  see that putting food up the agenda gives them that sort of wider voice on the international<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:12">0:08:12-0:08:25</a>:</strong>  stage. Also, as they see other cities doing things, they start to make the connections  to their own climate change plans, their own attempts to improve children's health, reduce  inequities and the need for food banks, they start to see food policy, integrated food<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:25">0:08:25-0:08:30</a>:</strong>  policy as a first order issue.  David Pembroke Chantelle, do you have thoughts on that as  well?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:30">0:08:30-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  Chantelle Mancuso Yeah, I was going to pick up on your idea  that you know, there's always one or two key people who really set the motion for things  to happen. And I would say that despite I think all of the very relevant things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:50</a>:</strong>  Pete just said, champions are definitely a key enabler that we've seen across the board.  Only to get things started. So when cities are sort of more at the beginning of their  food systems journey and developing a strategy, having those key people within the municipal<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:08:50">0:08:50-0:09:02</a>:</strong>  authorities is crucial. But I would also add that another key enabler is not just the champions  who are within the government, but the residents and the organizations who have sometimes been  working on these issues for years, if not decades. I'm thinking of some of the cities,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:02">0:09:02-0:09:14</a>:</strong>  Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, were talking to us about some of these volunteer food policy  councils that have been operating for again, a couple decades that eventually become sort  of more officially recognized and then work very closely with municipal authorities to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:14">0:09:14-0:09:28</a>:</strong>  really get things going. So I think we really shouldn't underestimate not just the power  of residents themselves in making things happen, but especially in the collaborations between  municipal authorities and some of these organizations working on the ground. And as Pete was mentioning,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:28">0:09:28-0:09:40</a>:</strong>  certainly during COVID, we saw that significantly. Sao Paulo is another great example for that  New Haven as well. These citizen groups working with the municipal council just to allow for  redistribution of food, especially to get to more marginalized groups during the pandemic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:40">0:09:40-0:09:53</a>:</strong>  That was a huge advantage when they work together.  It's interesting you mentioned marginalized groups there, because I was just wondering  about whether there is a distinction between the ability to change and reform poorer communities<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:09:53">0:09:53-0:10:08</a>:</strong>  that are more dependent on those sort of relationships with local authorities to supply food that's  coming into those communities. You know, local authorities are working with food banks, they're  working with people who are in poorer communities, and they're not necessarily working directly<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:08">0:10:08-0:10:18</a>:</strong>  with people in more affluent communities who just go to Waitrose and buy what they always  buy.  When you look at the pattern of all the family food survey stuff, all the data, what you'll<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:18">0:10:18-0:10:31</a>:</strong>  find there is that if you try distinguishing those dietary intakes, people will tend to  eat about the same amount of the stuff that we think is bad for you. And what's different  is that more affluent people are able to eat more of the stuff that's good for you, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:31">0:10:31-0:10:44</a>:</strong>  know, so more fruit and vegetables, more nuts, a little bit more protein, but not meat protein.  So you know, it's not as if people have hugely different diets here. But I think what local  authorities can do, we were just hearing an example of that yesterday from Lancaster,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:44">0:10:44-0:10:59</a>:</strong>  quite a small town in the UK, where the council is just going out to ordinary restaurants  and saying, look, could you be a bit more plant based here, and councils can do that  in a way, particularly if they're relatively small, they can create a sort of city feel,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:10:59">0:10:59-0:11:12</a>:</strong>  which is look, why don't we all eat a bit more plant based food and Bruges and Ghent,  I think in Belgium, both are good examples of that. There's other councils which have  tried a meat free Monday or veggie Thursday that goes beyond just what they do in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:12">0:11:12-0:11:22</a>:</strong>  schools and says, look, why don't we all take a day off meat? Why do we all really eat our  veggies this day?  And that's not necessarily about telling people that meat in its in and of itself is a bad<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:22">0:11:22-0:11:36</a>:</strong>  thing to eat, but it's about trying to provoke greater diversity in the diet overall.  Absolutely, yeah. And just saying, eating a wider range of things being a bit more imaginative  and what we what we put on our plates, you know, it's good for health, and it's also<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:36">0:11:36-0:11:49</a>:</strong>  good for the planet, and it's good for nature. And I think cities and local government can  get away with setting that sort of tone, which certainly in the UK sometimes feels bringing  that simply from national government can actually create a little bit of sense of resistance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:11:49">0:11:49-0:12:02</a>:</strong>  Chantelle, that kind of brings us on to the next subject that I wanted to discuss and  that the declaration centred on the need to support action on global warming. But the  text acknowledges some of the complexity of the challenge, which we were, you know, we<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:02">0:12:02-0:12:17</a>:</strong>  were starting to get into then, whether it's discussions about, you know, meat or not meat,  the amount of diversity that's in people's diets. And the declaration talks about food  systems contributing between 21 and 37% of total greenhouse gases. Now, that's an enormous<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:17">0:12:17-0:12:32</a>:</strong>  level of variance. And not only that, but in the same sentence, it's talking about the  impact that food systems have on biodiversity loss, hunger and malnutrition, and the escalating  public health crisis. And I wonder if you think that this complexity that's inherent<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:32">0:12:32-0:12:46</a>:</strong>  in the food system is why national governments and international processes are so reluctant  to bring food systems to places like the cop top table?  I think for starters, nobody likes complexity, to be honest, at least of all policymakers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:46">0:12:46-0:12:58</a>:</strong>  And to be fair, that's really a practical issue, because it seems, you know, just much  easier to tackle singular issues with simple targeted solutions than it is to change, you  know, the very foundations of what we've been doing for decades. You know, we said this<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:12:58">0:12:58-0:13:10</a>:</strong>  already, food systems are inherently complex. And if we just start talking about that percentage  that you were mentioning of how food systems contribute to climate change, there's this  huge variance, because there are these major discrepancies in what people choose to include<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:10">0:13:10-0:13:21</a>:</strong>  in their calculations. I mean, looking perhaps just at that calculation alone, you have to  look at greenhouse gases coming from all the different points in the value chain, you know,  from production, which also includes all the energy to produce all the inputs that go into<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:21">0:13:21-0:13:36</a>:</strong>  conventional systems, land use, processing, packaging, distribution, retail, consumption,  post consumption, you know, how do you calculate the energy use behind all of those things,  and actually properly acquire the data on a global scale to do that it's a huge undertaking,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:36">0:13:36-0:13:48</a>:</strong>  you know, that's when we're only talking about greenhouse gas emissions. And then you said,  you know, we need to think of all the spillover effects, each of those nodes in the food systems  also have beyond greenhouse gas emissions on the environment, biodiversity, communities,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:13:48">0:13:48-0:14:01</a>:</strong>  food and farm workers, you know, etc, etc. So, again, I think the reason we focus the  declaration on developing integrated food policies is for us to recognize that policies  need to be coherent, they need to be aligned across all these different policy areas to<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:01">0:14:01-0:14:13</a>:</strong>  affect food if we really want to develop real solutions, if you know, if we're only tackling  one aspect of the food system, say, you know, solely reducing carbon emissions related to  production, specifically, we're not looking at issues of packaging or distribution, we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:13">0:14:13-0:14:25</a>:</strong>  not even thinking about whether foods we're producing are even healthy, nutritionally,  or contributing to soil and water health. Again, there's going to be a lot of policies  we develop in total contradiction to each other, if we don't look at things coherently,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:25">0:14:25-0:14:37</a>:</strong>  I think one great example that some of our partners were looking at was that they were  showing that by just looking at diets and food waste as part of national climate plans,  we could reduce food systems emissions by a quarter. But again, we're missing out on<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:37">0:14:37-0:14:49</a>:</strong>  all these benefits that we could be leveraging, because we're not looking at issues together.  You mentioned, you know, the way in which food systems are complex, and the government's  naturally run scared of them. And when we think about the transport transition, or we<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:14:49">0:14:49-0:15:04</a>:</strong>  think about the renewables transition, the energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables,  there's a degree to which if governments can be successful in inspiring a relatively small  number of people in a relatively small number of boardrooms in a relatively small number<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:04">0:15:04-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  of companies, we can make that transition and we can make it relatively rapidly. Whereas,  you know, when it comes to food systems, I mean, just from the farmer end, we're talking  about hundreds of millions of farmers around the world before we even sort of get to, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:31</a>:</strong>  know, the people who are working in processing and retailing and PR and all that sort of  stuff. So, I guess it's not surprising that governments do run scared of this, but we're  at the point now where the low hanging fruit, there are processes in place there, and they've<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:31">0:15:31-0:15:42</a>:</strong>  really got to tackle this, but they've got to tackle it in the right way and not just  decide, right, we're going to go on with food systems. We're going to approach this from  a land sparing perspective. We're going to have more forests. We're going to squeeze<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:42">0:15:42-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  agriculture into ever smaller spaces. They've got to take hold of that complexity.  Yeah, they absolutely do. And a lot of the mechanisms for doing that will be through  national food plans. But we think that these local food plans, local integrated food policies<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:11</a>:</strong>  should co-create the national food plans. And that's because some of these, you know,  the most complex thing is about changing patterns of habits and behaviours that we have. And  that involves trust. You know, you don't have to change anything to change from a diesel<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:11">0:16:11-0:16:26</a>:</strong>  car to an electric car. If you're going to change what you eat, how much food you waste,  you have to change pretty much ingrained habits and patterns of behaviour, which suit you  very well at the moment. That's why you do them. So, you're asking citizens to actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:26">0:16:26-0:16:39</a>:</strong>  make personal changes, whereas switching your house from hydrogen gas to hydrogen doesn't  make any difference in how often you put the heating on. You just feel a bit more virtuous  about it. So, I think these are complicated. And that's why the trust that people have<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:39">0:16:39-0:16:53</a>:</strong>  in local government is really important in this process. But I think Chantal is absolutely  right. People do shy away from complexity. And what's interesting in the last five or  ten years is that we've now seen some of those bigger food businesses that you talk about,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:16:53">0:16:53-0:17:07</a>:</strong>  some of the multinational corporations, as well as some of the UK retailers in particular,  say this is a big issue. We do have to tackle it systemically. Tesco very recently came  out and said food is 30% of greenhouse gas emissions, 60% biodiversity loss. We have<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:07">0:17:07-0:17:19</a>:</strong>  to step up to the plate on this. So, I think there is a genuine realisation among food  businesses that the business is usually not an option in the food system. I do think national  governments are slower to come to that table. And it's partly because trade policies are<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:19">0:17:19-0:17:32</a>:</strong>  driven by agricultural exports and there's a sort of focus on that. And equally, Chantal  says, if you just focus on carbon, then absolutely it makes sense to have intensive chicken operations  rather than extensive ruminant operations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:32">0:17:32-0:17:46</a>:</strong>  I want to come back to Chantal on metrics in just a moment, if I may, Pete. But before  we move on to the metrics, I wonder if you have any thoughts about the National Food  Strategy in Britain that was published last year. Because it strikes me that the interface<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:17:46">0:17:46-0:18:02</a>:</strong>  that you talk about there between local authorities who are already taking action and national  governments. In the UK, there's been a great big national government discussion for the  last five years about food systems, primarily agricultural systems, how food production<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:02">0:18:02-0:18:17</a>:</strong>  impacts the environment. And I wonder how the National Food Strategy handled that relationship  between local authorities and national governments and if you have a view on it.  My sense is that we completely missed an opportunity or rather England completely missed an opportunity<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:17">0:18:17-0:18:31</a>:</strong>  to engage local authorities in this conversation. We have a very strong network of food policy  councils, sustainable food cities in the UK. And yet it was absent really from the national  food plan. And I think it would be very helpful for local authorities collectively in England<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:31">0:18:31-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  to make a much stronger case when the white paper comes out for co-producing a national  food plan. And it is because local authorities can sell some of these things to their own  populations and get citizen support for them in a different way from national governments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:58</a>:</strong>  A lot of the pressure behind the sugar tax, the soda tax in the UK could only happen because  of a lot of citizen pressure on that, trying to push for that to happen. And similarly,  proposals in the national food plan for a broader sugar tax will only come about, I<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:18:58">0:18:58-0:19:10</a>:</strong>  think, if there's bottom up pressure from local authorities and health boards saying  this would be such a huge benefit to public health. We want really to see it happen.  Yeah, I just wanted to add to that because I think Pete said something really relevant<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:10">0:19:10-0:19:23</a>:</strong>  is that we want to support local authorities and really being able to co-develop any national  food strategies and commitments that will be developed, not just to tackle climate change,  but just anything. Because I think something Pete said really eloquently recently was that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:23">0:19:23-0:19:34</a>:</strong>  we don't just want local authorities to be implementers of these top down strategies  determined at the federal level. We really want them to be included in the process. And  that's certainly part of the reforms that need to take place. But we know that local<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:34">0:19:34-0:19:45</a>:</strong>  authorities are closer to their citizens. They're more responsive. They listen more.  Going back to this issue of marginalized groups, I mean, we have tons of signatories from the  declaration, again, New Haven, Philadelphia, et cetera, who've been having these really<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:45">0:19:45-0:19:59</a>:</strong>  extensive consultations and collaborations with some of these groups in multiple languages,  listening to their concerns, just to make sure that they are part of the decision making.  And that's something that we don't necessarily find as easily or as readily available at<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:19:59">0:19:59-0:20:08</a>:</strong>  the national level. And it's really something that they could learn from when discussing  with local authorities.  The New Haven. So you looking at the potential for working with local authorities, for example,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:08">0:20:08-0:20:22</a>:</strong>  as case studies in particular countries to help develop a national food plan or an international  approach to localized food delivery?  I think it's probably at two levels that we see these things working. Three levels, possibly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:22">0:20:22-0:20:35</a>:</strong>  At the city local authority level, as we mentioned earlier, there's lots of really practical  things that governments can do, local governments can do to influence the food system and to  reduce emissions and to make people healthier. I think then at the national level, we would<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:35">0:20:35-0:20:47</a>:</strong>  certainly encourage a situation where local authorities of all shapes and sizes are involved  in developing those national food plans. And indeed, the plans at the supranational level  at the EU, for example, it's really important that cities and regions play a part in developing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:47">0:20:47-0:20:57</a>:</strong>  that too.  But then I think at the global level, you know, we've been working with the local government  constituency to make sure that the voices of cities and regions are heard at future<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:20:57">0:20:57-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  international events, because they need to be at the table on that because otherwise  there's a real danger that the conversation about food systems, you know, is simply dominated  by national governments, and to some extent by the commercial interests that also, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  know, play into those discussions, but that we continue to have a focus primarily on production  and exports, rather than a whole food systems approach. And I think what local governments  can bring to that is a much more rounded, you know, what will benefit our people approach.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  It strikes me that actually this is not entirely dissimilar to the conversation that we were  having around indigenous populations around the world, that they were feeling that they  were excluded from the COP processes, looking at food systems in the same way that they<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:53</a>:</strong>  need to be brought in. We need local authorities, a whole range of different sort of smaller  stakeholders from around the world to inform that process. It's really interesting. I'm  going to move on thinking further around that variance between assessments of global warming<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:21:53">0:21:53-0:22:07</a>:</strong>  impact on food systems. Isn't it the case that emissions aren't always the best metric  anyway, particularly when we're looking at food production from agroecological farms,  and that we need to move away from this single issue sort of approach to the food system<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:07">0:22:07-0:22:20</a>:</strong>  and food system reform, acknowledge that complexity and assess impacts locally rather than globally?  Yes, absolutely. And I think that was one of the places I was hoping the conversation  would go next. Because, you know, as we said before, it's quite overwhelming to tackle<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:20">0:22:20-0:22:32</a>:</strong>  things holistically from a policy perspective, because, you know, again, it's just not the  way we've ever designed our governance institutions to handle these issues. And I think on top  of that, you then add this COP environment in which we've built commitments around, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:32">0:22:32-0:22:44</a>:</strong>  know, focusing on singular metrics to demonstrate results, you know, be they carbon emissions  or otherwise. But I think what's really important to take note of is that the solutions to actually  take this more integrated assessment approach are out there, including at the local level.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:44">0:22:44-0:22:58</a>:</strong>  You know, we're seeing authorities working with whether it's researchers or groups working  on the ground, to develop these very sophisticated metrics and indicators to measure the breadth  of impacts of food systems, you know, not just on climate and emissions, but on natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:22:58">0:22:58-0:23:12</a>:</strong>  resource use on biodiversity, on nutrition on access, and all of these other areas that  we've already mentioned. So again, we actually already have the tools to develop comprehensive  strategies and the methods or the metrics, sorry, to back up their implementation. If<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:12">0:23:12-0:23:21</a>:</strong>  for me, again, it just takes the willingness to tackle these complexities head on, and  to stop working in these silos where we each have our own limited set of metrics working  on our little piece of the problem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:21">0:23:21-0:23:31</a>:</strong>  Jason Vale, PhD Or indeed limited sets of knowledge.  Anna Tsing, PhD Sure. Yes, exactly. And I think, as you said,  agro-ecological systems just really do this beautifully and break away all of these different<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:31">0:23:31-0:23:43</a>:</strong>  silos we just mentioned, including the knowledge one, you know, because again, these are systems  that are based on a holistic paradigm that considers the entirety of the food systems  and their effects not just on the environment, but as we said, on people, on communities,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:43">0:23:43-0:23:57</a>:</strong>  and even honestly, on the very economic systems that are underpinning how we distribute and  consume our food. And I think in these systems, too, communities have developed impact assessment  tools to show both not just the quantitative but also the qualitative benefits that these<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:23:57">0:23:57-0:24:09</a>:</strong>  systems have, because we often forget about those the qualitative benefits. And what's  great to see is that these these assessment tools are really being picked up by international  institutions like the FAO, like IFAD, who are starting to recognize these, I don't like<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:09">0:24:09-0:24:19</a>:</strong>  the word, but these co-benefits of agro-ecological systems. And again, these more comprehensive  tools that we need to assess them. So I really hope that, you know, we're starting to recognize  this and we'll see progress on that front in the coming years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:19">0:24:19-0:24:31</a>:</strong>  Mason It does seem like there is progress around  that recognition of the importance of agro-ecological systems. And I wonder, Chantal, you asked  me to chair the session that I chaired at COP26 for IPES Food and the World Economic<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:31">0:24:31-0:24:45</a>:</strong>  Forum, various other different stakeholders there. And when we were talking before the  event with policy officers within those organizations, I asked the question, you know, is there a  consensus around things like agro-ecology? And the answer was, no, don't think so. A<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:45">0:24:45-0:24:58</a>:</strong>  consensus even between things like land sharing and land sparing. And actually, there did  seem to be amongst the senior people on the panel there, I mean, as Vice President for  Sustainability for the World Bank, for example, you know, talking about agro-ecology in a<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:24:58">0:24:58-0:25:11</a>:</strong>  way that was perhaps unexpected. And I wonder, were you surprised by the level of consensus  that there actually was around agro-ecology? Chantal Both surprised by the consensus and  surprised by the lack of consensus all at the same time. And I think the main question<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:11">0:25:11-0:25:27</a>:</strong>  there is to ask consensus amongst whom, right? Because for me, there's millions of voices  on the ground, farmers, indigenous communities, local authorities, etc., etc., you know, groups,  civil society groups, that do agree that agro-ecology is the way forward. But where I was seeing<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:27">0:25:27-0:25:42</a>:</strong>  consensus amongst perhaps higher level decision makers was that agro-ecology, if you boil  it down to what it really is, can really serve as this umbrella term that, you know, I think  hosts a whole set of practices that we are actually using right now that we don't call<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:42">0:25:42-0:25:55</a>:</strong>  agro-ecology, organic agriculture, permaculture, you know, even some aspects of regenerative  agriculture, all of these things are inherently agro-ecological. The thing that agro-ecology  does is really just to broaden the umbrella of what you know, of what these things mean.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:25:55">0:25:55-0:26:07</a>:</strong>  And of course, not just to look at agricultural production issues, but to look at, as I said,  the social benefits, the economic complexities of the problem, and all of these other different  areas that we often try to sideline because they're more complicated to look at.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:07">0:26:07-0:26:21</a>:</strong>  We've talked a lot about the environment. We've talked a bit about, you know, where  change needs to come from. Pete, COVID-19 is also a key theme in the Glasgow Food and  Climate Declaration, which says that Coronavirus has exposed the fragility of our food systems<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:21">0:26:21-0:26:38</a>:</strong>  and the vulnerabilities of large parts of our urban and rural populations. How do we  go about delivering preparedness and resilience to future pandemics for our communities?  Well, I think a starting point is nutrition equity. You know, it's in the Global Nutrition<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:38">0:26:38-0:26:52</a>:</strong>  Report, this idea that we need to reduce inequity in the levels of nutrition in our population  is as important, it seems to me, in Scotland as it is in many parts of the world. We have  a two-tier food system. And that goes back, you know, centuries, certainly decades, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:26:52">0:26:52-0:27:06</a>:</strong>  know, where people who have more ability to spend money on food are actually able to nourish  themselves much better. And that's fundamentally unfair, you know, because it impacts on people's  quality of life, but also on their life expectancy, where we've just taken for granted that we<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:06">0:27:06-0:27:21</a>:</strong>  have a universal NHS provision, universal education provision in the UK and most, you  know, most countries in Europe that we somehow seem to tolerate massive inequities in access  to food as being just something we can't really do anything much about. And I think that one<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:21">0:27:21-0:27:37</a>:</strong>  of the things about getting very prepared for a future pandemic is having a healthier  population. You know, if we invested anything like the amount that we've had to invest in  response to pandemic in reducing, for example, you know, the chronic epidemic of diabetes<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:37">0:27:37-0:27:53</a>:</strong>  and other food, diet-related diseases by creating a healthier population through food, if we  got food to do the heavy lifting in health, as John Boydwell recommended 80 years ago,  then actually that would be the one most important thing we could do to be prepared. I do think<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:27:53">0:27:53-0:28:06</a>:</strong>  there's another thing which we learned from COVID-19, which was that local food systems  sprang into action, not just in Scotland, but all over the world. You know, a friend  of ours who mills wheat, you know, was working 24-hour shifts to mill enough wheat so people<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:06">0:28:06-0:28:18</a>:</strong>  could go and make their own bread. And then of course, once COVID ends or the lockdown  ends, you know, he's back to normal shifts and he's got a bit of money in the bank, but  he's still back to where he was. But if we seriously want to have something like an 80-20<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:18">0:28:18-0:28:32</a>:</strong>  system where at least 20% of the food can be sourced locally so that, you know, we're  not dependent on one supply chain for that, it does give us a little bit of resilience  in the system. It doesn't mean we have to sort of shut all the doors and go to 100%.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:32">0:28:32-0:28:42</a>:</strong>  We don't want any import system, which would be crazy, but we can go to a system which  is better balanced, I think, between a resilient local food economy and the global supply chains,  which we've all come to depend on.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:42">0:28:42-0:28:58</a>:</strong>  I wonder the extent to which communities, particularly poorer communities, were more  resilient in the past. And I'm thinking back to my time living outside Glasgow, talking  to people inside Glasgow about the way that poorer areas, perhaps the slums in Glasgow,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:28:58">0:28:58-0:29:15</a>:</strong>  as they would have been in the 50s and the 60s, the way in which those communities had  much greater access to immediate fruit and veg because they were on barrows, they were  on stalls that were in the streets there. And that actually the nutritional availability<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:15">0:29:15-0:29:27</a>:</strong>  was better in those days in some ways than it is now where people, you know, are going  into supermarkets, going for the buy one, get one freeze, which are often on more processed  products. Do you have a sense of the history around that, Pete?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:27">0:29:27-0:29:39</a>:</strong>  Well, certainly, I mean, you go back to 19th century, fruit and veg were highly unavailable  in Glasgow and Dundee, and that contributed to some of the sort of dietary patterns, the  health patterns that we've seen because people were so weaved out of their rural existences<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:39">0:29:39-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  and plonked in the cities at huge densities. And actually there was real access problems  to fruit and veg. I think you're right, probably in the post-war period, some of that improved  and that people could get access to those things. But there's always that question of<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:30:06</a>:</strong>  income and what income people can spend on fruit and veg. But these are the stuff of,  if you like, local food policies. Glasgow's actively looking at how do we increase the  availability of fruit and veg to people in low income communities, but also how do we<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:06">0:30:06-0:30:21</a>:</strong>  increase the production of that within the city walls? Glasgow's blessed with a huge  amount of green space and is now actively looking at converting not just the odd street  corner but significant chunks of the real estate into food growing enterprises that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:21">0:30:21-0:30:35</a>:</strong>  have a commercial activity. Dundee recently recognised they could produce at least a third  of all the fruit and veg requirements for the city on land within the city walls. And  that's something which has gone out of fashion in the UK, but is seen as completely part<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:35">0:30:35-0:30:49</a>:</strong>  of how we do business in other cities that are signed the Glasgow Declaration.  Again, it's exciting to hear what you're talking about there with local authorities and city-wide  strategies and the way that they're focusing on nutrition for poorer populations, for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:30:49">0:30:49-0:31:05</a>:</strong>  population at large. But I'm still sort of going back to the coronavirus response and  what we've learned from coronavirus. And it seems to me that many national governments,  certainly our own in London, seem to have seen the response to the COVID crisis as evidence<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:05">0:31:05-0:31:18</a>:</strong>  that the current model of transnational commodity trading, with big retailers using their logistical  and financial strength to get affordable food to people in times of need, is a sign that  actually the global food system is working.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:18">0:31:18-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  I think we were incredibly lucky. You know, we were very lucky that countries kept their  borders open. They didn't in 2008. And that's why we had the food price spike and a massive  increase in global hunger following the food price spike. You know, to that extent, international<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:43</a>:</strong>  deployment and international relations held and people kept the borders open. And the  supply chain is free. The supply chain is frayed significantly. They didn't break this  time. That doesn't mean that they're never going to break. And it doesn't mean that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:43">0:31:43-0:31:56</a>:</strong>  you know, you're not going to get, if you've got similar situation plus, you know, greater  international tensions, you could have, you know, a crisis. And as everybody said, in  the UK, that's within nine meals. You know, that's, we've had these very just in time<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:31:56">0:31:56-0:32:12</a>:</strong>  supply chains. And so it doesn't take a huge amount. And to go from, you know, to go from  being okay to panic is just a few hours. And I think that's the really scary thing we have  to understand. I don't expect we're likely to move in the short term to massive intervention<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:12">0:32:12-0:32:26</a>:</strong>  stocks, you know, go back to those days. But I do think this question that for every country  has to ask itself is, how can it meet the nutritional needs of its own population within  its own land and sea resources? And what we do know is that the UK as a whole doesn't<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:26">0:32:26-0:32:40</a>:</strong>  do a very good job of that, you know, and if part of that means farming differently,  shifting diets, reducing waste, using our seas better, whatever it is, but I think it,  you know, for every country, you know, we have to think, what is our impact on climate<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:40">0:32:40-0:32:53</a>:</strong>  and nature through our food system, the food we consume, and how could we do more to reduce  that? And part of that is producing more of what we eat and eating more of what we produce.  And I think there's a good argument to say, if we get into a world which is less cooperative,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:32:53">0:32:53-0:33:08</a>:</strong>  then being able to rely on food imports from from other places in the world is something  we should be, you know, more prepared in the eventuality that we can't. But I think on  top of that, you're right, that we'll continue to see an escalation in climate related natural<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:08">0:33:08-0:33:23</a>:</strong>  events that impact on food production. The biggest thing in many ways is, you know, that  the way that we're eating into nature, the way that the food system is eating its own  means of production could precipitate, you know, quite dramatic shifts in in a system<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:23">0:33:23-0:33:34</a>:</strong>  that we don't actually understand very well, you know, the collapse of insect populations  is something which keeps me awake at night, because it could be it could ripple out from  individual areas much more widely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:34">0:33:34-0:33:47</a>:</strong>  We're absolutely going to see that I think we've all said it at this point, but you know,  these extreme weather events mixed with political instability in some areas, mixed with I think  just climate change, generally speaking, is going to lead to a whole host of new vulnerabilities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:47">0:33:47-0:33:58</a>:</strong>  We have documented that there will be more migration, more displacement. So everything  is I think, going to the term that I have in my head right now is not appropriate. But  when things will get difficult, it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:33:58">0:33:58-0:34:03</a>:</strong>  You're gonna say when the shit hits the fan.  I was I was exactly.  You can say that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:03">0:34:03-0:34:16</a>:</strong>  But I think, you know, we've already seen just with a singular pandemic, we saw the  shelves empty out in a lot of, you know, places around the world, we saw what happens, people  start panicking when one singular ship gets stuck in a canal. So you know, we know that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:16">0:34:16-0:34:28</a>:</strong>  these things are on the horizon. And when those things multiply, things will certainly  get worse. And if I can just go back to the COVID measures for one moment, I heard a really  important story in terms of the practical applications of how things get difficult during<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:28">0:34:28-0:34:39</a>:</strong>  the pandemic. I think a lot of us are a bit removed from that. But I was speaking to a  partner in West Africa who was saying that during the pandemic, trucks weren't allowed  to drive at night. So that meant that for food to be distributed, they had to drive<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:39">0:34:39-0:34:50</a>:</strong>  during the day. So there was a backlog of trucks on the highways overnight food was  rotting from the field because it couldn't be distributed because it's usually transported  at night. Farmers couldn't supply their markets. There's all these things that we just don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:34:50">0:34:50-0:35:02</a>:</strong>  see when we purchase food at a supermarket that we don't know that they're happening.  And that, you know, when you put measures in place to deal with a pandemic or other  issues, again, the multiplier effect is huge in terms of how that impacts the food system,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:02">0:35:02-0:35:18</a>:</strong>  farmers, food suppliers, and again, the whole chain. It's massive.  The Declaration talks also about inequalities and talks about the way in which the food  system as it stands today is an accelerant of greater inequality for people already living<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:18">0:35:18-0:35:33</a>:</strong>  in poverty or experiencing racism or who are displaced already due to conflict and climate  change. And in what way are these vulnerable communities impacted by the current food system?  Sure. And that's a great question that no one likes the answer to. And it's because<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:33">0:35:33-0:35:45</a>:</strong>  the dominant food systems that we have right now are essentially based on a history of  exploitation. Exploitation of people, particularly food and farm workers, of women, of indigenous  communities, of communities of colour. And it's not just people, you know, exploitation<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:45">0:35:45-0:35:58</a>:</strong>  of natural resources, of rural spaces, again, all with the aim to produce the largest quantity  of food at the cheapest price that has its benefits. But, you know, to what to what end?  And I think this has affected people's access to land and natural resources, to their right<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:35:58">0:35:58-0:36:10</a>:</strong>  to diversified diets, just to the security of their livelihoods. And, you know, often  just their access to very basic human rights, you know, just to live a healthy and dignified  life. And so, again, as we've been saying, climate change is going to act as a multiplier<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:10">0:36:10-0:36:24</a>:</strong>  of these injustices because it just makes our systems and our society so much more vulnerable  and unpredictable. And as I said before, on top of that, we add political instability  or conflict in certain areas that will inevitably worsen existing poverty, food insecurity and<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:24">0:36:24-0:36:36</a>:</strong>  again access to kind of basic things. And I think we've seen studies that show that  the number of people who are undernourished has actually increased over the past decade.  COVID has worsened that, of course, but that the numbers are really concentrated in regions<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:36">0:36:36-0:36:50</a>:</strong>  that have been facing both extreme weather events and conflicts where, you know, landscapes  are changing, they're unstable, there's displacement, biodiversity has plummeted. So really, again,  just this multiplier effect when you mix multiple conflicts and issues at the same time. And<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:37:03</a>:</strong>  I think just to add one thing is that these aren't just problems that are happening in  areas of political conflict and instability. There was this great piece of research I saw  in the US recently that was looking at the impacts of climate change on communities that<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:03">0:37:03-0:37:15</a>:</strong>  face higher instances of comorbidities. So things like obesity, diabetes, other health  conditions. And firstly, they showed that communities of color were facing much higher  risks of comorbidities due to just structural inequalities, like lack of access to health<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:15">0:37:15-0:37:28</a>:</strong>  care and other crucial resources just like unhealthy food environments, lack of green  spaces in urban areas, etc. And that climate change, especially through things like heatwaves  or other extreme weather events, was exacerbating these health conditions because again, when<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:28">0:37:28-0:37:41</a>:</strong>  communities are lacking health services, basic infrastructure, that they've been pushed historically  into areas with just higher air pollution during heatwaves that worsen. These are just  a few examples of how all of these things just coalesce in these moments of crisis and<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:41">0:37:41-0:37:53</a>:</strong>  just make things worse for the people who are already the worst off.  And when we tend to think of crisis, we tend to think of something that's emerged that  we weren't expecting. But what you're setting out there is an overview, a sort of a bird's<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:37:53">0:37:53-0:38:10</a>:</strong>  eye view of a whole range of different issues which are already present, which we can already  see. And even if they, you know, many of them might be concentrated in poorer nations or  in the global south, they are already starting to impact in the richer nations in the north<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:10">0:38:10-0:38:25</a>:</strong>  of the globe. And these issues around security, around public security, of course, are things  that we were starting to bring out in the solar report that you contributed to as well  for the Food and Global Security Network. But the point is that we can see these things<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:25">0:38:25-0:38:36</a>:</strong>  happening. There are these little fires burning. And if we don't recognise and treat these  little fires and look at solutions like agroecology, we're just going to see a cascading of them.  And we're going to see a rise in the future.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:36">0:38:36-0:38:46</a>:</strong>  Chantelle, these issues are things that the UN Sustainable Development Goals are trying  to address. How do you think a food systems lens in and of itself can help deliver progress  on the SDGs?<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:46">0:38:46-0:38:55</a>:</strong>  Chantelle Léonard-Rice, Global Development Goals Director, Food and Global Security Network  I hope this has become old news at this point because I've been hearing it for I think about  a decade now. But we know that food systems are crucial to meeting the SDGs because food,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:38:55">0:38:55-0:39:07</a>:</strong>  unlike anything else, I think just touches on every single one of them. And just to give  a few examples, you know, looking at the SDG on poverty, and we've talked about poverty  a bit already. You know, creating genuinely sustainable food system fights poverty because<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:07">0:39:07-0:39:21</a>:</strong>  you're creating good jobs, you're improving access to food, you're supporting healthy  communities to be healthy, more self-sufficient, more resilient. If we're looking at SDG3 on  good health and well-being, obviously healthy diversified food systems really help to meet<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:21">0:39:21-0:39:34</a>:</strong>  that goal. Going back to agroecological systems, I think one great example I've heard recently  as well, is just to see that through diversified systems, communities who would traditionally  experience these lean months, so months where communities go for months without food when<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:34">0:39:34-0:39:46</a>:</strong>  you're in between harvests, by diversifying production of nutritious foods, you then have  food all year round because you've diversified, you can stagger your yields, your crops and  your harvests. And it just makes communities more again, self-sufficient, self-reliant,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:46">0:39:46-0:39:59</a>:</strong>  and then just healthy. And then expanding because people always look at the food SDGs.  But if you take SDG5 on gender equality, if you're again, sustainable food systems can  create the infrastructure for women to have access to land to credit to the resources<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:39:59">0:39:59-0:40:13</a>:</strong>  they need to support their livelihoods. And then even going more out there, SDG, I think  16 on peace and strong institutions. Again, we know that sustainable food systems need  to be supported by sound governance mechanisms through participation, through inclusivity.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:13">0:40:13-0:40:26</a>:</strong>  Again, at the local level, we're seeing this happen a bit better because we have these  collaborative schemes between residents and municipal authorities, whether it's food policy  councils or similar bodies. And again, sustainable food systems can be underpinned and can build<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:26">0:40:26-0:40:40</a>:</strong>  just strong governance structures. So again, you know, I could keep going on, the list  goes on and on, but every SDG is related. But of course, we can only meet these in so  far as governments are willing to do this difficult structural work to tie things together,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:40">0:40:40-0:40:50</a>:</strong>  to look at food systems in an integrated way. But again, I think we've said that so many  times now that hopefully that message is clear.  Pete, look, these are great big issues that many people would expect national governments<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:40:50">0:40:50-0:41:04</a>:</strong>  and international processes to take action on. But the Glasgow declarations targeted  sub-national governments and local authorities, as we've been discussing. Do you think that  smaller authorities are inherently better able to address these issues? And I wonder<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:04">0:41:04-0:41:15</a>:</strong>  what the balance is between the actions that should be taken at national and international  level and the actions should be taken at local level?  Well, yes, they do. I think they're better at joining up the system. And that's because<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:15">0:41:15-0:41:27</a>:</strong>  I think they're better at understanding what the purpose of the food system is. The implicit  purpose of the food system, particularly since the war, the global food system, has been  produce and sell. And we've had this feed the world narrative that justifies all sorts<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:27">0:41:27-0:41:41</a>:</strong>  of things in the name of we need to increase production, we need to sell more food. And  you've got a food system which fundamentally underdelivers on what most people think its  goal should be, like nourishing everybody. You know, when we've got 10% of the world's<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:41">0:41:41-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  population not having enough calories to get by and experiencing severe hunger, and 20%  of the world's population eating too much of the wrong stuff and dying young, you know,  and then all the externalities trashing nature and warming the climate, you know, it's a<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:10</a>:</strong>  system which at global level fails to do what ordinary people would think it was there for.  And I think that idea about, you know, if you're in Bristol, what should our food system  do? Well, it should make sure that everybody can eat well, without impacting negatively<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:10">0:42:10-0:42:22</a>:</strong>  on nature and climate while restoring nature and cooling the climate. That's a common sense  understanding what food systems are about. And that can be understood at a local level  quite clearly and held on to. And I think then that different narrative, I think has<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:22">0:42:22-0:42:35</a>:</strong>  to, as we said, go up international governments to make a much clearer argument of what food  system is about and what it's trying to do. The change that we're looking for, the transformation  we're looking for with Next Generation is significant, it's wide ranging, but it will<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:35">0:42:35-0:42:50</a>:</strong>  be experienced locally, it will be experienced by producers on the ground, by food businesses,  and by citizens changing their food practices, experiencing food differently. But hopefully,  just as with the other changes we want to see as a result of tackling climate change,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:42:50">0:42:50-0:43:03</a>:</strong>  people come out of that with a much better relationship with food, a much more equal  relationship with food, with better jobs in food that are properly paid and secure, you  know, with a food system that works for everyone, you know, there's a much brighter possibility<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:03">0:43:03-0:43:17</a>:</strong>  in the food system. And I think quite often, you can get stronger glimpses of that at local  level, you know, the little city of Mont-Sartout in France, you know, just goes, we're going  to 100% organic in our school food, let's just do it. You know, you can get glimpses<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:17">0:43:17-0:43:31</a>:</strong>  of change at the local level, which is sometimes harder to see at the national level.  — So how do we drive this? How do we make this happen? And we're coming to the end of  the programme, so I guess bringing us back to, you know, where we started with the Glasgow<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:31">0:43:31-0:43:47</a>:</strong>  Food and Climate Declaration, it had an objective, you've been getting signatories to that over  the course of the last year. What's next? Is there a way that this declaration and a  response to it can help to get national governments to cede some of the power that no national<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:43:47">0:43:47-0:44:01</a>:</strong>  government likes to cede to local authorities to start building up this plan of action?  — Absolutely. I think really the conversation on food at the climate COP has really only  just begun. And I think if we're going to truly build sustainable food systems, again,<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:01">0:44:01-0:44:14</a>:</strong>  ones that are based on justice, equity, resilience, diversity, we need to be having a completely  different and expanded conversation on how food systems are part of the solution. And,  you know, we haven't quite had a chance to talk about power. But from what I saw, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:14">0:44:14-0:44:27</a>:</strong>  know, I really think the climate COP may be becoming the next sort of global battleground  to determine the future of our food systems. And I really think the Glasgow Food and Climate  Declaration will continue to play a role, not just in amplifying the voices of local<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:27">0:44:27-0:44:38</a>:</strong>  communities and global debates, but also, again, as the strong reminder to decision  makers that they need to be accountable to their citizens, they need to be accountable  to local level actors, and those actually making our food systems function on a day<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:38">0:44:38-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  to day. I think local authorities have recognized that. So for me, it's really time that we  keep amplifying those voices and global debates. You know, as we look forward to COP 27 already,  the Glasgow Declaration, we're really hoping to grow out our list of signatories, because<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  we talked about a whole group of actors during this conversation that need to be included.  So more communities, more cities, more states and regions, tribal nations, indigenous communities.  I think we've already been doing this since the start of COP 26. But we also want to share<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:17</a>:</strong>  just more stories of success. We talked about, you know, little fires burning everywhere.  But I think there's also, as Pete just said, glimmers of hope also happening everywhere.  And so through I think these case where we've been publishing short case studies on the<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:17">0:45:17-0:45:29</a>:</strong>  Glasgow Declaration website, just to really give people concrete examples of the changes  that are happening, and not just the practical changes, but also, again, these very important  governance mechanisms that have to be put in place to make these things happen. So I<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:29">0:45:29-0:45:42</a>:</strong>  think moving forward, you know, there's of course, the implementation piece because cities  will continue to do the good work on the ground through various means. But we absolutely have  to continue carrying this political message to COP 27, that food and local level action<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:42">0:45:42-0:45:53</a>:</strong>  are crucial to curb the climate crisis, especially, you know, when those actions can be inclusive  and participatory and comprehensive.  Fantastic. Pete, I'm looking for a prediction just to take us to the end of the programme.<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:45:53">0:45:53-0:46:03</a>:</strong>  Which COPs are it going to be when food systems finally make it to the top table? Is it going  to be COP 27?  I think that's undeniable it's going to be COP 27. We've already heard from the Egyptian<br />
<strong><a href="https://anchor.fm/farmgate/episodes/Glasgow-Food--Climate-Declaration-e1blcsi#t=0:46:03">0:46:03-0:46:19</a>:</strong>  Environment Minister that she sees COP 27 having food at its heart. But as Chantal says,  that's a great first start. But the question is, how do we frame that debate so that it's  not about technical fixes? You know, one of the criticisms we had at the UN Food Systems<br />
