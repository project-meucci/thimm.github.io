We're at the top of the food chain.  But yet everything that we create and build will eventually be taken apart one day by<br />

And we wouldn't be here without them.  Today we're going to take a deep dive into the mystery in the world that is fungi.<br />

Whereas most organisms, most animals and things only have one nucleus, one set of genetics,  these ones have upwards of tens of thousands.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:01:13">0:01:13-0:01:28</a>:</strong>  In my mind, they're much like the genetic reserves, the world's genetic database and  library in the soil.  Peter's a teacher at Michael Logos and he's author of the book Radical Mycology.<br />

This is one of those episodes that's intense in a good way.  There's a lot of stuff that we're going to talk about in this episode that you've never<br />

And I think it's safe to say that this is probably one of those episodes that you're  going to have to listen to a few times to get everything out of.<br />

This is In Search of Soil.  Today I'm talking to Peter McCoy, author of the book Radical Mycology, teacher at Michael<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:21">0:02:21-0:02:33</a>:</strong>  There's a lot of craziness happening out there in the world.  There's a lot of climate change talkers out there.  And one of the things I thought maybe to start this out with was, are there more mycelium<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:33">0:02:33-0:02:47</a>:</strong>  on the planet now than when we talked last, which is probably three or four years ago?  Like, is mycelium getting more robust as time goes on or are we seeing less of it due to  the activities of man?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:02:47">0:02:47-0:03:02</a>:</strong>  I mean, that's a great question to be pretty hard to measure.  You know, I always like to believe in the resiliency of fungi.  I mean, if there's central tenets to mycology is that fungi bounce back and they are great<br />

And so, you know, even despite the harshest conditions that the natural world brings about,<br />

So even what humans are doing, even though some of it might be fairly novel in the history<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:25">0:03:25-0:03:40</a>:</strong>  of the Earth, I would like to think that if not the fungi that were in the place before  was disturbed or the ones that come back, you know, another group of fungi come in to  fill the niche that the many niches that fungi fulfill, because without them, you know, life<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:40">0:03:40-0:03:51</a>:</strong>  can't really kickstart.  You have those extreme spaces, the really bad superfund sites and brownfields and things  where it seems like nothing's really alive, although there is always some sort of weed<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:03:51">0:03:51-0:04:02</a>:</strong>  plant growing and, you know, there might very well be fungi there.  And perhaps that's where we can come in to actually, of course, facilitate the acceleration  of what would naturally occur if given time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:02">0:04:02-0:04:13</a>:</strong>  And so all that's to say that while I can't necessarily quantify it, I don't think fungi  are going away anytime soon.  You know, even the worst things that humans might ever do to the planet or the temperatures<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:13">0:04:13-0:04:24</a>:</strong>  go off the charts more so than we've ever measured or recorded human history, I think  fungi will still find a way.  And that's what we find in all the fossil records and all the great extinction level<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:24">0:04:24-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  events.  Fungi, there's a thicker layer in the fossil bed implying that they sort of dominated the  planet, turned the nutrients around and enabled the next big generation to move forward.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:51</a>:</strong>  And that's one of the things that's always given me, I think, a really solid and true  sense of hope in maybe some longer term geological timescale when things might look a little  bit more bleak on the immediate human timescale, just kind of knowing that no matter what fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:04:51">0:04:51-0:05:05</a>:</strong>  will persist, you know, life goes on and the nutrient cycle and, you know, again, things  have a way of bouncing back and adapting in another major tenet of fungi is not just resilience,  but evolution slash adaptation to new challenges.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:05">0:05:05-0:05:19</a>:</strong>  So we do find effects of the things that humans do to the environment, which we can, of course,  certainly get into, and changes of soil temperature due to climatic changes are affecting not  only plant populations, but fungal populations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:19">0:05:19-0:05:30</a>:</strong>  And this is being slowly tracked in a handful of studies.  So certainly there's concern there for their patterns, the fruiting patterns of mushrooms  is a more measurable effect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:30">0:05:30-0:05:42</a>:</strong>  We can see, you know, the season goes longer, the mushrooms fruit later.  This is going to affect nutrient cycling, insect populations, herbivores who eat, and  small mammals who eat the mushrooms, their populations and everything that comes after<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:42">0:05:42-0:05:49</a>:</strong>  that.  So there's big questions there and certainly things we were going to be wondering about  and maybe to some degree worrying about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:05:49">0:05:49-0:06:03</a>:</strong>  But we always, I mean, for me at least, you got to kind of hope that things iron themselves  out to some degree with fungi often pioneering or helping show the way.  Yeah, I think as humans, you know, we have that kind of God complex that we are the tail<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:03">0:06:03-0:06:17</a>:</strong>  that wags the dog and we're small in the big scheme of things.  And I think it was in your book, your Radical Mycology that I was reading that something  like we produce 7% of the CO2 that's in the atmosphere is human related and something<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:17">0:06:17-0:06:32</a>:</strong>  like 85% of it's coming out of the soil might not have been in your book.  I think it was, but I thought that was a pretty remarkable fact that really a lot of that  CO2 is coming out of the soil and people don't think that normally.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:32">0:06:32-0:06:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah, I mean, you know, I'm not one to be discussing or really arguing about greenhouse  gases.  You know, they say that CO2 is actually not as bad as some of the other ones, methane<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:44">0:06:44-0:06:58</a>:</strong>  and things.  But as far as the CO2 goes, the lion's share, yeah, by far, I thought it was more than 85%.  I have it more in like by the tons, by billions of tons is the metric I give.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:06:58">0:06:58-0:07:13</a>:</strong>  But still it's the vast, vast majority is coming out of the soil, but just sort of generally  through deep fungal decomposition, fungal respiration is the thought fungi respire and  release CO2 as a part of their cellular metabolism, just like we do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:13">0:07:13-0:07:25</a>:</strong>  But their their tissue and their volume is in such higher amounts throughout the world  that they are they're producing so much more than even all of our industries and everything  combined.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:25">0:07:25-0:07:33</a>:</strong>  So it's it's an interesting, you know, again, I can't draw any conclusions.  I don't know.  I'm not a climate scientist, but it's interesting to think, well, how much have we added in<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:33">0:07:33-0:07:41</a>:</strong>  just the last couple hundred years of industrial civilization?  What have you to just tip that scale?  I mean, I don't know the numbers, but it is it kind of just puts things in a different<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:41">0:07:41-0:07:49</a>:</strong>  perspective.  You know, and you realize, you know, CO2 is super critical for all of life and it's almost  a different way to not fear it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:49">0:07:49-0:07:56</a>:</strong>  I mean, obviously, we should be concerned about what we're doing in all the ways and  where does that CO2 come from and the other effects of the industries and the automobiles  that produce the CO2.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:07:56">0:07:56-0:08:06</a>:</strong>  They're also producing all kinds of other stuff.  But just as far as CO2 is like we sort of simplified it like that's the problem.  It's kind of an easy, easy way to bottle it all up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:06">0:08:06-0:08:18</a>:</strong>  But it's a critical, you know, gas, a critical molecule in life and plant life.  And it's produced by one of our best allies, the fungi.  So if you think about that, I mean, fungi producing CO2 plants consuming CO2.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:18">0:08:18-0:08:29</a>:</strong>  You have the cycle there.  It's really us living in their world.  Yeah, I mean, one of the ways I truly think about fungi and sort of ecology broadly and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:29">0:08:29-0:08:44</a>:</strong>  humans placed in the world is that we, the human system, the humans and mammals and higher  animal, pretty much all animals are really a subsystem of the fungal system that has  been here for much longer, for billions of years longer, and is really in so many ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:44">0:08:44-0:08:54</a>:</strong>  sculpting the world around us.  I think a lot of people, for good reason, historically have focused, of course, on the  flora and fauna, the more visible organisms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:08:54">0:08:54-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  And then in more recent decades, the bacteria and those organisms in the soil and their  role.  Fungi have always just throughout their short history as a science, mycology rather, has<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:13</a>:</strong>  been just sort of swept aside, overlooked because we don't really know much and we  didn't know to look there.  But the whole paradigm shift that comes with studying fungi is that as you learn more,<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:13">0:09:13-0:09:26</a>:</strong>  they kind of just seem to take center stage in any conversation.  You can sound biased, but the science just kind of keeps leading back to that conclusion.  And in everything they do, especially throughout the soil, the nutrient cycling, yes, bacteria<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:26">0:09:26-0:09:36</a>:</strong>  play a part in the insects and everything plays a part, of course, but the things that  fungi do and sort of the way they do it, we can argue that in especially certain ecosystems,  they're critical.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:36">0:09:36-0:09:45</a>:</strong>  I mean, they're just they're at the center of these webs.  And without them, if you removed the fungi, everything falls apart.  They are the keystone, the grand connectors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:45">0:09:45-0:09:57</a>:</strong>  And because of that, everything ripples out, essentially, sort of especially from the soil  where they're doing a lot of the most important work.  Then we're, as humans, as dependent on the natural world, especially more so historically<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:09:57">0:09:57-0:10:08</a>:</strong>  and still today, of course, through all the things we engineer, we wouldn't have all  the resources we take advantage of without fungi kickstarting so much of these processes.  And it's just it's a different twist.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:08">0:10:08-0:10:20</a>:</strong>  It's a way to there's a lot of reasons I like to play that, put that picture in the world.  When I walk out almost anywhere, even on the sidewalk, I can see fungi in the cracks and  sort of think about what they're doing there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:20">0:10:20-0:10:31</a>:</strong>  But it still just sort of helps you take a step back, reassess your assumptions, look,  try to look at things differently.  And and then just especially from the sort of myco centric or myco informed and inspired<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:31">0:10:31-0:10:42</a>:</strong>  perspective, just kind of always wondering, OK, well, what could they be doing?  And all these things we don't know as you learn more.  It's one of those things you realize what you don't know and what we all don't know<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:42">0:10:42-0:10:53</a>:</strong>  scientists, the scientific community doesn't know, not just mycologists, but sort of all  scientists based on their lack of knowledge about mycology as a rule of thumb throughout  all of academia.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:10:53">0:10:53-0:11:03</a>:</strong>  And it kind of again, kind of brings up this hope for me.  And I think a lot of people where you realize, OK, even though we're told all the time,  you know, scientists sort of figured everything out and, you know, this is how it's looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:03">0:11:03-0:11:13</a>:</strong>  for the future.  You can come back and say, well, we still actually don't know all this stuff about fungi.  And as we discover more, there are actually tons of possible positive, very optimistic<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:13">0:11:13-0:11:26</a>:</strong>  solutions that they can offer some good tools for our toolboxes.  And let's not throw in the towel just yet, because it seems like there's a lot we haven't  applied in a human system type setting or even just gone to sort of assess or understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:26">0:11:26-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  or try to try to measure out the natural world.  And again, the more we uncover that papers keep coming out all the time.  It's such a young science.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:35">0:11:35-0:11:45</a>:</strong>  It just keeps reinforcing this perspective, these new sort of paradigms for me and other  people that again, fungi are sort of the rulers of the world, the secret society of the world  in some respect.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:45">0:11:45-0:11:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  I mean, thinking about your book as an analogy here, it's 600 and something pages long.  If this represented all the knowledge that we have of fungi now, how many pages into<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:11:56">0:11:56-0:12:02</a>:</strong>  the book are we right now?  Well, that's the thing is we don't know what we don't know.  I mean, it really comes out.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:02">0:12:02-0:12:14</a>:</strong>  We're at the beginning really of mycology.  I like to think one of my big interests, I see two major pillars in the world of mycology.  We have the fungal ecology and the big questions there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:14">0:12:14-0:12:28</a>:</strong>  And then the human intersections, the ethnomycology.  And that both implies historical relationships throughout history and cultures around the  world, which is interesting to me, but also today applying our understandings from fungal<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:28">0:12:28-0:12:40</a>:</strong>  ecology to human systems and to different industries and taking there's a lot of applications  that kind of just to put it short.  And it's again, one of these things we're not only discovering so much about the fungal<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:40">0:12:40-0:12:52</a>:</strong>  ecology, we're also looking further into the past or revisiting the past, revisiting our  assumptions about human culture, seeing fungi being incorporated in ways anthropologists  never thought to think about or to question.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:12:52">0:12:52-0:13:09</a>:</strong>  And then again today, more and more young people, entrepreneurs and creatives and scientists  seeing new applications of fungi in the things that we do as humans in a totally new perspectives  as unprecedented applications.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:09">0:13:09-0:13:23</a>:</strong>  We live in what I like to call the fourth major era or chapter or volume or what have  you in the human fungal story.  The first chapter being sort of all of antiquity, all of traditional cultures working with fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:23">0:13:23-0:13:33</a>:</strong>  a bunch of different ways and means.  And that's the biggest chapter.  Then we had the start of modern mycology as a science roughly 200, 250 years ago.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:33">0:13:33-0:13:46</a>:</strong>  And that was mostly focused on trying to largely name mushrooms and lichens to some degree  because they were more visible and then later molds and yeast when we had microscopes.  And then in the mid 20th century, culturally we shifted with the psychoactive fungi and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:46">0:13:46-0:13:59</a>:</strong>  better cultivation skills that paralleled and came alongside that and went eventually  into gourmet mushrooms and medicinals and things as well.  And now we have sort of more readily available edible mushrooms.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:13:59">0:13:59-0:14:13</a>:</strong>  And now in just recent years, it's sort of this transition period over the last 10, 15,  however you want to measure it, where we've gone from a lot of unknowns ecologically,  especially in the cultivation world, it was all trial and error for the last hundred years,<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:13">0:14:13-0:14:24</a>:</strong>  trying to figure out how to just grow mushrooms because relative to the 10,000 years of plant  domestication, mushroom growing is really on a technical side and more efficient side,  only about 100, 200 years old.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:24">0:14:24-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  So we hardly knew anything.  And now we finally come to this point after all of human history where we know so much  more about their roles throughout the world than ever before.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:44</a>:</strong>  And we have the technology in many different realms to apply that knowledge and be creative  with it.  And this leads to all this untapped potential that so many people are recognizing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:44">0:14:44-0:14:53</a>:</strong>  And so that's one of the things, I mean, there's many things I love about mycology,  but that's a big part of it too.  It's just we don't know what we're going to find or who's going to come up with what<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:14:53">0:14:53-0:15:06</a>:</strong>  tomorrow and it keeps you a little bit on the edge of your seat.  Mycology is one of the youngest natural sciences, just from the natural sciences perspective,  naming the mushrooms, naming the micro fungi, the moles and the yeast and the soil fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:06">0:15:06-0:15:16</a>:</strong>  and figuring out their ecology, that's super young.  And all the applications, I mean, it's just it's an exploding field.  And there's been many papers, a good number, all very well written, very articulate and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:16">0:15:16-0:15:30</a>:</strong>  with all kinds of strong arguments for the last 10 years saying, you know, mycology is  essentially the phrase that's been used as a neglected mega science.  It's a massive field with so much potential for all these reasons I've discussed and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:30">0:15:30-0:15:42</a>:</strong>  completely overlooked, completely off of everybody's radar, completely missing from all levels  of education.  And you know, there has been concern in the not too distant past among academic mycologists<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:42">0:15:42-0:15:52</a>:</strong>  that the science might actually fade from really existence.  There's very few mycology departments and universities and the funding was going away.  I really think that thanks to the Internet and all the reasons that mycology sort of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:15:52">0:15:52-0:16:01</a>:</strong>  popping back up or really coming up for the first time in modern history, that won't be  an issue going forward.  But there was almost a window there where there was concern.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:01">0:16:01-0:16:11</a>:</strong>  I think in a lot of ways it became it's cool again.  And there's that saying, you know, like all the ideas have been thought of.  There aren't any new ideas.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:11">0:16:11-0:16:24</a>:</strong>  And I think the thing that I find most interesting about mycology fungi when it comes to the  soil and around agriculture is maybe there is stuff new.  Like you could make a new discovery.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:24">0:16:24-0:16:35</a>:</strong>  You could tap into something that could really be a game changer.  And a lot of these hacks, tips, tricks, it's just recycled stuff that kind of works or  it's been talked about for a very long time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:35">0:16:35-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  And here we have this wide potential body of knowledge that we don't fully understand.  Like you said, we might not know what we don't know yet.  And that I think is really exciting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:16:47">0:16:47-0:17:06</a>:</strong>  And when you think about just isolating the fungal world and agriculture, where do you  think ag is with relation to its understanding of how important fungi are we in parallel  with the rest of the world and the rest of the applications for mycology?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:06">0:17:06-0:17:12</a>:</strong>  Or are we a little ahead?  Are we lagging?  Yeah, you meaning in North America or?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:12">0:17:12-0:17:23</a>:</strong>  Yeah, let's say North America, like the Western knowledge in agriculture.  Do we give fungi their due or are we still like, that ain't important?  Pour some chemicals on it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:23">0:17:23-0:17:36</a>:</strong>  Well, yeah, no, no.  I mean, again, the rule of thumb and it's kind of not to disparage anybody or any group.  It's just I go into any educational system, any new setting of talking to people, assuming<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:36">0:17:36-0:17:43</a>:</strong>  that most people don't know anything.  And that's just because, you know, not that I know more or something, it's that literally  we don't ever learn.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:43">0:17:43-0:17:50</a>:</strong>  Most people don't learn.  They're on their education systems and on the mainstream media.  So I come into it, you know, sort of trying to help people start from the beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:50">0:17:50-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  What are fungi, the basic definition and trying to just build that language, break down the  taboos and the barriers.  And, you know, they're not all bad and they're really interesting and they're not all psycho<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:14</a>:</strong>  active and they have all these benefits and all these things and, you know, sort of normalize.  And that's what a lot of my work has been for over a decade in many different forms,  just trying to make this thing not only cool, but, you know, relevant and just as familiar<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:14">0:18:14-0:18:23</a>:</strong>  as the notion of bacteria or the notion of backyard gardening of vegetables.  You know, it's not necessarily for everybody, but we know about it.  It's socially acceptable.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:23">0:18:23-0:18:32</a>:</strong>  It's commonplace and it's taught in school in some form.  And we are we're getting there, you know, more teachers are coming on board and want  to teach their kids and stuff.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:32">0:18:32-0:18:44</a>:</strong>  But of course, by and large, people that are, you know, in the world doing things they don't  know much.  And so it's definitely my interest to help shift that, raise awareness and enable skills<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:44">0:18:44-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  so that someday I learn from other people and more people are making innovations.  You know, right now, the world of applied mycology, which is sort of the outside of  academia, just doing stuff with fungi in all these different ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:19:05</a>:</strong>  It's very small in the world and in North America.  There's just a handful of folks, you know, really kind of doing stuff and they're great  and innovative, but we need so many more.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:05">0:19:05-0:19:14</a>:</strong>  You know, there's only so much one person can do.  And so, you know, I try to do sort of my things, but I've always just been so much more interested  in the education and watching the culture grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:14">0:19:14-0:19:19</a>:</strong>  And, you know, I can't wait for that because more people are going to come up with more  ideas than I ever could.  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:19">0:19:19-0:19:29</a>:</strong>  And it's going to be better for everybody.  And so that applies in kind of almost any realm you can think of.  And it depends on what you want to focus on when we talk about mycology and in the realm<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:29">0:19:29-0:19:43</a>:</strong>  of sort of food production, if we want to just sort of whittle it down to that.  You know, mushroom cultivation, edible mushroom, gourmet mushrooms is fairly uncommon.  You know, globally, the market is dominated roughly a third by the Portobello slash Cremini<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:43">0:19:43-0:19:48</a>:</strong>  slash white button mushroom.  It's all the same species.  It's fairly agriculturally intensive to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:19:48">0:19:48-0:20:00</a>:</strong>  Or well, the system's designed because it's such a large industry, it's very industrially  produced, I guess I should say.  So it's a bit more removed, less humble than a lot of other mushroom farms, if that matters<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:00">0:20:00-0:20:07</a>:</strong>  to you.  But still, it's also one of the least nutritious mushrooms, in my opinion, one of the least  delicious mushrooms relative to other species.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:07">0:20:07-0:20:14</a>:</strong>  Not to say that you can't cook it well.  So that, you know, that right there is just a big turn off.  Most people think that mushrooms don't taste good, this is my experience, because they've<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:14">0:20:14-0:20:23</a>:</strong>  either had really like just cold mushrooms from the salad bar, you know, not cooked,  which is horrible, or really poorly cooked.  Most restaurants, in my opinion, don't cook them properly.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:23">0:20:23-0:20:33</a>:</strong>  So just right there, off the culinary standpoint, most people just, oh, they dismiss it, and  then I give them a properly cooked mushroom that tastes better, and it blows their mind,  they love mushrooms after that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:33">0:20:33-0:20:50</a>:</strong>  In the realm of agriculture, I guess more specifically, not only are the mushrooms not  really cultivated heavily, the macro fungi, just the application of, or the ability to  utilize essentially almost every, probably all organic waste streams that every agricultural<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:20:50">0:20:50-0:21:06</a>:</strong>  and animal based system produces, the things that we really can't compost easily, or  can't use as fodder, I believe in time we will find a good way to run that through fungi  of some form, not only maybe make the, say a really good example is cotton bean, coffee<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:06">0:21:06-0:21:15</a>:</strong>  bean holes, which are too tannic for fodder, after fungal fermentation and digestion, it  becomes protein infused and viable fodder.  Plus, you get mushrooms out of that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:15">0:21:15-0:21:30</a>:</strong>  You apply that to any waste stream that we produce, and they've shown through the last  century that hundreds of agricultural residues can be used as mushroom substrate.  If you spread that all across the Midwest and every farmer of every scale and backyard<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:30">0:21:30-0:21:44</a>:</strong>  gardener and enable them through having your neighborhood mushroom growing supply store,  like you have your neighborhood plant growing supply stores, to take their garden waste  or their farm waste and grow another crop out of it, or produce fodder, or produce a<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:21:44">0:21:44-0:22:01</a>:</strong>  mycelium based tabletop or other object, and we close our loop so much more, once that  becomes as commonplace again as backyard gardening, I mean, I can't even necessarily imagine  or measure the cultural implications and the resource management implications of that,<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:01">0:22:01-0:22:16</a>:</strong>  let alone hopefully how it might inspire kids or make them see this process, which cultivation  is really strange and unusual the first few times you see it, and I think kids love it  and whatever that could lead them to to care about nature more and things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:16">0:22:16-0:22:22</a>:</strong>  And that's just one example.  I mean, I could certainly go on, but right there we have a huge loss.  It's really interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:22">0:22:22-0:22:37</a>:</strong>  I mean, just to think that there's something so integral to the cycle of life, something  that there's so much of it around us, and we understand so little that most people,  like I bet if you just asked most people on the street, what is mycelium, they would have<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:37">0:22:37-0:22:47</a>:</strong>  zero concept, and maybe even a lot of people listening to this who are educated on the  subject they follow, and I mean, they're still like, well, I kind of know what it is.  It's that white stuff in the ground.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:22:47">0:22:47-0:23:01</a>:</strong>  And one quote that I saw, and it's in your book, I saw it on your Instagram, blew my  mind was, though not often considered in soil assessments, fungal mycelium and the compounds  they produce may be the primary source of carbon for whole soil communities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:01">0:23:01-0:23:13</a>:</strong>  This has major implications for carbon storage strategies and for understanding system dynamics  across biomes.  That blew my mind when I read that, because that's something I had never thought of.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:13">0:23:13-0:23:31</a>:</strong>  A lot of people in the regenerative ag movement, it's about carbon farming, it's about carbon  sequestration, one, to potentially help with climate change, but two, to also feed soils.  Like carbon-rich soils are healthier and better for the plants that we want to grow than carbon-deficient<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:31">0:23:31-0:23:37</a>:</strong>  soils.  Now, where's all that carbon, or where is a big source of that carbon in the soils?  It's mycelium.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:37">0:23:37-0:23:52</a>:</strong>  And that, again, it blew my mind when I think a lot of people listening to this in the farm  space never would have thought of that before or had heard that before.  Yeah, I mean, there's many types of fungi in the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:23:52">0:23:52-0:24:02</a>:</strong>  Just like the other organisms in the soil, very few of them can be cultured in the laboratory  and studied under isolation.  And even if they can be, what they're doing under the microscope might be relatively quite<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:02">0:24:02-0:24:18</a>:</strong>  different than how they're performing in community.  Still, we know there are many types of fungi, all kinds of decomposers, some simpler molds,  certainly many types of ectomycorrhizal mushrooms and truffles.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:18">0:24:18-0:24:29</a>:</strong>  And that's where, and other mycorrhizal fungi in general, but especially the mushroom and  truffles we can see and are a little bit easier to measure in some respect and genetically  sequence.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:29">0:24:29-0:24:39</a>:</strong>  And that metric or that notion, I mean, that was more or less my rewriting of a similar  quote out of a paper discussing mycorrhizal fungi.  So again, it wasn't necessarily me making that up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:39">0:24:39-0:24:52</a>:</strong>  It's sort of, I believe I hopefully have a citation there for that notion because yeah,  when I read that, I had the same response.  The way they said it, this is, and yet it's completely in all soil assessments and ecological<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:24:52">0:24:52-0:25:05</a>:</strong>  metrics of environmental health and soil health is the mycelial community and the exudates,  the metabolites they produce, what's their quantity because it is so much food for the  web.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:05">0:25:05-0:25:20</a>:</strong>  The notion in short is that the atmospheric carbon is brought into plants through photosynthesis,  goes through their body and does lots of things to all the fungi that live inside of them.  Every plant is a quilt of potentially trillions of fungi that are helping the plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:20">0:25:20-0:25:30</a>:</strong>  And those are known as endophytic fungi.  Once the carbon makes its rounds, it'll go down to the root, feed its roots and the immediate  rhizosphere people are familiar with.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:30">0:25:30-0:25:45</a>:</strong>  But most critically, it goes on to the mycorrhizosphere.  It incorporates and interacts with the mycorrhizal fungi that are locking onto the root system  and that mycorrhizal, that mycelial network goes on and spreads vast distances and covers<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:25:45">0:25:45-0:26:00</a>:</strong>  so much more surface area because its individual threads or what are known as hyphae are so  much smaller in diameter relative to even the finest meristem root hair that as they  go out, their surface area, just their amount of tissue becomes carbon rich.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:00">0:26:00-0:26:08</a>:</strong>  And then as it grows, it's releasing all kinds of compounds, many of which incorporate  lots of carbon.  Those are released in the environment.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:08">0:26:08-0:26:18</a>:</strong>  That's how the fungus digests and lives in its environment.  It releases much of its chemistry that feeds other organisms, is left behind as the fungus  accumulates byproducts of digestion.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:18">0:26:18-0:26:27</a>:</strong>  So some of these compounds are digestive, some of them are protective.  But a lot of waste is left behind.  A lot of byproducts of the digestion is left behind as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:27">0:26:27-0:26:39</a>:</strong>  That includes carbon and it makes it more accessible to other organisms and kick starts  some of the branches in the food web.  But also the tissue itself, as it grows, it branches, older branches in the network that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:39">0:26:39-0:26:49</a>:</strong>  maybe aren't really accessing nutrients well anymore will be sort of snipped off or  culled internally by the fungus and it's left behind to die off and it becomes food  for the soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:26:49">0:26:49-0:27:04</a>:</strong>  And so there's so much tissue, a fungal mycelium in the soil, you've probably heard  the metrics, you know, in every cubic centimeter there's miles of mycelium.  All that tissue eventually is going to die and it's one of the primarily translocators<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:04">0:27:04-0:27:15</a>:</strong>  of atmospheric carbon into the terrestrial earth.  Yes, the trees do that, they're a grand facilitator, but it's truly the mycelium that  goes across hectares to spread it so much further than a single root system can.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:15">0:27:15-0:27:23</a>:</strong>  And that's the connector.  And then along the way, the mycorrhizae are doing many other things that add to their  ecological significance.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:23">0:27:23-0:27:35</a>:</strong>  But yeah, the carbon sinking, them being one of the major carbon sources and sinks of soil  is, I mean, the implications are huge and again, you're not going to read that many  sources.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:35">0:27:35-0:27:46</a>:</strong>  So mycelium itself, what is it made out of?  It gets culled, it's not producing anymore, it's left in the soil.  What is now in the soil when other microorganisms can come digest that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:46">0:27:46-0:27:57</a>:</strong>  What is it made out of?  Well, I mean, the cells of mycelium are pretty similar internally to animal cells and plant  cells.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:27:57">0:27:57-0:28:12</a>:</strong>  So they have eukaryotic cells and basic biology concepts, prokaryotes are bacteria with really  simple cells and the eukaryotes are more evolved.  Plants have, so animal cells are just kind of like water balloons and we have all the<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:12">0:28:12-0:28:27</a>:</strong>  organelles and the nucleus and things inside that, but we have soft tissue, right?  Plants have a cell wall that includes cellulose, hemicellulose and potentially lignin if it's  a more woody plant and that gives the plant structure to grow upright, flopping over,<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:27">0:28:27-0:28:39</a>:</strong>  unless it's a simpler plant.  And then, and that's one of the distinguishing features of plants is their cell wall structure.  Fungi also have a cell wall, so it's an extra layer beyond the water balloon, the cell membrane<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:28:39">0:28:39-0:28:53</a>:</strong>  that contains the internal components, but their cell wall is different from plants.  So its primary compounds are chitin, it's the same compound that makes up insect exoskeletons  and lobster shells.<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:05">0:29:05-0:29:19</a>:</strong>  And then that's about 10% of the cell wall structure.  The other 80 to 90% are high weight table sugars and, or excuse me, high weight sugars  and not table sugar, so much more complex than fruit sugars or table sugar, a very long<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:19">0:29:19-0:29:33</a>:</strong>  chain high molecular weight, very complex sugars.  And sugars are made up of, they're called polysaccharides and they're made up of monosaccharides,  individual units of carbon rich rings, tons and tons and tons of carbon.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:33">0:29:33-0:29:44</a>:</strong>  And this is what primarily forms the vast majority of the fungal cell wall is, you know,  I don't have the exact percentage, but it's a ton of carbon.  A lot of these sugars are actually what we attribute some of the medicinal effects of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:44">0:29:44-0:29:54</a>:</strong>  fungi to.  So it's, that's where a lot of that comes from is these sugars, some of these sugars.  And a lot of that, again, just folds away and is easy to be digested by microbes.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:29:54">0:29:54-0:30:05</a>:</strong>  It's essentially a sugar, the bond between each of the monomers is the same type of bond  you'll find in simple fruit sugars.  You just have many of them strung together in one super long chain, whereas simple sugars<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:05">0:30:05-0:30:15</a>:</strong>  are just a few of these monomers and they're fairly short.  And so that's a lot of what's left behind.  Again, 80 to 90 percent of the whole cell wall, you know, a lot of the fungal structure,<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:15">0:30:15-0:30:29</a>:</strong>  what makes it unusual or different from other organisms is this material.  And I guess, well, I guess just last bit for the people that want all the details on the  exterior of it, this a little bit more, it's pretty interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:29">0:30:29-0:30:40</a>:</strong>  There is also a thin layer of proteins which are fairly hydrophobic.  And so it actually repels water.  And it's actually thought that this helps the mycelium glide through its substrate more<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:40">0:30:40-0:30:52</a>:</strong>  easily because it's sort of sliding through it and pushing stuff away, which has an effect  on the qualities of mycelium as a structural material.  It makes it fire retardant, actually it makes it more buoyant and things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:52">0:30:52-0:30:57</a>:</strong>  But that's more of an aside.  No, no, it's great.  It's totally cool how this all works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:30:57">0:30:57-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  And I mean, the remarkable thing about fungi is all these layers, along with other things  happening within the organism itself, make it hard to penetrate while it's living.  It culls off.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:11">0:31:11-0:31:25</a>:</strong>  Given how kind of the soil cycle works, is a lot of that stuff going to be bioavailable  to the other organisms in the soil when it's no longer there?  Or are you going to need other fungi to come digest the old fungi so then other organisms<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:25">0:31:25-0:31:35</a>:</strong>  can get access to that?  Or when it sloughs off, is it kind of fair game for other things in the soil that might  want to have targeted it when it was alive, but now it's not?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:44</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  I mean, when mycelium dies, or even probably when it's alive too and can't fend for itself  really, it only can really defend through the release of chemicals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:31:44">0:31:44-0:32:01</a>:</strong>  It doesn't have appendages or anything like that or fingers or mouths or anything.  Insects do come along and micro insects and things in the soil and other microbes will  eat the fungal tissue and just chomp right through it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:01">0:32:01-0:32:15</a>:</strong>  The tissue passes through the digestive tract of the insect, becomes its waste.  Other microbes then come and eat that waste, and here's a big part of the soil web.  But generally the fungi, they can't really fight off insects so much other than maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:15">0:32:15-0:32:27</a>:</strong>  trying to create noxious compounds and things.  Generally their defense mechanism is, as I said, the release at their growth tips as  they're growing into a branching network.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:27">0:32:27-0:32:37</a>:</strong>  And at the tips, all kinds of chemicals are being released, including antibiotics, antifungal  compounds to fight off other fungi that might want to attack it.  There are fungi that do hurt other fungi and can penetrate and kill them while they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:37">0:32:37-0:32:47</a>:</strong>  alive, which we can actually talk about that as an important group of soil fungi.  And then also antivirals.  So there are viruses that can attack fungi.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:47">0:32:47-0:32:58</a>:</strong>  But there, I like to think of fungi as nature's greatest chemist.  And I know a lot of plant folks won't necessarily agree with that, but a lot of the chemistry  inside of plants we're finding is actually produced not really by the plant, but at least<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:32:58">0:32:58-0:33:12</a>:</strong>  directly or initiated to a pretty good degree by the internal fungi inside of the plant.  And that's just a whole new realm of discovery and a different discussion perhaps.  But so they're just incredible chemists, I guess, is a short story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:12">0:33:12-0:33:27</a>:</strong>  And part of that is exemplified through their ability to defend and adapt and grow in all  conditions largely through, essentially entirely through the production of their unique host  of and suite of chemicals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:27">0:33:27-0:33:40</a>:</strong>  For a lot of the fungi that pair up with plants, do you have any sense of how much of the carbon  that makes them up is coming from the plants?  Are they 100% dependent upon those plants to survive?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:40">0:33:40-0:33:52</a>:</strong>  That's where they're getting the carbon.  Or can they synthesize that themselves from other organic matter in the soil?  Well the rule of thumb, when you get introduced to mycorrhizal fungi, we can start there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:33:52">0:33:52-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  The endophytic fungi that live inside of plants, there's just lots of questions around how  they operate and a lot of the nutrient exchange, big, big questions there.  So I can't say so much about those fungi, although I do imagine certainly they're getting<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:15</a>:</strong>  tons of their carbon.  I mean that's essentially their host that's feeding them and then they provide a lot of  effects and compounds to the plant as an exchange.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:15">0:34:15-0:34:25</a>:</strong>  So I'd imagine, I mean I can't imagine where else they'd be on their food actually.  I mean they're getting probably all of it from their plant host in large part.  But as far as the mycorrhizal fungi go, they are much more conclusively studied and much<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:25">0:34:25-0:34:37</a>:</strong>  more directly studied.  And the rule of thumb you'll hear with mycorrhizal fungi, there's seven categories of them.  And the bottom line they always tell you is that all the carbon, the reason it happens<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:37">0:34:37-0:34:49</a>:</strong>  and works is the fungus draws in water and minerals and maybe other nutrients including  say nitrogen from the environment through its vast mycelial network with the high surface  area that I described brings that to its plant partner.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:34:49">0:34:49-0:35:04</a>:</strong>  And in exchange the plant provides excess photosynthesized sugars and that's the tradeoff.  And that does seem to be holding true for most types of fungi.  One of the exceptions, I think one of the better exceptions is, and there's kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:04">0:35:04-0:35:15</a>:</strong>  two, is the arycoid mycorrhizal fungi.  These are the fungi that associate with I'm pretty sure all ericaceous plants, all plants  in the Arokaceae.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:15">0:35:15-0:35:31</a>:</strong>  And these fungi and plants often live in very acidic soils, really extreme northern climates,  heathlands and things like this and bogs.  And the fungi through their chemistry help to buffer the soil pH so that nutrients don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:31">0:35:31-0:35:39</a>:</strong>  get locked up, minerals don't become unavailable.  And at the same time when the plants in the surrounding environment, sometimes you'll  have a heathland that's just all heath pretty much.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:39">0:35:39-0:35:53</a>:</strong>  And when the plant dies the same fungus is the one responsible for digesting the plant.  The plant right next to it or what have you and then feeding it to this other plant.  So in that case they're actually the ones taking in the carbon and moving it and feeding<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:35:53">0:35:53-0:36:01</a>:</strong>  the plant.  The exchange is going the other way that it's not supposed to.  In that case this is another example where the arycoid mycorrhizae have been considered<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:01">0:36:01-0:36:10</a>:</strong>  and called the drivers of these whole ecosystems.  Because without them they are the ones completely essentially creating in large part the carbon  cycle.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:10">0:36:10-0:36:23</a>:</strong>  Sure there is some carbon coming in through photosynthesis but so much of it is being  cycled through the soil and all the chemistry effects via these fungi.  Another good example of how it can go backwards or the wrong way is with the monotrophoid<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:23">0:36:23-0:36:35</a>:</strong>  mycorrhizae.  And these are fungi that are associated with the plants in the monotropa.  The non-photosynthesizing, you know the pink, the white plants, ghost piping things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:35">0:36:35-0:36:47</a>:</strong>  And so these plants are not photosynthesizing yet they're surviving.  They need carbon so they must be getting all of their carbon or the vast majority maybe  a little bit from other microbes or something but the vast majority from their mycorrhizal<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:47">0:36:47-0:36:55</a>:</strong>  partner.  And this association is only formed with a small number of fungi, monotrophoid mycorrhizal  fungi, monotrophoid mycorrhizae.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:36:55">0:36:55-0:37:08</a>:</strong>  But what's curious about them, just to put a twist on it all, is those fungi need to  be getting their carbon from somewhere and so they're not able really to get it out of  the soil rather they are connected over, you know, here's the ghost pipe, here's the fungus<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:08">0:37:08-0:37:18</a>:</strong>  in the middle and over here's the tree.  And the tree comes down, forms what's called an ectomycorrhizal relationship.  The structure looks different, all that's going on in the root fungal interaction is<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:18">0:37:18-0:37:27</a>:</strong>  very different but it's the same fungus and then over on this other end it's the monotrophoid  association.  The structure is different, how it interacts with the root is different, how it looks is<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:27">0:37:27-0:37:37</a>:</strong>  different, same fungus.  And it's essentially a conduit in feeding and keeping these plants alive.  And they frame it as, and they call it a parasitism, they say that these plants are being mycotrophic<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:37">0:37:37-0:37:45</a>:</strong>  and they're feeding off the fungi.  I mean, you know, it's a way to frame it.  I like to think that there's a reason this happens, that the fungi are smart enough or<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:45">0:37:45-0:37:55</a>:</strong>  what have you that as they evolve they wouldn't have let this parasitism to occur.  There are other parasites of course throughout nature and maybe that's all that is but I  like to think there's something to it and some reason they keep these interesting plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:37:55">0:37:55-0:38:09</a>:</strong>  alive and there's some other exchange.  But generally for, you know, the ectomycorrhizal mushrooms, the mushroom and truffle formers  as well as our arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi which are some of our most critical soil fungi,<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:09">0:38:09-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  they seem to be heavily if not entirely dependent on their plant partner for survival primarily  especially through the carbon acquisition.  Yeah, and if we just start talking like that commonly cultivated plants that form relationships<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:40</a>:</strong>  with AB fungi, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, one quote that you have in here is, roots  are essentially porous anchors that primarily stabilize the plants and serve as a beacon  and platform for the beneficial microbes and fungi that actually produce and provide much<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:40">0:38:40-0:38:56</a>:</strong>  of the plant's nutrition.  So let's say we have a plant that needs that AB association with it, we remove that, what  is that plant now left to do on its own and what can it do on its own?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:38:56">0:38:56-0:39:13</a>:</strong>  Is it just photosynthesizing and are the roots not taking in these minerals in the soil because  the microorganisms aren't there to hand them essentially off to the roots?  Can you shed any light on what's going on there?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:13">0:39:13-0:39:29</a>:</strong>  Well I mean you got to again imagine that a root network, we've all seen the diagrams,  they look different, they come in different forms but essentially they're limited to accessing  what's immediately on the right in the exterior of the root.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:29">0:39:29-0:39:40</a>:</strong>  You know there's diffusion, when there's a rain there might be some osmosis or things  dissolve and then it washes over the root and it can sponge up a little more.  That's what happens when we pour liquid fertilizers on our plant, oh it's getting a little bath<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:40">0:39:40-0:39:54</a>:</strong>  of nutrients and it just sponges that up.  I'm sure it could be contradicted by somebody who's much more educated in plant chemistry  but by and large plants aren't releasing many compounds that dramatically transform nutrients<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:39:54">0:39:54-0:40:08</a>:</strong>  and decompose wood matter right into base elements for its survival.  Plants have evolved and we can talk a lot about fungal evolution and it's an open and  shut case for me if we want to get into there but plants have evolved from the beginning<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:08">0:40:08-0:40:23</a>:</strong>  to be entirely dependent on fungi inside and out and some have become better at being what  we call weeds, more surviving without so many other partners and more extreme soils and  things but still they probably have internal fungi for sure and would probably not stray<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:23">0:40:23-0:40:37</a>:</strong>  away from the addition of fungi if they were given the choice.  But you take away the microbes and microbes do a lot of bacteria and stuff of course do  a lot of too but the unique thing about fungi is they're filamentous and you do have filamentous<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:37">0:40:37-0:40:51</a>:</strong>  fungi microbes actinomyces and things that form networks but the way the fungi do it  their structure, their diversity, their chemistry arguably is much richer or the chemical skill  set and their ability to travel so far, connect other plants, move nutrients from one plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:51">0:40:51-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  that's really healthy to a plant that's deficient and that's certainly been shown in lots of  studies talking about that.  You don't really find that so much with the bacteria it's not as a dynamic or complex<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:40:59">0:40:59-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  relationship and so the plants are again from the get-go from day one they've been just  helped heavily by their microscopic partners so why would they have evolved to need to  do anything else?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:26</a>:</strong>  They do their skills well and the other organisms do the other skills.  Now we've come along as humans especially in more recent centuries totally upended that,  protected the soil dynamic, destroyed the soils, removed all these organisms, the plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:26">0:41:26-0:41:40</a>:</strong>  has no shield essentially, no friend to protect it and feed it on its roots so they get root  rot other fungi just essentially come in to shake things up and say this is an unhealthy  system and I need to cause succession which is what they do throughout nature is another<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:40">0:41:40-0:41:52</a>:</strong>  major role of fungi and we try to fight that off and say that they're bad we don't look  at the underlying problem and then we try to bandage it with all kinds of you know of  course chemicals and pesticides and also try to just feed the starving plant and waste<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:41:52">0:41:52-0:42:07</a>:</strong>  a lot of it as a lot of it gets washed into the groundwater or locked up in the soil and  we waste tons of nutrients and phosphorus when from the get-go if we only have you know  the good natural soil that the plants evolved to be in something much more you know rich<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:07">0:42:07-0:42:24</a>:</strong>  all the things we want from soil and then as a part of that a healthy soil community  of all the members of the soil web with fungi being pretty critical in their own unique  ways. So yeah we you know we people often refer to the rhizosphere and but by and large<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:24">0:42:24-0:42:38</a>:</strong>  you know unless you're in a totally sterile soil or in a really heavily you know destroyed  soil where there is no life by and large we're actually should be talking and always thinking  about the mycorrhizosphere and most plants are mycorrhizal especially in a natural setting<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:38">0:42:38-0:42:51</a>:</strong>  and all these dynamics that I'm mentioning are occurring in an incredibly dynamic four-dimensional  relationship. So the succession meaning over time these change every root hair could be  constantly changing in just a few days and other fungus is there and it's a lot going<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:42:51">0:42:51-0:43:07</a>:</strong>  on. So yeah when you lose so yes you can come into your field or your garden and inoculate  with five species from a commercial product you're not nearly gonna have the diversity  you would have in a in a you know more normal soil healthy soil natural soil that has dozens<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:07">0:43:07-0:43:22</a>:</strong>  hundreds of species doing many processes that aren't necessarily directly mycorrhizal but  maybe producing other compounds that stimulate the plants or other microbes and all these  interlocking webs and you know without knowing very much about this we know so little really<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:22">0:43:22-0:43:36</a>:</strong>  about these more complex dynamics we're kind of playing the Russian roulette right where  we take stuff away and think like oh let's just strip it down to its simplest form and  then at some point along the way just everything stops working.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:36">0:43:36-0:43:53</a>:</strong>  Thinking about this there's most plants form these relationships some don't and when it's  in the vegetable world it's brassicas it's it's beets spinach they don't what's theoretically  the reason why they might not form their relationship when the others do?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:43:53">0:43:53-0:44:06</a>:</strong>  Well the the they they sort of trick you there um I thought that for a long time too and  then you look into it and actually and I could be corrected wrong I haven't seen anything  I haven't found the paper that's conclusive saying you know this one plant doesn't do<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:06">0:44:06-0:44:20</a>:</strong>  this but a lot of brassica caseae plants and I would I would not be surprised if all plants  but including brassica casea brassicas form actually a different type of root fungal association  what defines a mycorrhiza so they say it's not mycorrhizal and it's not a true mycorrhiza<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:20">0:44:20-0:44:33</a>:</strong>  what defines a mycorrhiza is that there's sort of three major components there's an  initiation stage a sort of recognition stage that can be measured there's actually chemical  signaling that can be measured between these different fungi and the plant root might change<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:33">0:44:33-0:44:48</a>:</strong>  its structure to accommodate the entering fungus so that can be detected there's a there's  a there's a process once the fungus is inside the root system they'll be and this is the  key component there's sort of a dedicated and defined structure and which is supposed<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:44:48">0:44:48-0:45:05</a>:</strong>  in most cases to be the site of nutrient exchange and then the fungus penetrates the plant root  system to some degree and also has external or hyper hyper radical mycelium essentially  what goes out of the root into the soil so those three things together is what defines<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:05">0:45:05-0:45:21</a>:</strong>  a true mycorrhiza and then we distinguish the seven major varieties of mycorrhiza based  on those three things the process formed the internal structures maybe how the external  mycelium looks and as well as which fungi might be involved but usually more importantly<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:21">0:45:21-0:45:37</a>:</strong>  which plant host is involved like the monotropa or the air caseae is good examples now in  the brazilian brazicas we don't find any true mycorrhiza but what we do often find in a  when possible or healthy enough soil for the plant is what are known as dark septate endophyte<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:37">0:45:37-0:45:54</a>:</strong>  high mice fungi excuse me or dse's dark septate endophytes so endophytes are the fungi that  live inside of plants there are four major categories of them one of them is the dse's  or these and they're only root associating yet root associating the other three varieties<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:45:54">0:45:54-0:46:06</a>:</strong>  are more commonly found in aerial parts of the plant and some of them are found in the  roots to a degree but the dse's are primarily in the roots and they they can be in the root  they can go out to the environment and are probably performing very similar functions<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:06">0:46:06-0:46:19</a>:</strong>  to mycorrhiza they just don't really have a strong initiation moment the root might  not really compromise or rather alter itself for that fungal exchange or this their interaction  and there's no defined structure which is the big thing that they say well it's not<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:19">0:46:19-0:46:37</a>:</strong>  a true mycorrhiza but it's probably performing a very similar function so that's when I sort  of learned about that is kind of like a big haha like haha laughing and also aha moment  so you know again unfortunately the words have sort of been used against us or not used<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:37">0:46:37-0:46:49</a>:</strong>  against us but sort of misleading through the definition and but again it sort of proves  the point that in my mind that fungi have been there and that was what I was referring  to earlier that even the plants we might think of as weeds that don't need them they still<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:46:49">0:46:49-0:47:02</a>:</strong>  have all kinds of endophytes above ground for sure and might very well also have these  other root endophytes that just aren't commonly talked about unfortunately dse's dark septate  endophytes just are really poorly studied so they're actually ecological significance<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:02">0:47:02-0:47:17</a>:</strong>  they're their importance for brassicas and things sadly as with so many other looming  large obvious questions in mycology just hasn't really been thoroughly investigated we can  talk about them I can say maybe a few points but not really much you know there's a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:17">0:47:17-0:47:28</a>:</strong>  of great questions even the viewer just hearing this for the first time might be wondering  about this what about this what about this and just the research might not have been  done yet unfortunately and that's the state of mycology which again is hopefully going<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:28">0:47:28-0:47:39</a>:</strong>  to be changing in the coming years.  Yeah I think that's the thing with a lot of knowledge when we don't know the answer  for sure we say well it doesn't do it because we can't prove that it did we can't run<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:39">0:47:39-0:47:54</a>:</strong>  out of a study to point to that shows that it did we just it might we just don't know  how to interpret it we can't see it we haven't studied it so I think that's really interesting  I mean thinking about this and given your knowledge and familiarity around this subject<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:47:54">0:47:54-0:48:12</a>:</strong>  does this make sense if you were growing brassicas and you wanted to encourage the fungi to come  in that would benefit them you'd want to grow them in the same place as much as you can  like as year-round if possible or depending upon climate like just keep them there more<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:12">0:48:12-0:48:29</a>:</strong>  or less in permanence because you want to propagate those fungi and they always need  a host and that those relationships need to be intact similar with the more common A-B  fungi that are in having relationships with plants let's say lettuce or something like<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:29">0:48:29-0:48:48</a>:</strong>  that you always grow that in the same spot because it needs a live host they cannot even  can sporulate and lay dormant for the next crop but if you're if you're rotating these  crops through brassica to something else and you're breaking up the relationships if we're<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:48:48">0:48:48-0:49:08</a>:</strong>  just looking at the micas or the rhizosphere no micas sphere then are we are we doing damage  by that crop rotation or should we have crops in the same place which contradicts a lot  of traditional ag thinking of crop rotation where we're we're breaking up a lot of these<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:08">0:49:08-0:49:28</a>:</strong>  relationships that are forming below the soil I mean the logic yeah I mean it's I mean it  in my mind draws to what you're you're pointing to a no-till practice and a reduced or different  type of rotation practice perhaps maybe you swap out rather than a completely different<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:28">0:49:28-0:49:42</a>:</strong>  type of plant in a bed it's just a different brassica the following year you know not being  as rich of a plant grower not having nearly as much knowledge about it as yourself or  probably many of your viewers I can only say so much about good plant growing practices<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:42">0:49:42-0:49:56</a>:</strong>  but I have to imagine that a lot of a lot of that knowledge a lot of that insight from  traditional growers developed in this the notion of rotation and all these these things  and tilling came in by witnessing plant root pathogens and and and root rot and all these<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:49:56">0:49:56-0:50:13</a>:</strong>  things coming in and again obviously the notion is you want to move it so that you don't establish  a problematic organism in the soil and I I definitely have to wonder if those things  pop up just like they do in really any system inside of any unhealthy organism in the environment<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:13">0:50:13-0:50:29</a>:</strong>  a predatory fungus or other infectious agent will show up usually because the host is compromised  and in this case not only the plant might be weakened maybe it doesn't have all the  endophytic fungi that it needs and has also evolved to get endophytes are transmitted<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:29">0:50:29-0:50:42</a>:</strong>  in the natural world some live inside of seeds and they're passed through lineages of plants  it's called vertical transmission they carry inside of the seed which I think is pretty  incredible but many of them are also horizontally transmitted meaning that in the spores will<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:42">0:50:42-0:50:56</a>:</strong>  drift from basically growing out of a leaf if you will or when an insect bites a leaf  it gets some of that endophyte moves the next plant and deposits it and then the the beetle  waste or the excuse me the insect waste will land on the plant there's some viable fungal<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:50:56">0:50:56-0:51:12</a>:</strong>  tissue or spores there and literally just grows between the the the leaf cells and starts  to enter the plant that's how these are vertically are horizontally transmitted so in a healthy  forest setting we have such plant diversity every plant and even plants in the same stand<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:12">0:51:12-0:51:25</a>:</strong>  the same species right next to each other they might have a slightly different endophytic  community this might very well be why a healthy otherwise healthy tree has a really unhealthy  branch everything else is fine and the the problem isn't spreading it just maybe that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:25">0:51:25-0:51:38</a>:</strong>  branch didn't get a good assembly of endophytes or it's missing one of them I don't know  and so you know in our monocultures or in a really stripped down agricultural settings  where we don't have all the rich diversity of all the plants and insects and stuff moving<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:38">0:51:38-0:51:52</a>:</strong>  all these endophytic fungi around I wonder if that's a big problem you know that's  that's just one of my hypotheses really hard to measure but it could be tested for  I think in a larger scale and then similarly below ground you know of course yeah we lose<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:51:52">0:51:52-0:52:07</a>:</strong>  the mycorrhizal fungi all the benefits they provide there we we disrupt all the community  that the mycorrhizae also need I mean they know hypha is an island you know they they  need a community to be in and exchange things with not just the one plant one fungus relationship<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:07">0:52:07-0:52:23</a>:</strong>  so certainly the the tillage and the disruption could be playing into that and that's yeah  one of the big arguments with them especially mycorrhizal fungi you're trying to establish  them I mean some of the AM fungi some of the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi they can persist<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:23">0:52:23-0:52:35</a>:</strong>  I mean their their spores germinate and within you know just a week or two they start to  associate with the plant or less and you know within a very short period of time can be  providing benefits to their plant partner and at the end of the season if you till you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:35">0:52:35-0:52:49</a>:</strong>  might lose that that network but if you re-inoculate they'll might very well come back and some  of them also could sporulate if given if you don't till too early and they get a chance  to get to their sporulation stage and some of those arbuscular mycorrhizae can survive<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:52:49">0:52:49-0:53:02</a>:</strong>  tillage though generally they don't really survive going to different soil depths than  they're they're meant to be in their spores that is so you know it's it is a bit of a  debate and of course I wouldn't want to tell somebody that's till dependent to swap switch<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:02">0:53:02-0:53:16</a>:</strong>  tomorrow but it's a big big conversation and I think it kind of again comes back to what  are we what is the actual problem is it that the the root rot is establishing and we got  to sort of run away from them or is it actually is that just a symptom of a greater ill where<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:16">0:53:16-0:53:33</a>:</strong>  the the ecosystem or the sort of ecology of the garden isn't right the the endophytic  community of the individual plant isn't quite right and yeah these are these are looming  questions certainly one in one of the applications one of these sort of leading edge realms of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:33">0:53:33-0:53:49</a>:</strong>  applied mycology more industrial mycology really is creating endophyte inoculum so there  are endophytes that are known to dramatically provide drought salinity heat tolerance to  their host plant individual species have been identified from extreme environments and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:53:49">0:53:49-0:54:06</a>:</strong>  isolated applied to a commercial crop plant in a greenhouse and transmit similar drought  tolerance and so there's of course a lot of interest to applying that globally commercially  as the world heats up things dry out big questions there big concerns come along with that for<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:06">0:54:06-0:54:21</a>:</strong>  me of again us like you say being the tail that wags dog or playing God because if we  push in one fungi are we pushing us something else out we don't really know what we're doing  inside of the fungus when we start to do all this it's a really compelling topic obviously<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:21">0:54:21-0:54:34</a>:</strong>  there's it should be looked at but I just have lots of you know sort of concerns or  reservations around it that are beyond my control someday there's gonna be these commercial  products and people are gonna be using them and they'll work but who knows what the long-term<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:34">0:54:34-0:54:50</a>:</strong>  effect will be just like with all of our pesticides and things that we just you know don't question  yeah so I mean I guess I could go on but you leave it there well tell me if I'm overreaching  here so I used to watch the old school Batman as a kid and Batman would always get in trouble<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:54:50">0:54:50-0:55:08</a>:</strong>  midway through the episode yet he would always win out at the end of the day and I'm thinking  that fungi being the chemists that they are they are Batman they are ever resilient they're  trying to be attacked they're trying to be shut down but they find a way if I just look<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:08">0:55:08-0:55:27</a>:</strong>  outside we look at history nature has evolved there's always this cycle of decay and growth  but plants wouldn't be around the planet wouldn't have evolved if if the bad stuff just had  taken over is it safe to assume or could you could you draw potentially draw this conclusion<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:27">0:55:27-0:55:52</a>:</strong>  that if you had a robust soil and above-ground ecosystem that the power of the fungi would  remove a lot of these bad root pathogens from the equation so you wouldn't get the root  rot you wouldn't get fusarium that if if those relationships were intact and running at full<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:55:52">0:55:52-0:56:10</a>:</strong>  speed and everything was good that the good would win and we'd be all good I mean exactly  I mean if if these if I talked to her was so such an epidemic then you know all plants  it would just be a wave of plant death you know in front of it and nothing could stop<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:10">0:56:10-0:56:25</a>:</strong>  it so what's stopping it when it hits the boundary it's probably helpful fungi that  are well established and protecting their plant partners I mean it's it's a pretty again  kind of an open shut another sort of open shut case for me you just look at the studies<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:25">0:56:25-0:56:40</a>:</strong>  and there's there's decades of research at this point with especially the arbuscular  mycorrhizae as a as a group of mycorrhizae for their ability to to defend and protect  commercial annual crops from phytophthora from fusarium from a lot of them some of the most<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:40">0:56:40-0:56:57</a>:</strong>  common root pathogens tons of research easy to look up you know just the the the problem  is it hasn't been accepted by by big ag for probably any number of reasons and the farm  you know the chemical companies doing their thing but I think it's also bad application<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:56:57">0:56:57-0:57:11</a>:</strong>  is is definitely something I suspect one of the problems and challenges with especially  arbuscular mycorrhizae is a great example is that if you over for you you have the fungus  as inoculum sure but if you over fertilize the plant or actually give it what's sort<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:11">0:57:11-0:57:28</a>:</strong>  of a normal dose for an average farmer it doesn't need the fungus to do the fungal  nutrient provision so the fungus germinates the plant won't take it in the fungus dies  because the the am yeah the fungus it has about seven to ten days after spore germination<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:28">0:57:28-0:57:41</a>:</strong>  to find and be accepted by planos if it doesn't get that it'll just die on the soil so if  you're feeding the plant you know just pouring it on it doesn't doesn't need that fungus  won't waste its resources to feed someone else and then the fungus can't not only die<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:57:41">0:57:41-0:57:57</a>:</strong>  but then it can't provide that shield of protection and all the defense compounds against these  root pathogens so that's a that's a big challenge you can look at the the good research  by the road Dale Institute on some of their suggestions for not only using you know commercial<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=0:59:30">0:59:30-0:59:46</a>:</strong>  soluble form using very strong acids to then create a water soluble form of phosphorus  we can apply to plants on a obviously non-organic approach rather you which is in that whole  approach is essentially mimicking what our vascular mycorrhizal fungi and phosphorus<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:15">1:00:15-1:00:28</a>:</strong>  to experiment more unfortunately but that would be yeah as you're sort of saying you  wouldn't be wasting what you wouldn't have you'd help reduce especially these inputs  there and if there's enough kind of going around enough organic matter and all the other<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:00:28">1:00:28-1:00:42</a>:</strong>  sort of food sources and all the all the compost we would love to give otherwise you would  you would be hoping that the fungi and other food web organisms would be turning all up  so we wouldn't have to put in so much more and as the byproduct the plant is well protected<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:36">1:02:36-1:02:51</a>:</strong>  of their difficulty but you know too much to my and maybe many of your listeners surprise  when was last time you heard about trichoderma maybe this audience especially more of them  have heard about it but most people haven't in I do see it in the stores you do see you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:02:51">1:02:51-1:03:05</a>:</strong>  know might not say trichoderma I want to picture this kind of not so pretty mold but if you  see a fungal additive and often with mycorrhizal additives they'll incorporate trichoderma  as one of the fungi which is not a true again try to true mycorrhizae so you might actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:05">1:03:05-1:03:16</a>:</strong>  get benefit out of the product but was it the arbuscular mycorrhizae those product the  benefit or was it actually the trichoderma because it was able to survive it's a question  I have about these commercial products maybe a little bit deceptive in some way which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:16">1:03:16-1:03:30</a>:</strong>  I mean it's fine you're getting so fungi in your soil in you know all better for it I  just wish there was you know better practice more awareness on the on the user end so that  you know as awareness and sort of culture on this grows we can have better more informed<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:30">1:03:30-1:03:47</a>:</strong>  discussions yeah I guess I'll leave it there you know a lot of people want to speed this  up they want to add something to the soil and put it there assuming it's not there to  begin with in a lot of cases in bad practices it's not there to begin with do you do you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:03:47">1:03:47-1:04:05</a>:</strong>  have enough faith in nature that if you start growing that these things fungi the trichoderma  they will show up even if you're not trying to put them there by doing you know these  more regenerative practices you're not using chemicals you're not using fungicides you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:05">1:04:05-1:04:22</a>:</strong>  using crops that are putting a lot of sugars and exudates into the soil my thought is eventually  like that's going to look attractive to fungi however it gets there it's going to find a  way to get there and say you know I want some of this yeah I mean fungi will always find<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:22">1:04:22-1:04:38</a>:</strong>  a way it's just again we have opposable thumbs and a prefrontal cortex to to speed up what  nature would would do over a much longer period of time you know again learning to grow a  mold on some old you know newspaper or wheat brand just like indigenous microorganisms<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:38">1:04:38-1:04:51</a>:</strong>  something or even simpler just needs maybe to become the another tool in the toolbox  for for folks already doing all these other great skills you just mentioned you know growing  the mold is maybe one of the simpler ones it just becomes another amendment by and large<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:04:51">1:04:51-1:05:08</a>:</strong>  you know as much as I've seen there's really no there's we're not really concerned about  the trichoderma negatively impact impacting crops so you know unless you have like a really  healthy soil fungal my chorizo community you know maybe you don't need to add the the trichoderma<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:08">1:05:08-1:05:20</a>:</strong>  there but again if your soil is fairly depleted you're tilling all the time you probably don't  have a lot of established fungi at least doing a little test plot with these trichoderma  there's really no risk there and and certainly well worth it and you can buy products that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:20">1:05:20-1:05:37</a>:</strong>  have it but learning to grow it yourself is maybe something to look into there's even  methods I mean a bigger concept with with soil and fungal soil inoculum is and the research  shows this to be true is that rather than buying commercial products even though they<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:37">1:05:37-1:05:55</a>:</strong>  might have a well developed strain or varietal of a given fungus which shows and their work  to be the best one there's a lot of argumentation around well that might be the case harvesting  one locally from your local soil system and climate is and then learning to propagate<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:05:55">1:05:55-1:06:13</a>:</strong>  that out through you know beginner to intermediate techniques is much more worth it and they're  more fine-tuned to the soil ecology the climate again elevation all this stuff and and in  some cases especially in more endemic and rare plants that I've seen studies where the<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:13">1:06:13-1:06:28</a>:</strong>  commercial products did not work and when they harvested the local fungi from the you  know special biome or what have you propagated it out in the greenhouse and brought it back  then the plant survived whereas the commercial soil inoculum you know may even had a negative<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:28">1:06:28-1:06:43</a>:</strong>  effect I've seen that so again more nuances there so you might get all these false negatives  or or even a false positive where you think it's the AM fungi but it's actually trichoderma  in the mix or something but so where we it all adds up to maybe more confusion than I<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:06:43">1:06:43-1:07:00</a>:</strong>  would like but I think we'll eventually just be clarified as more people you know learn  about it and sort of delineate all the terms and and sometimes even though people call  you know the wrong type of fungus the wrong thing and you know just terminology is is<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:00">1:07:00-1:07:12</a>:</strong>  the stumbling block but we'll we'll get over that in not too much time.  Well that's it I mean a lot of this seems intimidating and I think a lot of people get  like in the weeds really quick in terms of knowledge but I think you go out there you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:12">1:07:12-1:07:31</a>:</strong>  try stuff and and you learn from it and along those lines one way to add beneficial microbes  and soils through compost and and one thing I see a lot I see a lot of people commenting  on this on YouTube is they're always wanting to speed up compost and from talking to people<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:31">1:07:31-1:07:49</a>:</strong>  like Dr. Elaine Ingham her belief is that a lot of soils are more a lot of agricultural  soils are heavily bacterially dominated and we need to move that closer to a one-to-one  fungal to bacterial ratio where a lot of plants like it so a lot of these quick composts the<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:07:49">1:07:49-1:08:04</a>:</strong>  theory this is my theory kind of piecing together a lot of knowledge is you're composting stuff  real quickly using manures and grass clippings and stuff like that you're getting a lot of  bacteria in there you're not giving fungi the time to go in to really develop to increase<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:04">1:08:04-1:08:22</a>:</strong>  the diversity to increase the amount and you're not giving really them the food that they  want so if I'm create a quick compost and I'm done in 30 days it might look great it  might be this brown stuff is it safe to assume that time is needed to develop the fungi that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:22">1:08:22-1:08:39</a>:</strong>  are going to benefit the soil or using quick compostable ingredients and a lot of turning  where you're generating all this heat do you think you can build up fungi in a pile like  that given your knowledge of fungi and how they proliferate?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:39">1:08:39-1:08:56</a>:</strong>  Well I mean you know the first question is what what kind of fungi I mean there's there's  a anywhere from 1.5 to 6 million fungal species in the world you know and and many of them  live in the soil so that's one of these things I always think about with well we just need<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:08:56">1:08:56-1:09:12</a>:</strong>  more fungi in our soil what kind and there's a huge questions there because we can we can't  isolate some fungi the soil as I said early on and there's there's easy ways to do that  even the simpler molds and things you know trichoderms one but there's many other molds<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:12">1:09:12-1:09:24</a>:</strong>  you can isolate from the soil and look at and name but then you ask okay well what's  it doing and so what's its ecological role I don't know it's probably a decomposer you  know that's that's what I've been told in some more advanced workshops and things have<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:24">1:09:24-1:09:37</a>:</strong>  taken and looking into the literature it's just this is what it is is how we name it  it's like okay well what's it doing and it's it's just because again like you I think said  earlier we just we don't actually know it's not anybody's real fault it's just that even<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:37">1:09:37-1:09:52</a>:</strong>  after decades looking at it's about as far as we've come so and I greatly respect Dr.  Lingham's work it's just one of the things I've always thought there when I've seen some  of her work and some of the people that referenced it and things is just sort of vague references<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:09:52">1:09:52-1:10:05</a>:</strong>  and again it's it might just be that you know she doesn't know what fungi she's seeing it's  actually quite difficult inexpensive to sequence it and get the genetics so you just look into  my sim and try to make broad categorizations which I totally understand but if we're you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:05">1:10:05-1:10:17</a>:</strong>  know I definitely in the future of love just like with indigenous microorganisms and some  of the Korean natural farming stuff where they're just growing wild molds and adding  it in you know I'd love to see more fine-tuned research which I hear is occurring in that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:17">1:10:17-1:10:28</a>:</strong>  realm to figure out exactly which species are going on and because once we know that  we got we don't know what we're talking about we gotta get our basic grammar down in our  terms and which species and then we can look at well and then study them individually you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:28">1:10:28-1:10:40</a>:</strong>  know under control settings they prefer this type of food you know they have a preference  for you know there's many different foods in the soil and which ones are eating what  and then ultimately when we and then which ratio do we want of these dozens of different<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:40">1:10:40-1:10:54</a>:</strong>  fungi and now that's obviously quite complex way too far in the future for us right now  when we just want to make it happen but that's where I think we need to start thinking at  least this is where my mind goes with it as far as going back to what your question was<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:10:54">1:10:54-1:11:05</a>:</strong>  there is lots of fungi and compost there have been I've actually only found one study and  maybe there's something new that I haven't come across but I looked in this a number  of times over the years of okay fungi and compost because you get this question every<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:05">1:11:05-1:11:22</a>:</strong>  so often there's one that I found where they did all the work they made a normal aerobic  compost pile and then they also had vermin compost and they compared the fungal communities  in both and there was mostly what is just concluded was there was I think 120 in one<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:22">1:11:22-1:11:34</a>:</strong>  group and 150 different species or taxa and the other group and there was a good bit of  overlap and that was pretty much the conclusion of the paper again not a real strong conclusion  which one's doing what and which one do we want and when it comes out of the soil or<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:34">1:11:34-1:11:48</a>:</strong>  out of the compost pile which one's surviving the soil and do the good things there you  know so and ultimately there isn't some perfect protocol to get the most perfect fungi because  we still don't even necessarily know which of these mini micro fungi that we find in<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:11:48">1:11:48-1:12:04</a>:</strong>  compost and soils and molds rather are the good ones so again it's a roundabout way of  me saying I don't know but it's sort of the line of thinking we you know just we need  to realize that that we don't know and I think it's really important in the realm of mycology<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:04">1:12:04-1:12:19</a>:</strong>  in all sciences and things to really actually really acknowledge what we don't know so that  the next generation or ourselves can actually answer the question rather than coming up  with sort of simple or shorter sort of little snippets and for simplicity sake that it eases<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:19">1:12:19-1:12:34</a>:</strong>  the conversation but it doesn't propel the harder thinking that we kind of need especially  in this topic which is obviously very important you know in as much as you know how can we  get the you know again cultivate more fungi in our soils and things it comes back to some<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:34">1:12:34-1:12:51</a>:</strong>  of the stuff that I was talking about in the last with the last question is you know as  far as the molds go they seem to just show up as as compost makers know the more diversity  of sources you get the more diverse organisms you're going to get ideally they're coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:12:51">1:12:51-1:13:04</a>:</strong>  from healthy systems if you're into the Korean natural farming thing where you're basically  harvesting wild molds in the forest using rice that sounds great that's a fairly newer  realm to me and there's not a lot of research there and I don't you know I'd love to see<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:04">1:13:04-1:13:19</a>:</strong>  that further develop in the west and all that to see how because that seems to be obviously  a great notion but as far as you know the best practice to get the most fun in your  compost or in your soil there really isn't a great strategy other than you know I'd follow<br />

Well let me let me hold you there so here's some hard thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:34">1:13:34-1:13:53</a>:</strong>  on that if we look at soil whatever's in the soil when we start is whatever's in there  if we're not tilling and we're we can't get anything a foot deep in the soil a human can't  inject it down into there without tools the only thing that's going to end up in the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:13:53">1:13:53-1:14:10</a>:</strong>  is really what plants and soil macro and micro flora put there and leave there so knowing  that that you're going to have the bodies of organisms in the soil and you're going  to have roots let's say we just when we're done with a plant that we want we cut it off<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:10">1:14:10-1:14:29</a>:</strong>  we leave the roots in the soil and we're going to have all the exudates from plants while  they're growing going into the soil. What does your gut say are the types of fungi you  want to encourage or add to the soil to thrive in that environment knowing that those are<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:29">1:14:29-1:14:49</a>:</strong>  the food sources? I mean you know again it's it's I would want diversity of any kind of  as many fungi as possible you know the unfortunate thing is we because we don't know what we've  lost we don't know what all this human activity for the last several hundred or thousands<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:14:49">1:14:49-1:15:07</a>:</strong>  of years has done to fungal diversity special soil fungal diversity how many species have  we lost and you know which is a much bigger question and you know you again you kind of  bring it back to well so for for that sort of almost from like a philosophical standpoint<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:07">1:15:07-1:15:22</a>:</strong>  I just want more fungal world let's spread more of them and get them to proliferate and  to not lose their diversity even if we don't understand which what an individual species  does you know again you can't and you can't necessarily there's there's not a strong<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:22">1:15:22-1:15:38</a>:</strong>  correlation I guess is to come to try to answer your question is that there I sort of said  this before where we can name a lot of soil fungi but we cannot correlate or connect them  to a greater major ecological function other than just simply oh digest decomposition of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:38">1:15:38-1:15:53</a>:</strong>  you know pollen or something or or an insect shell or something like that and yeah they're  they're eating stuff and they all just kind of eat stuff that's what I've been told by  and large about most soil fungi the only a handful have been really like heavily looked<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:15:53">1:15:53-1:16:07</a>:</strong>  at because their prominence you know I don't know the history of trichoderma there's actually  like it's it's one of these few groups of fungi that's actually gotten lots of attention  I don't I'm curious about the history of that at some point some researcher realized how<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:07">1:16:07-1:16:20</a>:</strong>  common they are and how like strong they are at fighting fungi put two and two together  maybe they could be used in agriculture that's probably something like that and then the  AM fungi rose to prominence amongst the other types of mycorrhizae because of similar reasons<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:20">1:16:20-1:16:34</a>:</strong>  super common they're the most common mycorrhizal type and have all these implications for ecology  and economy so they've been given lots of research but they're they're this you know  these are some of the shining stars the vast majority fungi we just have a name for them<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:34">1:16:34-1:16:46</a>:</strong>  and that's just about it so you know what are they doing which ones we want to kind  of I was sort of saying this before which ratio and and how which what food do they  need to grow the best we really don't know I mean and I'm just be shooting in the dark<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:16:46">1:16:46-1:17:01</a>:</strong>  to say anything other than let's you know mirror nature is the best I can come up with  my one of the things I was gonna say before and sort of going on the compost question  and my friend said this and it's just an interesting notion it kind of comes to what you're saying<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:01">1:17:01-1:17:18</a>:</strong>  but maybe just a derivative of the last question is he points out that with compost especially  cold compost low compost you get a lot of smell and that's implying that the the bacteria  there it's it's rotting it's you're losing nutrients and things are escaping as gases<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:18">1:17:18-1:17:32</a>:</strong>  through scent sulfur and things with fungal growth generally you know you very rarely  get much of a scent you get an earthy scent often you know the worst you get that sort  of musty fungal scent and not so much in compost either right and usually a good healthy compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:32">1:17:32-1:17:48</a>:</strong>  it smells good and you can see and we can test we see lots of fungi and and especially  mushroom cultivation we there is very there's not a noxious scent for whatever that means  at least it doesn't trigger us to not like it and but also not a very strong scent generally<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:17:48">1:17:48-1:18:03</a>:</strong>  coming off of mushrooms or their mycelium so his notion is that they're much they're  much better at conserving nutrients fungi don't waste through gas no compost you don't  you don't really smell as much bad stuff per se but you know you got I don't know a lot<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:03">1:18:03-1:18:17</a>:</strong>  of steam coming off maybe there's some things coming away some stuff leaching out you know  definitely so you know his argument in this is sort of just leaving it on the table for  everybody to consider is maybe in the future our composting systems broadly need to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:17">1:18:17-1:18:33</a>:</strong>  much more fungi based like heavily fungi based than bacterially based or at least they we  need to do that right alongside our hot compost bacteria piles and we would not only be cultivating  you know the edible mushroom mycelium but really have a whole new system of just growing<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:33">1:18:33-1:18:47</a>:</strong>  lots more kind like what IMO indigenous microorganisms does we just grown lots of mycelium mold mycelium  they start out with a little box of rice and they expand it through a bunch of steps maybe  in the future we'll have a larger scale more elaborate version of that that everybody does<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:47">1:18:47-1:18:59</a>:</strong>  on their farm or in their backyard which would be really interesting and I don't know what  that looked like I don't know what species would be there what methods would be included  but we can imagine certainly that that I mean it sounds good sounds right sounds like we<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:18:59">1:18:59-1:19:15</a>:</strong>  should be doing that yeah I mean it's interesting you say that now I'm thinking as we're talking  here it's almost as though nobody should fall in love with one style of composting whether  that's long form cold composting or short quick hot composting because if you think<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:15">1:19:15-1:19:33</a>:</strong>  about what is in the soil you're gonna have all stages you're gonna have some young plants  that die you're gonna have some tree roots that are old and eventually they die and you're  gonna want fungi that can handle all ends of the spectrum so composting materials that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:33">1:19:33-1:19:51</a>:</strong>  can break down very fast gives you the expansion of one type of fungi composting materials  that are a little bit tougher to break down gives you another type of fungi and then composting  very woody material gives you another type of fungi and you you have some amount of piles<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:19:51">1:19:51-1:20:10</a>:</strong>  that are all managed differently based on the ingredients because they're all breeding  out different fungi and then you add all that to the soil and they'll figure it out but  you're never just overloading on one or becoming beholden to one because we don't know yeah<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:10">1:20:10-1:20:24</a>:</strong>  I mean it's I mean nature isn't that simple it's you make a great point I mean you're  essentially describing decompositional succession which is what we we see on a rotting log you  get many waves of different types of fungi that come throughout the the many stages of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:24">1:20:24-1:20:39</a>:</strong>  wood decay it's not just one silver bullet fungus doing it all you know again they all  they all work in concert there is fungi can do a lot they can't do everything and definitely  not one species can do everything and so this is certainly how we need to start thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:39">1:20:39-1:20:52</a>:</strong>  about it they it's one of the common things I encounter with with people new to mycology  or even sometimes someone invested in it is it for whatever reason maybe it's part of  our society or something we want to whittle it down to that you know again the magic pill<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:20:52">1:20:52-1:21:07</a>:</strong>  or something and just sort of this is the one to do it all or it's an easy way to talk  about things sometimes or wrap our brains around it but you got to think systematically  bigger picture you know ecosystem picture and yeah I mean that's what you just described<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:07">1:21:07-1:21:22</a>:</strong>  is really it's you're just mirroring what we find in decomposition is is many organisms  and especially as far as the fungi go which I know a lot more about than the bacteria  something it's we have lots of stages there so yeah that would probably be the way to<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:22">1:21:22-1:21:38</a>:</strong>  go and and the system that does that will probably look a lot different and be more  static than than like a hot compost pile in in that maybe it's more you know carbon heavy  and much lower than nitrogen to to try to limit the amount of you know bacteria coming<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:38">1:21:38-1:21:52</a>:</strong>  in to to do their thing.  Thinking about fungi and you were saying that they're very thrifty they're not wasting a  lot when they're breaking down one thing people use a lot to measure compost piles is heat<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:21:52">1:21:52-1:22:11</a>:</strong>  in your experience do you notice any output of heat from fungal breakdown and this could  be even observed in like a edible mushroom cultivation lab are fungi essentially not  raising the temperature or are you seeing temperature increases when they start to break<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:11">1:22:11-1:22:23</a>:</strong>  down and let's just say wood.  Well yeah absolutely no it's a common issue in a mushroom farm my farm is actually just  kind of right behind me right behind this wall but we in the incubation room where the<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:23">1:22:23-1:22:38</a>:</strong>  mycelium is growing on the material there's lots of metabolism lots of cellular chemical  energy going on and that is dissipated as heat and so you actually have to separate  the grow bags from each other because if they're right against each other excuse me they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:38">1:22:38-1:22:51</a>:</strong>  right against each other they will can cook each other and hurt each other through so  much heat so it can get quite warm in the incubation stage and you have to ventilate  and to lower the temperature so that's that's definitely happening through the natural to<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:22:51">1:22:51-1:23:07</a>:</strong>  just let the heats more readily dissipated depending on the substrate.  What's the hottest you'd want that to get?  Well in the mushroom cultivation we for most mushrooms we're growing incubating usually<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:07">1:23:07-1:23:21</a>:</strong>  we try to maintain it anywhere from 70 to 75 some species you know you might go 80 85  but usually when you get to that temperature you're actually putting in energy in like  a temperate part of the world where I live you usually need an input energy to get warmer<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:21">1:23:21-1:23:37</a>:</strong>  the warmer that it is the faster they'll grow so anyway and depends on how full your room  is your incubation space you might not even need an input then you actually need to cool  down so but in the 70s is a good incubation temperature in a compost pile I mean there<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:37">1:23:37-1:23:52</a>:</strong>  are thermophilic fungi that can survive higher temperatures a lot of fungi are mesophilic  just like us we like to live it you know what we consider normal warm temperatures we die  above I forget 120 or something like that and same with mesophilic fungi but there are<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:23:52">1:23:52-1:24:06</a>:</strong>  then thermophilic fungi that that primarily live at warmer temperatures and in compost  piles and in other thermal vents and things like this warmer environments.  Yeah and thinking about you know decomposition wood chips are one thing that's really common<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:06">1:24:06-1:24:24</a>:</strong>  and this is something that it comes up a lot I've toyed around with this I'm presenting  the problem here I'm gonna give you a pile of fresh hardwood wood chips so it's a blend  of leaves and branches all ground up and you want to break them down as fast as possible<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:24">1:24:24-1:24:37</a>:</strong>  that's that's the goal that's what we're trying to do and we can't reduce the particle size  by grinding them finer just is what it is how would you go about doing that or how would  you think about doing that if you wanted to speed it up?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:37">1:24:37-1:24:55</a>:</strong>  I mean the definitely though my go-to would be your your ever ready ever willing garden  giant mushroom staupharia rugosa anyulata especially with the substrate you described  I mean that mushroom if any of your listeners or yourself has grown it if unless you you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:24:55">1:24:55-1:25:14</a>:</strong>  know pour poison on it you know it'll rip through almost anything especially fresh wood  chips but your turnaround there I mean it just raw wood chips is a good example it might  still take two years two seasons for it to really become essentially topsoil so it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:14">1:25:14-1:25:32</a>:</strong>  not by your depending on your your standards your your meter might not be super quick relative  to spread those out in a wood lot I mean it's incredibly quick it might take you know many  years for that to really fully break down to be not as visible or so that's a good mushroom<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:32">1:25:32-1:25:52</a>:</strong>  you know again going through the systems we were just sort of discussing perhaps we need  a better system the right targeted complex of of molds and well not so much molds are  good for for wood decay but rather the white and brown rot wood decaying species which<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:25:52">1:25:52-1:26:08</a>:</strong>  are typically more mushrooms and larger larger more evolved fungi and the staupharia is one  I have a lot of experience with it's just such a killer mushroom just eats kind of anything  so fast but there might very well be there's roughly 2,000 white rot species and about<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:08">1:26:08-1:26:21</a>:</strong>  200 brown rot species and you know maybe there's some that are out there that are just not  commonly cultivated they're not even edible the fruit body the mushrooms aren't edible  not a lot of human history but the mycelium would just rip through those chips like no<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:21">1:26:21-1:26:36</a>:</strong>  one's business way more than staupharia that'd be great to find out great question again  don't we don't have that great protocol the refined protocol in that approach just that  makes total sense there's a lot of species to trial there probably some obvious choices<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:36">1:26:36-1:26:51</a>:</strong>  if if I was to kind of go through the list to start with but I haven't seen anybody do  a sort of comparative study with something like that if you were in a lab and you could  control the temperature on that pile is there a temperature you'd push it towards to try<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:26:51">1:26:51-1:27:08</a>:</strong>  and speed up the rate well probably for like a white rot species I mean they're they're  growing on trees and so they're not going to be like in a hot compost pile or some sort  of decaying pile of organic matter in the natural setting so it's going to be a more<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:08">1:27:08-1:27:23</a>:</strong>  or less mesophilic temperature range meaning from rough it's going to be within that range  which is on the low end you know the 30s up to little over a hundred most mushrooms where  we have a lot more data which is where all the cultivation you know the lion's share<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:23">1:27:23-1:27:41</a>:</strong>  of our cultivation knowledge comes from is the gourmet species edible species and medicinals  the majority of them they they're sort of have a sort of a growth curve or an optimal  growth temperature and they grow a lot slower at lower temps maximums roughly in the 70-75<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:41">1:27:41-1:27:55</a>:</strong>  degrees for a lot of species and then you get diminishing returns with higher heat so  it would depend on the species that we would try on this hypothetical experiment but to  throw its mycelium in there keep it moist you're just trying to get the mycelium to<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:27:55">1:27:55-1:28:07</a>:</strong>  grow you don't care about the fruit bodies in this example which is great growing the  fruit body getting the fruit body to form is the hardest part of farming mushroom farming  growing mycelium is super easy so long as you keep it from drying out and don't make<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:07">1:28:07-1:28:21</a>:</strong>  things too dirty where it has to spend a lot of energy fighting off competitors you create  the right conditions where all it can do all it does is mostly just eat eat eat and good  nice food like you described is a good starting place right amount of Goldilocks water and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:21">1:28:21-1:28:33</a>:</strong>  you know good temperature which I would yeah as a starting place would be 75 but depending  on the species might be a little bit warmer or something in terms of moisture that's another  point that a lot of people talk about I mean you want it drier do you want it wetter is<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:33">1:28:33-1:28:49</a>:</strong>  it that wrong sponge amount of water yeah typically I mean again pointing to mushroom  cultivation and this is what we find with growing the majority of molds and and other  micro fungi on substrates is you're you're going for the depending on the substrate it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:28:49">1:28:49-1:29:04</a>:</strong>  a it doesn't always apply actually by definition but the phrase that's thrown around is field  capacity where it's essentially it's holding as much water as possible without so much  filling the void spaces with large water droplets so there's still a bit of microscopically<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:25">1:29:25-1:29:42</a>:</strong>  meaning that if you take a hundred grams of the material and you've hydrated it to the  point you think it's done and then you dehydrated in the oven it would come out at say 35 grams  we've lost 65 grams of water meaning that it was at 65 percent moisture content so those<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:29:57">1:29:57-1:30:13</a>:</strong>  weren't totally sure of was oxygen rate relative to the decomposition rate but in thinking  about you know an anaerobic pile in the center of that pile there's either low oxygen or  there's no oxygen because it's just can't get there are there fungi that can operate<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:13">1:30:13-1:30:32</a>:</strong>  in ultra low oxygen environments so if you did have that pile go anaerobic could there  be some fungi that could operate in there or do they have to wait for the anaerobic  bacteria and other organisms to kind of run the course and then soil organisms come in<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:32">1:30:32-1:30:53</a>:</strong>  aerate that and then the fungi go in well I mean yeah there's a great example is the  yeast that makes our beers and breads it's an anaerobic species yeast our fungi they're  single-celled the 99.8 percent of fungi probably are filamentous having a network of mycelial<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:30:53">1:30:53-1:31:08</a>:</strong>  tissue a tiny amount are single-celled yeasts but the yeast that makes our beer and bread  is is an anaerobic species there's yeast all over wild plants wild fruits there's yeast  everywhere we know very little about the role of soil yeast which is a category of soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:08">1:31:08-1:31:27</a>:</strong>  fungi very poorly studied the soil there's yeast throughout the oceans which is there's  dissolved oxygen in oceans obviously so the fish can breathe but it's very low oxygen  levels you know lower depths and things so there are in and there's anaerobic there's<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:27">1:31:27-1:31:42</a>:</strong>  fungi that can also survive filamentous fungi that can survive in anaerobic conditions now  again the actual dynamics of which fungi are in those anaerobic cores at which time during  the compost succession and progression I don't know in I don't know if that I haven't seen<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:42">1:31:42-1:31:58</a>:</strong>  like a paper that's really studied that or looked at that specific question could be  interesting and there's some fungi that can also switch between normal respiration and  fermentation to to to get their you know chemical energy so but a lot of fungi tend to prefer<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:31:58">1:31:58-1:32:23</a>:</strong>  an anaerobic or excuse me aerobic environment say that pile runs its course it's now top  soil we add that to the soil at that point are we just providing nutrients for the soil  organisms to feed from where now the a B fungi can go target those and transfer them over<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:23">1:32:23-1:32:44</a>:</strong>  to the plant as needed because if the decomposers are done in theory there's nothing left for  those fungi to eat they go away so are we adding fungal food I guess is what I'm trying  to say when we add that broken down wood chip pile to the soil I mean I don't think the<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:32:44">1:32:44-1:33:00</a>:</strong>  decomposers necessarily go away if you move them from you know the pile over here to the  garden bed over there there might be you know new stuff for them to eat there kind of just  depends I mean unless you really like pasteurize the compost after processing or after running<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:00">1:33:00-1:33:14</a>:</strong>  it then yeah you'd kill most the organisms through say a pasteurization process but they're  not just gonna go even you know the mixing it up and sort of diluting it if you do that  with your compost you know some of the some of the tissue will survive their mold spores<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:14">1:33:14-1:33:29</a>:</strong>  will survive but they again it kind of just comes back to this big unknown question of  you know how many are so I've been which ones survive and then you know who's who's feeding  off of what you know the fungi that are already in the soil how much are they what are they<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:29">1:33:29-1:33:44</a>:</strong>  doing with the compost that comes in on a nitty-gritty level I mean we can see positive  effects like we can say yeah we had to soil the plant grows better and the the fungus  the the arbuscan mycorrhizae are accessing it and helping to some degree but to a certain<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:33:44">1:33:44-1:34:00</a>:</strong>  degree a lot of the conclusions you read in these types of studies is just sort of saying  we did this and this happened that the exactly why and how is maybe decades of in PhDs worth  of actually looking really hard and deep to understand all the mechanisms involved and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:00">1:34:00-1:34:18</a>:</strong>  all the players involved in steps so I don't know I mean again it's these are all vague  my answers are always can only be so conclusive with stuff like this because I don't think  we really do know enough unfortunately at this point human history.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:18">1:34:18-1:34:35</a>:</strong>  What about this say you're doing all the things that you should be doing your growing plants  you're adding some compost to the soil but you want to feed the fungi in the soil not  from compost are there things that you could add to the soil from the top to get the fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:35">1:34:35-1:34:52</a>:</strong>  that are there working and yeah working along like something you could pour on top is it  fish emulsion is it something else that could be a fungal food that might not be in the  soil at the start?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:34:52">1:34:52-1:35:12</a>:</strong>  I mean there's a great book by Michael Phelps, Phillips, Micro-Risal Planet I believe and  it's one of the few books that's come out last few years on kind of translating all  the technical literature on mycorrhizal fungi to a more lay person he's an orchardist first<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:12">1:35:12-1:35:27</a>:</strong>  and foremost and so the book is really written so that you provision the soil to feed the  mycorrhizal fungi so that the plant benefits and he discusses quite a number of things  in there and that's a lot of this notion is he makes these sort of suggestions and arguments<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:27">1:35:27-1:35:41</a>:</strong>  and let's add you know different fatty acid sources I believe may fish emulsion is in  there and it's a lot of kind of good ideas and the logic is pretty good but you know  he doesn't really have much citations I don't think this stuff has actually really been<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:41">1:35:41-1:35:54</a>:</strong>  trialed and as far as I was able to draw from the book I don't know how much you know maybe  he does it in his field and this is his notion he thinks this is what's going on but again  if you want to whittle it down to where's the numbers where's the science I don't think<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:35:54">1:35:54-1:36:08</a>:</strong>  we have a lot of that I don't think he necessarily has so much more it's anecdotal at this stage  so that's a good book I would refer to for a really you know a lot of the book is dedicated  to this thinking so definitely give him credit for all that and suggest people check that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:08">1:36:08-1:36:21</a>:</strong>  out but a lot of what he's referring to is just you know beyond that is sort of I think  more speculative the actual protocols you know he suggests there is a lot of it's coming  from the Rodale Institute I referred to earlier they're one of our few good resources that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:21">1:36:21-1:36:37</a>:</strong>  have actually used USDA money for a number of years to work with farmers in the Northeast  to try a bunch of things especially with arbusco micro azole fungi and just try to make some  progress on this these all these looming questions we have they didn't really look so much I<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:37">1:36:37-1:36:53</a>:</strong>  mean you know again as far as I've seen into this this type of really great question of  what's the best food we add and you know you give it this one and then you get this exact  result I mean that's got to have been done but it's still to date not a great great protocols<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:36:53">1:36:53-1:37:14</a>:</strong>  on it you know I've even been to the International Vesicular Arbusco Micro Azole Culture Collection  in West Virginia it's one of the world's collections of arbusco micro azole spores from all around  the world it's a dedicated lab tiny facility it's such an important thing that people can<br />

Is that something where you could actually request samples from there?<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:14">1:39:14-1:39:29</a>:</strong>  these these hard-hitting questions I for me and just my personality and I think my skill  set really lends more towards the education and it excites me more to await the day when  there's people much more knowledgeable than myself who would advance all this and answer<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:29">1:39:29-1:39:41</a>:</strong>  some of these questions and then you know the science really grows again looking we  have I think again and I made this assumption early on in my interest mycology you just  assume oh lots of people are doing it everybody's figuring out there's a whole world of mycologists<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:41">1:39:41-1:39:53</a>:</strong>  they're gonna do it you can get that sort of a perception you know watching things online  or something like that here and people speak like oh there's so much going on mycology  is just totally blown up everything's gonna get figured out it's like well no actually<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:39:53">1:39:53-1:40:06</a>:</strong>  there's very few people doing it and definitely not enough and it's one of the few sciences  where on all levels of the science the the citizen scientist is actually welcomed you  know and a lot of other sciences they say the you know the academics kind of you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:06">1:40:06-1:40:20</a>:</strong>  look down on the the the amateur you don't have a degree and we you know your your opinion  isn't valid that type of thing not so much in mycology it's like we need more people  we need to do it do the citizen science do it in your backyard write a however good of<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:40:47">1:40:47-1:41:05</a>:</strong>  most important areas of research in in in all ecological studies in many respects.  And people can continue to learn from you with your book Radical Mycology your website  MycoLogos here are some thoughts you know for ways I think people could easily get into<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:38">1:41:38-1:41:58</a>:</strong>  of fungi on those leaves is there a way that's kind of quick and dirty beginnerish easy that  I could take a leaf from a healthy plant cultivate the fungi on that leaf multiply it out and  then go back out into my garden and spray that yeah I mean it's again not a really common<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:41:58">1:41:58-1:42:17</a>:</strong>  protocol but it'd be very easy to take any leaf and you know if you again just being  down and dirty and probably the easiest way to make sure you're capturing something is  to either learn to make or buy for a little bit of a markup online a petri dish made out<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:17">1:42:17-1:42:35</a>:</strong>  of what's known as potato dextrose agar PDA incredibly common fungal cultivation petri  dish medium easy to make but also easy to acquire pre-made and you know you probably  get a stack of them ten bucks or ten plates for I don't know thirty dollars say or somewhere<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:35">1:42:35-1:42:51</a>:</strong>  thereabouts and I would go to try to be the cleanest room of your house maybe your bathroom  if you you know you kind of want to up the level a bit and maybe a little bit above down  and dirty but I try to increase your odds a little bit just go to your bathroom maybe<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:42:51">1:42:51-1:43:05</a>:</strong>  after you take a hot shower or spray the room with some Lysol or just isopropyl alcohol  trying to kind of clean the air a little bit so you don't get mold spores of the air land  random randomly landing on the plate and then go in wash your hands maybe spraying a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:05">1:43:05-1:43:22</a>:</strong>  bit of alcohol isopropyl pharmacy over-the-counter alcohol and just pluck the leaf maybe when  you pluck it in the field put in a clean ziplock bring it to the bathroom and then just sort  of as as best you can put it onto the petri dish and just sort of tap it on there set<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:22">1:43:22-1:43:38</a>:</strong>  it on there sort of rub it around or just sort of do an impression of it and then lift  it off and all kinds of fungi are gonna come all kinds of bacteria as well but you'll definitely  within just a few days especially if you put in kind of a warmer place you know 70-80 degree<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:38">1:43:38-1:43:52</a>:</strong>  room yeah just a couple days you'll start to see stuff growing and really anything fuzzy  is most likely gonna be some of these fungi on the on the on the leaf.  Then once you've done that how do you how do you expand that out what's the next step<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:43:52">1:43:52-1:44:04</a>:</strong>  there you think?  Well you know the there's not like a an easy solution because different ones want different  stuff but the the next step I would try again sort of this simplest approach would be to<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:04">1:44:04-1:44:20</a>:</strong>  just take some wheat bran from the store get it just lightly moistened so you don't want  to overly whatever becomes clumpy and anaerobic and then basically just dump that PDA it'll  come out of the petri dish it's sort of like a gelatin or jello disc or hockey puck almost<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:20">1:44:20-1:44:36</a>:</strong>  and that should just sort of plop out or use a knife to sort of pop it out and just throw  that into the moistened wheat bran and you can do a couple big ziplock bags or even like  a you know like a coffee bag or something a little bit more porous but just so that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:36">1:44:36-1:44:49</a>:</strong>  something so it doesn't really dry out but it can also have a little bit of airflow and  throw that in there you're basically inoculating the wheat bran with these molds and then not  all of them will probably survive maybe one or two will triumph but again in a few days<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:44:49">1:44:49-1:45:03</a>:</strong>  you'll see just myself running through it'll look like a bag of mold and you've cultivated  it and then from there probably just mix it into your your foliar spray you know mixing  system or however you do it it's sort of an inoculation an inoculum there dilute it down<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:19">1:45:19-1:45:35</a>:</strong>  no I love the idea of it it's it's something I might take on it's pretty interesting that  I mean another easy way for people to plug in compost teas what are your thoughts on  that worth the effort are we doing anything are we just making ourselves feel good well<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:35">1:45:35-1:45:49</a>:</strong>  again I mean you know I think people do get really good good effects from it my question  is you know as far as the fungi go which ones are you breeding I know that you know I've  heard that people have tried to make like fungal dominant compost teas and it basically<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:45:49">1:45:49-1:46:05</a>:</strong>  it's it's next to impossible the short periods and especially the really violent for lack  of better word I guess or active aeration that you're supposed to do or just like a  roiling rolling boil that's going to be pretty difficult for a filamentous mycelium network<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:05">1:46:05-1:46:28</a>:</strong>  to establish and even if it can you know when I grow my some in a liquid medium but we agitated  very little and we we oxygenated aerated for just like 30 seconds every few days so that  we don't really rip it apart by so much centrifugal force and disruption so you might be breeding<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:28">1:46:28-1:46:46</a>:</strong>  some some yeast and things in there that could certainly be worthwhile but the what you're  supposed to do to get the bacteria to cultivate in compost tea is not a welcoming environment  I think for most filamentous fungi so you know it's kind of as much as I could say like<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:46:46">1:46:46-1:47:01</a>:</strong>  I said I have been told not too long ago that somebody was trying to to make they'd spent  lots of time and quite a bit of effort to try to make a fungal come fungal dominated  compost tea and just couldn't that yeah that's kind of as much as I could say about it you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:01">1:47:01-1:47:15</a>:</strong>  know again most I think the law of the research in that arena and I haven't looked into it  again nearly as deep as I think some folks I think most of it is more anecdotal by and  large and it's it's people just trialing and getting some good results and things but you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:15">1:47:15-1:47:29</a>:</strong>  know my question is always going to come back to you know I just which fungi are there when  if we're talking about the fungi dang I wish we could measure them and and you know be  more precise on all this but that's my bias I mean in just knowing what you're doing could<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:29">1:47:29-1:47:46</a>:</strong>  you breed out a filamentous fungi in a liquid successfully it sounds like yes and would  you just have to remove that air agitation is that the limiting factor where people yeah  well yeah so exactly so I mean like like I said I don't you know have the right for me<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:47:46">1:47:46-1:48:02</a>:</strong>  to show but it's very common if if listeners aren't familiar with mushroom cultivation  an increasingly popular practice in the last decade is to grow our cultivated gourmet medicinal  material mycelium is one of the earlier stages we grow it in a liquid medium and usually<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:02">1:48:02-1:48:20</a>:</strong>  pint or half gallon glass jars and it's a simple sugar broth you do you have to use  some sterile labby techniques but actually you can do them in your kitchen they've it's  become that simple and there's ways to really DIY it and get good results and but then you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:20">1:48:20-1:48:33</a>:</strong>  you're feeding the mushroom sterile sugar water so there's no competitors that can just  eat eat eat but you have to provide oxygen because the water like a like a fish you need  to dissolve the oxygen so it can breathe underwater and we do that by by stirring it you can do<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:33">1:48:33-1:48:48</a>:</strong>  it by hand by essentially swirling it in your hand in a controlled way to create a vortex  or there's a very common lab tool called a stir plate where beforehand you put a magnetic  stir bar in the jar before you sterilize it and then this plate has a built-in magnet<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:48:48">1:48:48-1:49:06</a>:</strong>  that spins so you spin the bar inside of the jar that causes the water liquid to spin causes  the vortex causes the surface tension of the liquid to to break in air oxygen gas to dissolve  into the liquid so it's very commonplace nowadays in mushroom cultivation to do this and and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:06">1:49:06-1:49:22</a>:</strong>  then we use that as again an early stage in the growing process there's several stages  after that now in this type of discussion yes you could easily translate I mean they  do that industrially this home scale approach is a is a translation a scale down of an industrial<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:22">1:49:22-1:49:38</a>:</strong>  approach to cultivating micro fungi mycelium that's been around for about a hundred years  first developed I think by Pfizer roughly almost a hundred years ago when they learned  that they could cultivate an aspergillus mold in large vats of simple sugar water usually<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:38">1:49:38-1:49:52</a>:</strong>  molasses wastewater and things like this and that fungus produces citric acid in in copious  amounts and they would use simple chemistry thereafter they'd filter out the mycelium  and they would dissolve or precipitate rather not dissolve but precipitate out the citric<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:49:52">1:49:52-1:50:08</a>:</strong>  acid crystals from the liquid that the fungus had released into this nutrient broth and  that notion of basically harvesting fungal exudates is now done commonplace commonly  across all kinds of industries for leather tanning food and textile processing in it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:08">1:50:08-1:50:24</a>:</strong>  in your detergents for your clothes so that's very common on industrial scale and this could  be easily applied for the just the perfect you know fungal foliar inoculum inoculant  or spray at least this is probably this is what they're sort of doing with those endophytes<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:24">1:50:24-1:50:39</a>:</strong>  I was talking about in in short they're essentially taking the fungus isolating it cultivating  it in liquid media and then in these systems I just loosely describe and then they spray  essentially pure mycelium onto the surface of the plant to inoculate it and that's but<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:39">1:50:39-1:50:53</a>:</strong>  these are like kind of targeted endophytes that were originally harvested from the interior  of the plant propagated out and now applied to then they like I said earlier in this talk  they they land on the surface and then they burrow into the plant and establish what you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:50:53">1:50:53-1:51:08</a>:</strong>  talking about are plants that that are epiphytic fungi that live on the surface so they're  not endophytic they're epiphytic and they live on the surface of plants and we're propagating  those and putting them on they're sort of like an above-ground shield whereas the mycorrhizal<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:08">1:51:08-1:51:23</a>:</strong>  fungi are a below-ground shield and so again you know which ones are right which proportions  what's percentages should we just have one probably not which how do we get the good  combo I mean just starting to look at a healthy plant around you and trying to mimic that<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:23">1:51:23-1:51:35</a>:</strong>  maybe using something loosely like what I described of of trying to get it on a petri  tradition growing from there.  So would you spend time with compost seeds or no?<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:35">1:51:35-1:51:47</a>:</strong>  Oh I'm you know I'm not gonna knock it I mean I think people get a lot of benefit I mean  I'm a mushroom grower so I'm not a plant grower so you know I can't speak from lots of personal  experience and trying trying everything and trying to comparison so I will leave it up<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:51:47">1:51:47-1:52:03</a>:</strong>  to to people more experienced in that realm but we have to think about again sort of just  how these fungi function I think is what I'm trying to bring to the table and actually  understanding you know what are we talking about which type of fungi recognizing the<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:03">1:52:03-1:52:16</a>:</strong>  diversity recognizing the lack of knowledge that we do have and then which ones do we  want to propagate do we actually like I said these these companies are trying to they're  propagating endophytic fungi and they're essentially doing a foliar spray but not for the surface<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:16">1:52:16-1:52:28</a>:</strong>  coating that most you know compost tea people are thinking about they're actually cultivating  a fungus that will penetrate into the plant and do something entirely different and you  know that's we can use these same methods I'm describing it's all sort of when you boil<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:28">1:52:28-1:52:42</a>:</strong>  down fungal cultivation no matter the fungus there's only a handful of lab techniques  you need to know to grow them out then it's the question of how do you apply it and then  how does and then and then obviously thereafter you want to do it so it's consistent and gets<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:52:42">1:52:42-1:53:05</a>:</strong>  you the result you want well I think of this in like a nature situation we don't know without  a lot of text what we're breeding how much of it and what it's doing when we add it to  the soil in a lot of cases so maybe the whole mistake around this is is we're looking at<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:05">1:53:05-1:53:27</a>:</strong>  this a little bit upside down stop trying to add stuff to the soil the fungi and instead  provide just a healthy environment for them and let them multiply themselves out and we  do that so we focus on just growing plants have a have a nice ecosystem above ground<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:27">1:53:27-1:53:41</a>:</strong>  which is going to create that ecosystem below ground and just let the fungi take care of  themselves and stop obsessing about us forcing the fungi into the soil and putting the ones  there because we don't really know what we're doing at the end of the day well yeah I mean<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:41">1:53:41-1:53:57</a>:</strong>  again the just the challenge I mean that would for me that's definitely the the end goal  but the the problem is again we don't really know what we've lost and so we don't know  you know which we look at what we see today and okay this seems to be the healthy example<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:53:57">1:53:57-1:54:14</a>:</strong>  or the healthiest pattern and we can look to like a dense forest or something around  where I live and try to but you can't really mimic you know a dense temperate forest for  your for your vegetable garden so what you know is the next best example of that that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:14">1:54:14-1:54:27</a>:</strong>  local as opposed to you know some other part of the world with a different type of ecology  that I'm trying to mimic you know so it is a little bit of you know you you sort of hope  for the best but we but at the end of the day we have stripped away so much so I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:27">1:54:27-1:54:42</a>:</strong>  we do need to bring in some of these fungi because yes in time insect deposits will bring  in a spore here and there they'll drift along the wind spores travel across the ocean on  wind currents the mycelium will travel through the soil the worms will carry it through the<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:42">1:54:42-1:54:59</a>:</strong>  soil and and move spores that way which is how a lot of underground fungi do they rely  on insects and other organisms to move their spores so yes that slowly the drift would  occur things would go where they need to be nature would would find its balance I just<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:54:59">1:54:59-1:55:16</a>:</strong>  don't know how long that might take you know they say in a there's been one study that  I've found that postulated based on you know some studies that in a post disturbance forest  that it would take roughly 40 years for the ectomycorrhizal mushroom populations to more<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:16">1:55:16-1:55:33</a>:</strong>  or less come back to a stable point to where they were pre disturbance that's assuming  that the disturbance wasn't complete deforestation and soil compaction you know if you if you  remove the entire plant community that was essential for you know this type of mushroom<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:33">1:55:33-1:55:48</a>:</strong>  ectomycorrhizal mushroom to live that mushroom won't come back till that plant comes back  and you know how is that plant just going to naturally come back is it going to seed  going to drift in or you know has the entire surrounding been so deforested that is very<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:55:48">1:55:48-1:56:02</a>:</strong>  it's going to take a very long time and very little disturbance by humans for centuries  before sure the tree might be established but you know this is the notion of in succession  where you it's not a circle it's a spiral right you know I think there are patterns<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:02">1:56:02-1:56:15</a>:</strong>  but things things are moving in some sort of direction you know is there there's no  this thing the end goal but there's not true a true complete return that you can never  truly restore an environment I don't I don't like the term restoration because you can<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:15">1:56:15-1:56:31</a>:</strong>  never go back you know we can try to regenerate a disturbed habitat and try to bring it uplifted  and bring it back from being suppressed and you know hurt and things but you have to recognize  there will be a change over and what can we do to make it sort of the next best iteration<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:31">1:56:31-1:56:46</a>:</strong>  of space is only going to be based on the best you know best design best to our knowledge  approach that we have at this point in history and when it comes to the fungi so much that  is shooting in the dark but you know a fallback rule of thumb for me is trying to bring in<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:56:46">1:56:46-1:57:03</a>:</strong>  more as much diversity as possible especially if those diversity fungi is locally sourced  from other fairly healthy nearby environments to again speed up what nature would do in  some sort of geological timescale. No I think that's really well said you know one thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:03">1:57:03-1:57:19</a>:</strong>  that I'm trying to talk to a lot of people about in this series part of it is biocharts  a big topic that comes up a lot just thinking from as a mushroom grower I give you a piece  of charcoal it's it's mostly carbon it's not pure carbon but it's mostly carbon what do<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:19">1:57:19-1:57:37</a>:</strong>  you think fungi look at that like is that a food source is that something they don't  care for is it is it positive is it a net neutral how do you think that's viewed? Well  there's no there's a pretty good amount of research and when you incorporate biochar<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:37">1:57:37-1:57:52</a>:</strong>  or just you know char charcoal into soil systems or different fungal inoculum strategies and  even mushroom cultivation strategies people have used it as a substrate amendment and  by and large the results are usually positive from pretty much everything I've seen I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:57:52">1:57:52-1:58:08</a>:</strong>  in a lot of studies if anything you might find that you know they'll depending on there's  all different ways it's been applied from remediation purposes to plant propagation  to fungal propagation but often the addition of biochar is never really a negative if anything<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:08">1:58:08-1:58:25</a>:</strong>  you might not get much improvement they've certainly looked at charcoal after under a  scanning electron microscope so one of those really high magnification microscopes and  after inoculated with fungi and the fungi are burrowing or you know penetrating into<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:25">1:58:25-1:58:44</a>:</strong>  the all the pores those pores as you probably know are great reserves for water and for  metals and minerals they're charged sites so minerals charged atoms in the soil will  sort of go on and bind to the sites fungi can go in and through their acids and skill<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:58:44">1:58:44-1:59:00</a>:</strong>  set pull out those reserves so you know this is why charcoal is such a great additive in  South America so long ago because it helped it was a nutrient reserve so it by and large  it seems to work well there's definitely been studies showing that in a remediation type<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:00">1:59:00-1:59:18</a>:</strong>  setting that the addition of biochar alongside fungi depending on the the toxin typically  is helpful and then like in the mushroom cultivation setting it usually it's used it's not it's  not bioactive it's not like soaked in compost tea to be full of bacteria that would be antagonistic<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=1:59:18">1:59:18-1:59:32</a>:</strong>  to the mushroom mostly it's just the actual char the porous material it's beneficial in  this setting where we soak it in water it holds tons of water and it becomes a water  reserve for the mushroom so that in that translates to a higher yield because one of our limiting<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:34">2:00:34-2:00:50</a>:</strong>  led me to write my book which is sort of the book I always wish I'd had growing up it's  the best information my favorite highlights the most useful skills kind of all in one  source and but really in as much as I think it's a great starting place each topic discussed<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:00:50">2:00:50-2:01:07</a>:</strong>  is in itself just a starting place on each of those topics on upon which all of them  I could elaborate so much more and knew that while writing and after the book came out  and was well received realized that you know the next step is to basically take these topics<br />

<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:38">2:01:38-2:01:54</a>:</strong>  certification program we'll be teaming up with universities hopefully the not too soon  future things have been gotten a little bit rough this last six months trying to finalize  some of the things there so that people can get college credit is what we're looking towards<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:01:54">2:01:54-2:02:11</a>:</strong>  but really trying to not just teach sort of one-off classes here and there although certainly  you can take them if sort of like we all first sort of a beginner or hobby level type introductions  to cultivation and mushroom foraging and identification but also more advanced courses so if you really<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:11">2:02:11-2:02:29</a>:</strong>  want to go deep if you really want to understand the stuff we were talking about here for example  is explored as a part of a 14-week fungal ecology deep dive that covers everything nitty  gritty with lots of resources citations field projects so it's trying to be you know essentially<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:29">2:02:29-2:02:45</a>:</strong>  on par with what I would consider college level courses if you could take the more evolved  and more advanced classes but unfortunately those classes don't exist in colleges and  so we're trying to provide this as a real academic learning opportunity but also provide<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:45">2:02:45-2:02:56</a>:</strong>  those beginner classes the you know one of our most popular ones is the one that's just  for the complete beginner you know you may not have heard about mushrooms yesterday and  you just don't even know what's going on and so we definitely have one just to totally<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:02:56">2:02:56-2:03:13</a>:</strong>  start there on the easy step and we just have a few open and available right now but definitely  there are many more to come so folks can definitely join our email list and social to follow along  we're looking towards the end of the year things got sort of paused and delayed for<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:13">2:03:13-2:03:26</a>:</strong>  last little while for current conditions but we're on the upswing and yeah looking forward  to next year if things go go well to do a lot of in-person stuff as well as well as  the online.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:26">2:03:26-2:03:41</a>:</strong>  All right right on man I want to thank you for sharing your knowledge with the world  and taking some time today to do it I love the work you're doing and I hope this inspires  other people to go out there and be the change when it comes to mycology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:41">2:03:41-2:03:56</a>:</strong>  Yeah I mean thank you for having me I mean it's it really is true that you know one of  the things I say and I have said for a long time and really mean is that it's not so much  as true anymore but I think still just depending on the community is that even just being interested<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:03:56">2:03:56-2:04:10</a>:</strong>  in mycology and sharing the stuff you're learning and telling your friends you know tomorrow  which you heard today that is a huge step forward for where mycology needs to go.  I mean in as much as you're able to invest in the knowledge and learn you know the nitty<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:10">2:04:10-2:04:27</a>:</strong>  gritty is up to you but my greatest hope is that we can all just be excited about fungi  be aware of them and help sort of spread the awareness spread and destigmatize them and  embrace them for all their uniqueness so I love going deep you know real deep and into<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:27">2:04:27-2:04:41</a>:</strong>  the weeds a bit on your show where you kind of have a more special platform and an audience  who really loves all the details because that's you know there's a lot to love about fungi  but all this all the details I think for some of the most incredible stuff shines through<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:41">2:04:41-2:04:55</a>:</strong>  so thanks again for letting me go there take everybody there with me.  You know the anecdotal like the citizen scientist claims this I mean that's it's kind of like  I guess the blessing and the curse right like we need it because it's not being done in<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:04:55">2:04:55-2:05:20</a>:</strong>  universities yet some of it is kind of loosey-goosey woo woo and do you spend time and money chasing  that without knowing that somebody isn't just you know making it up.  I mean well I mean if you can you know it's I wish the people were more transparent like<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:20">2:05:20-2:05:32</a>:</strong>  you said I mean I'm happy to admit when I don't know something I mean that's the only  way we're gonna progress as society is people are own up to what we do and do not know as  individual it's just like I don't know I'm more proud of myself if I'm honest with myself<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:32">2:05:32-2:05:46</a>:</strong>  and audience and it helps the student and you know everybody but apparently a lot of  people don't do that so you know I don't really understand that line of thought it doesn't  I don't think it serves anybody other than somebody's you know ego I guess.<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:46">2:05:46-2:05:59</a>:</strong>  Yeah I mean you know the thing about mycology at least in my experience you know part of  the reason I am a little bit more rigid in some respects I used to not be a long time  ago and like my book has tons of citations is because I mean I don't know just the mycology<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:05:59">2:05:59-2:06:15</a>:</strong>  community is in my world is so small and there is every most people are very science heavy  and because we know so little about fungi and there is a lot of confusion around it  I think that the it's kind of clamped down on when because you know the people that know<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:15">2:06:15-2:06:28</a>:</strong>  stuff don't want people spreading wrong facts and getting stuff confused so everybody's  you know checking each other and be like no that's wrong in a helpful way sometimes you  get the ego type people but usually it's just like no we got to get our science really good<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:28">2:06:28-2:06:41</a>:</strong>  because we're not gonna everything's getting all messed up if everybody's spitting wrong  stuff so I was like you know like with the remediation stuff I used to promote that a  lot more and still happy to do that but a huge reality pill I had as well as like well<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:41">2:06:41-2:06:54</a>:</strong>  you know it's only gonna progress if actually people understand like how science and chemistry  and I you know you can throw spawn at something but like who knows if it's working and we  actually do the science about it and it's not as romantic and most people you know most<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:06:54">2:06:54-2:07:15</a>:</strong>  people don't they want the romantic silver bullet easy fix thing that you know they get  sold on YouTube and stuff so it's for what I've tried to just the way that I try to approach  is kind of like how you know talk about it in this talk in other places is trying to<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:15">2:07:15-2:07:27</a>:</strong>  excite people to that that it's also exciting that we don't know enough you know it's it's  frustrating but it's also part of the exciting part that anybody can contribute to it tomorrow  make the next big breakthrough we need more people doing it I didn't maybe emphasize it<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:27">2:07:27-2:07:40</a>:</strong>  quite as much as I could have but that's a big takeaway I always try to give is you can  actually make a huge difference one of the few sciences you know I briefly touched on  it's one of the few sciences where anybody can make can make and we need more people<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:40">2:07:40-2:07:57</a>:</strong>  to make huge contributions make your mark and help everybody I'll help the world out  and because we who knows what you will all discover and but that's only going to come  through being really clear about what we do and do not know and if you know you sort of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:07:57">2:07:57-2:08:13</a>:</strong>  tell them a good story because it makes you sound good but it leads people down the wrong  direction I mean that's just it's as a teacher I just can't imagine doing that is there  anything that that maybe we haven't hit on or that it's kind of short like a one-two-minute<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:13">2:08:13-2:08:32</a>:</strong>  thing of like just a my silly or mycology mind-blower something that is just people  might not know about mycology mushrooms fungi and you know it's just whoa like one of those  types of things if you told somebody one of the mind blowers to me I guess it just one<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:32">2:08:32-2:08:46</a>:</strong>  of the most unusual things is the art and we spoke a lot about them is they are bus  gonna mycorrhizae they're the most unusual it's not really an application thing it's  just sort of like it's so crazy they're so unlike every other organism on the planet<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:08:46">2:08:46-2:09:02</a>:</strong>  that this small group of roughly 300 species is argued and has been strongly argued to  be an entirely unique branch on the tree of life and there's several reasons for that  and the most unusual one is that their spores are are very large visible to the naked eye<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:02">2:09:02-2:09:19</a>:</strong>  unlike most fungal spores which are microscopic and you can't individuate them but these spores  are so large because they host anywhere from 800 to 35,000 genetically distinct nuclei  including the nuclei of other organisms other types of organisms and other types of fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:19">2:09:19-2:09:35</a>:</strong>  and groups of fungi so what does this mean you know whereas most organisms most animals  and things only have one nucleus one set of genetics these ones have upwards of tens of  thousands in my mind they're much like the genetic reserves the the world's on you<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:35">2:09:35-2:09:50</a>:</strong>  know genetic database and library in the soil and when you understand that they're moving  this genetics all around through what they do and they actually have been shown different  species will will fuse together temporarily swap their nuclei between each other and then<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:09:50">2:09:50-2:10:06</a>:</strong>  break back apart which is also not supposed to happen between on species of different  kinds you know two different species aren't supposed to be able to mate in this way that  also makes them unusual and so they're essentially this totally bizarre genetic barter bartering<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:06">2:10:06-2:10:23</a>:</strong>  system below ground and which nucleus out of the hundreds and thousands is taking the  lead at a given moment which genetic reserve are they pulling from to you know help this  tree over there or you know release this compound over there and how much of that is you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:23">2:10:23-2:10:37</a>:</strong>  for lack of better word intelligence or based on some sort of genetic memory or an epigenetic  response whatever framework you want to use to describe the actions of organisms and you  know the the cause and effect of those actions there's something going on here that we don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:37">2:10:37-2:10:53</a>:</strong>  find anywhere else in the natural world and I had to find I only found this this this  fact which is a fact buried so deep in the literature and when I was writing my book  I spent quite a long time reading everything I could find every paper on our bus kind of<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:10:53">2:10:53-2:11:04</a>:</strong>  theorize it because the more I read about them the more I realized how unusual they  were not just important in all these reasons but all these little factoids and if you read  my book I give them a nice big shout out in almost every sentence I have a citation because<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:04">2:11:04-2:11:18</a>:</strong>  almost every sentence is sort of unbelievable how about how weird they are but what this  for is being probably the the weirdest one yeah it's amazing I mean at the end of the  day I mean they're they're more fungi are more like us than like plants and I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:18">2:11:18-2:11:33</a>:</strong>  people think the opposite yeah I mean the I mean we didn't get the evolution thing which  is a huge topic but the you know the it's it's essentially consensus although you're  not going to be you know hearing this in school but if you look at the papers and stuff and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:33">2:11:33-2:11:50</a>:</strong>  I cite it all the thought is that bacteria came first on earth fungi or something like  them came to eat all the dying bacteria eventually plants and animals evolved out of fungi is  the long very long story short and so they're you know they're the first eukaryotes and<br />
<strong><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/insearchofsoil/iSOS-07-PeterMcCoy-FullEpisode.mp3#t=2:11:50">2:11:50-2:12:44</a>:</strong>  the more larger organisms evolved out of their initial structures I mean that that itself  I think is pretty mind-blowing the first time you hear it too.  Thank you.<br />
