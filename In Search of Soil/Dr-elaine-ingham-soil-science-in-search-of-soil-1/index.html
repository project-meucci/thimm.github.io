  <h1>Dr Elaine Ingham Soil Science In Search Of Soil 1</h1>

<h3 id="in-search-of-soil-2020-10-14">In Search of Soil  (2020-10-14)<a class="headerlink" href="#in-search-of-soil-2020-10-14" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h3>
<p><strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:30</a>:</strong>  So, we meet again.  Today's episode of In Search of Soil takes us to the rhizosphere.  The area of soil where plants and roots come together to interact.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:30">0:00:30-0:00:47</a>:</strong>  Where chemical processes and biological processes create magic to make plants grow.  How much of what's actually happening there is magic and how much of it is reality?  We hear a lot of great things when it comes to building soil and a lot of things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:47">0:00:47-0:00:59</a>:</strong>  might be more myth than truth.  Like does crop rotation actually help?  Can you improve soil to make it good enough so weeds don't actually want to grow?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:00:59">0:00:59-0:01:10</a>:</strong>  Are these truths or are these myths?  These are just some of the questions that we're taking on in this episode of In Search  of Soil with Dr. Elaine Ingham.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:10">0:01:10-0:01:27</a>:</strong>  First step is to make sure that we're growing bacteria in the soil.  Dr. Elaine Ingham is a soil microbiologist and a soil pioneer.  She's founder of SoilFoodWeb.com and she's someone who's dedicated a career to looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:27">0:01:27-0:01:43</a>:</strong>  at the soil microbial interactions and promoting them to the public at large.  In this episode Dr. Elaine is going to take on some questions that may question your beliefs  about soil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:43">0:01:43-0:01:55</a>:</strong>  Things like should you not rotate your crops?  Is soil remineralization necessary?  And how important is it to balance out the amount of fungi with bacteria for the type<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:01:55">0:01:55-0:02:06</a>:</strong>  of crop that you want to grow?  To answer these questions and many others let's jump into the conversation with Dr.  Elaine Ingham.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:06">0:02:06-0:02:17</a>:</strong>  This is In Search of Soil.  It's been a few years since we last chatted yet I've followed your work from afar.  I've always admired it and one thing I've been thinking about lately is there anything<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:17">0:02:17-0:02:32</a>:</strong>  new that you've came across in the recent past that's really changed your view on soil  or just blown your mind?  Recently we've been looking into the roles and functions of soil micro and macro arthropods<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:32">0:02:32-0:02:46</a>:</strong>  a little bit more deeply.  We've always just had the attitude that micro arthropods, macro arthropods were predators  and that's really the only benefit they give to the soil food web.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:46">0:02:46-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  But that's not true.  When we started delving a little bit deeper there are probably more like seven very important  functions that micro arthropods do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:11</a>:</strong>  Just like you know people used to think that all nematodes were bad guys.  They were all root feeders.  If you saw a nematode it was like oh no go and get the toxic chemical because you've<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:11">0:03:11-0:03:17</a>:</strong>  got nematodes.  Oh my gosh.  But for fungi they have the same attitude.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:17">0:03:17-0:03:36</a>:</strong>  The only good fungus is a dead fungus and that's absolutely not true either.  So as we have started looking deeper into the roles and functions of soil micro arthropods  they've got protective functions of the roots in the above ground part of the plant.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:36">0:03:36-0:03:53</a>:</strong>  They have their role in nutrient cycling where they are consuming the bacteria and or fungi  more likely the fungi and they're releasing nutrients in the form that the plant needs  to take up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:03:53">0:03:53-0:04:15</a>:</strong>  They also have a role and a function in forming the aggregates within the soil those organo  mineral coated or organic coated mineral particles that are slowly but surely chewing away on  the mineral particle and releasing nutrients.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:15">0:04:15-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  So micro arthropods we've only begun to stick them into all the different roles and functions  that they play in the soil.  It's not just that they eat stuff there's all these other functions and so give us a<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:30">0:04:30-0:04:44</a>:</strong>  year or two to really work on that and we're going to be publishing a whole another chapter  in the story about the soil food web.  For people who aren't familiar what are micro arthropods?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:04:44">0:04:44-0:05:04</a>:</strong>  So micro arthropods are things like springtails or bad mites some of the bad guys like the  red spider mites and you know so there's the good and there's the bad.  How do you manage your agricultural ecosystems so you're selecting for the good guys that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:04">0:05:04-0:05:26</a>:</strong>  will help plants grow versus the bad guys who are messages from mother nature saying  to you bad human being you haven't been keeping your soil healthy these guys these bad guys  are messengers to say better pay attention because if you ignore mother nature what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:26">0:05:26-0:05:39</a>:</strong>  going to happen?  She's just going to send a nastier pest a nastier disease-causing organism so and if  you don't pay attention to that she's going to send something even worse so you better<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:39">0:05:39-0:05:51</a>:</strong>  pay attention at the first message from mother nature this is what that means what is it  I'm doing wrong and what do I need to put back into my soil to reestablish that condition  of health.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:05:51">0:05:51-0:06:07</a>:</strong>  If you're missing some of those micro arthropods in your soil what's the cause of that?  Is that due to some of the same reasons why you might feel heavy weed pressure in a soil  just a bacterial fungal imbalance or the right materials aren't present in the soil?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:07">0:06:07-0:06:23</a>:</strong>  Why are the micro arthropods missing?  Yep same reasons apply and you've got to now figure out which one so you've got that whole  failings of possible problems what does it mean and you've got to figure out what's gone<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:23">0:06:23-0:06:45</a>:</strong>  wrong because then you know what to fix so that's why sending a sample or learning to  do your own microscope work is so critical because we've got a tool that's going to immediately  tell you what's wrong and that leads right to how do I fix this so now you've got to<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:06:45">0:06:45-0:07:07</a>:</strong>  find a compost or you've got to find a tea or an extract or something that will put those  organisms back into the soil so inoculation and then you want to promote the habitat that  allows them to be the winners and still be there over time so now we've got to look at<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:07">0:07:07-0:07:26</a>:</strong>  is your soil aerobic is water in filtering into that soil correctly where's that compaction  zone yep that's what we've got to do we've got to get rid of that or all the many different  things that could be wrong with that soil we want to figure out the cause of the problems<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:26">0:07:26-0:07:44</a>:</strong>  and that's you know the chemical world looks at symptoms and tries to kill the symptom  well that doesn't solve the problem at all we need to figure out what's the cause and  fix that problem if you think about the microscope I think it's an underutilized tool when it<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:07:44">0:07:44-0:08:01</a>:</strong>  comes to farming and gardening and really soil science for the amateur I think people  can get intimidated by it and I don't think they realize the value of it what are your  thoughts on that yeah well when when you figure that kids are who are in kindergarten or first<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:01">0:08:01-0:08:19</a>:</strong>  or second grade learn how to use a microscope within an hour or two time period and you  let them go and let them start looking at any any of the choices within the classroom  go outside grab a bit of soil grab sand whatever you want to look at take a look at it and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:19">0:08:19-0:08:37</a>:</strong>  they can do a perfectly fine job it's you know we're human beings allow themselves to  be intimidated because I think that their training has always been don't touch that  microscope you could hurt it no you'd have to drop a microscope to hurt it so as long<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:37">0:08:37-0:08:58</a>:</strong>  as you're going through the steps and learning there shouldn't be any problem anyone should  be able to use the microscope please don't get intimidated by it come in and work with  us we have people who will help you over their computers so you'll set up your microscope<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:08:58">0:08:58-0:09:19</a>:</strong>  you'll get the camera going on your microscope you hook your camera into your laptop screen  and you share screen with the mentor and then they can tell you exactly what you're doing  no that's not the next step this is the next step and so just write it down you know here<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:19">0:09:19-0:09:34</a>:</strong>  step by step by step and if you ever have any trouble we'll come back and we'll repeat  this session until it becomes second nature yeah I would agree I mean sometimes we're  our own worst enemy and for people that have that intimidation or that fear you offer courses<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:34">0:09:34-0:09:53</a>:</strong>  on learning how to use the microscope when it comes to soil at soilfoodweb.com yes yeah  so we have we have the microscope course so that's the foundation class number four we  have the general overall theory of the soil food web approach so that's foundation class<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:09:53">0:09:53-0:10:16</a>:</strong>  number one making compost foundation class number two making extracts and teas soil the  foundation class number three and then we teach people to to start a lab of their own  where you advertise and you let your the local community know that you can take their soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:16">0:10:16-0:10:34</a>:</strong>  samples and you can tell them how to fix their problems so we're teaching people to run their  own laboratories we've got the consultant training program so you can become a consultant  and go out and help people fix their whole ecosystem based on all your years of looking<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:34">0:10:34-0:10:55</a>:</strong>  through the microscope at soil what are some of the most common issues you see when you  look at soil under the microscope what's missing what are the problems you begin to realize  that you're missing massive parts of that soil food web the only thing that most people<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:10:55">0:10:55-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  see when they look at soil is a boatload of bacteria and if that's all you've got in your  soil that's not soil that's dirt you're not going to grow plants without using toxic chemicals  well and then how much nutrient can that plant actually have in it if it's only getting an<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:35</a>:</strong>  excess of nitrogen and phosphorus and maybe if you're lucky calcium it's missing all the  other nutrients so how can that be healthy for a human being so we've got to get this  whole nutrient cycling system back into the soil and that's what we mostly see is that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:35">0:11:35-0:11:53</a>:</strong>  people are trying to grow plants in dirt not in soil so they can't possibly have healthy  plants for themselves or their animals to eat yeah i think all of us want healthy plants  not just because we only want healthy plants but because we want to be healthier as people<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:11:53">0:11:53-0:12:10</a>:</strong>  and i mean that's been emphasized here with the whole covid 19 pandemic when you think  about bacterial dominated soils in a production setting maybe that's a garden maybe that's  on a home set maybe that's on a farm what could people expect if they fixed that bacterial<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:10">0:12:10-0:12:33</a>:</strong>  imbalance and they shifted the soil to more of a fungal bacterial balance where it was  more even instead of fungal instead of being bacterially dominated my expectation would  be that weeds would go away because as you get the fungi growing those fungi put out<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:33">0:12:33-0:12:55</a>:</strong>  the form of nitrogen for your crop plants not for the weeds so that would be my first  expectation is what you would notice first before anything else maybe secondly that all  of your seeds germinate more rapidly in a healthy environment and then those plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:12:55">0:12:55-0:13:13</a>:</strong>  are getting all the nutrition that they need in the proper balances because it's the plant  putting out the exudates telling the bacteria and fungi what to do and so the bacteria and  fungi go do that because that they're being fed and they're bringing back to that plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:13">0:13:13-0:13:32</a>:</strong>  the nutrients that that plant requires so actually I missed a step the bacteria and  fungi have to be eaten by their predators and that's what releases the plants available  nutrients because the predators have lower concentration of nutrients in their bodies<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:32">0:13:32-0:13:53</a>:</strong>  so they've got to exit the excess so mother nature very cleverly designed this system  to work this way and it works very well until you start killing stuff tillage is a huge  problem you till you are asking for weeds you are asking for a problem with fertility<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:13:53">0:13:53-0:14:12</a>:</strong>  your plants not going to have the nutrition because with tillage you sliced and diced  and crushed all the good guy fungi you wiped out your predators in the system so the good  guy nematodes are now gone and the root feeding nematodes are having a heyday out there it's<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:12">0:14:12-0:14:35</a>:</strong>  like all right all the competition disappeared look at this root chow chow chow and you start  having problems so yeah it's a the things we expect to see is a reduction in the weeds  we expect to see seeds germinating faster we see the plants themselves growing faster<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:35">0:14:35-0:14:59</a>:</strong>  having a more healthy color to them because they're getting that whole group of nutrients  that they require in order to be healthy they start flowering earlier they will set seed  earlier and so that whole cycle goes faster your yields are typically higher it depends<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:14:59">0:14:59-0:15:17</a>:</strong>  on how good a job you've done matching what the requirements of the plant actually are  and how much yield increase that you'll get so people haven't done a real good job of  fixing the problem in the soil they haven't they don't have a microscope they're kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:17">0:15:17-0:15:38</a>:</strong>  of trying to determine whether their plants are happy or not by the way they look so they're  less likely to get all of the benefits up and going in that first growing season so  that they may not see a huge increase in yields if they would get that microscope and they'd<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:15:38">0:15:38-0:16:00</a>:</strong>  be able to monitor what's going on in their soil then they would be able to get those  responses of the organisms up to the levels that they require and much more likely therefore  to have better nutrition in the crop material in the food as well as higher yields in thinking<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:00">0:16:00-0:16:20</a>:</strong>  about this fungal bacterial balance in soils one of the things i always hear a lot of times  right here on youtube in the comments section is forests grow in fungally dominated soils  and herbaceous plants or grasslands grow in bacterially dominated soils i think that statement<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:20">0:16:20-0:16:41</a>:</strong>  is oversimplified and over generalized when you hear that statement what are your thoughts  on it and what does the science say about that statement when somebody says that kind  of sentence it is true but it's minimizing the balancing that has to go on if you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:16:41">0:16:41-0:17:02</a>:</strong>  growing weeds you know so if i can use my hands here if your weeds if your fungi are  down here at the you know almost nobody home and your bacteria are up here at oh my gosh  you know 15 000 micrograms per gram of soil for the bacteria this is set to grow weeds<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:02">0:17:02-0:17:21</a>:</strong>  you've got to bring that bacterial population down by increasing the fungi these two guys  compete with each other the the normal community is going to the bacteria going to come down  as your fungi come up and so now you've got a situation where you might be growing brassica<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:21">0:17:21-0:17:40</a>:</strong>  coal and kale crops require that kind of balance of bacteria and fungi in the soil but if that's  not what you want to be growing you want to get that fungal to bacterial ratio closer  together now you're growing tomatoes potatoes you know all of the solanaceae that we like<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:40">0:17:40-0:17:59</a>:</strong>  so much as we want to grow highly productive grasses you want to get both the bacteria  and fungi at the same biomass within the soil the higher you can get that biomass and notice  my hands are now going up together if we can get that balance we'll get higher yields the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:17:59">0:17:59-0:18:21</a>:</strong>  higher that fungal to bacterial ratio becomes so what's the maximum yield that we can get  in anybody's field well we haven't gotten to that point where we don't get higher yields  and higher yields and higher yields we we've got more research to do what is that highest<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:21">0:18:21-0:18:39</a>:</strong>  point there's got to be a limit but we haven't reached it yet so i can't tell you what that  is but we can double and triple quadruple 10 times 50 times more yield if you can get  that biology going up higher and higher in your soil but what if you want to grow shrubs<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:18:39">0:18:39-0:19:00</a>:</strong>  you want to grow grapevines you want to grow blueberries well then your fungi have to keep  going up because that's a condition that is going to grow much healthier blueberries blackberries  wine grapes whatever kinds of shrubs you you want to be growing if you want a deciduous<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:00">0:19:00-0:19:18</a>:</strong>  forest a healthy deciduous forest that fungal component has to keep going up notice that  the bacteria are not increasing but they're not decreasing either it's just that focal  component is going up so you got to have the bacteria in there and what people mostly don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:18">0:19:18-0:19:38</a>:</strong>  really actually hear is fungal dominated it's not like fungi are the only thing in that  soil there's just more fungi than there are bacteria so they got to listen really hard  when somebody says that sentence when if you want old growth cedar you want you know all<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:19:38">0:19:38-0:20:06</a>:</strong>  those beautiful trees down in california that are huge trunks you know all of those redwood  trees and such that fungal biomass has to be even higher 75 percent of the volume or  weight of a gram of soil should be fungal biomass in a healthy conifer forest certainly<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:06">0:20:06-0:20:25</a>:</strong>  during that winter into the growing season you should see that huge amount of fungal  biomass in the soil well but now predators of the fungi are going to come along and start  eating those fungi releasing the nutrients that were being held that were prevented from<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:25">0:20:25-0:20:48</a>:</strong>  leaching out of that soil held in the fungal biomass the predators come along eat the fungi  now the trees are getting all the nutrition that they need but you might go out in the  middle of the summertime and see that you don't have 75 percent of a cup of soil being<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:20:48">0:20:48-0:21:10</a>:</strong>  fungal biomass but they'll regrow come the late fall when all of that litter material  falling to the surface of the soil is decomposed by the fungi the fungi start growing and completely  tie all that soil together so it doesn't leach it doesn't erode it doesn't wash down the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:10">0:21:10-0:21:32</a>:</strong>  hill it stays in place and so very necessary functions to maintain a healthy conifer forest  in thinking about that in a farming context are you trying to be closer to a one-to-one  fungal to bacterial ratio you want to pay attention to what the crop it is that you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:32">0:21:32-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  want to grow what are the balances that it needs so where is your crop in the successional  system and then you want to mimic you want to get that food web going if i take it as  a given that those ratios can change given the time of year is it important to note when<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:22:10</a>:</strong>  you're taking that measurement and that reading because you're probably going to get a different  reading in summer versus winter and if you try and balance your soils off just one season  you might get yourself out of whack yep so in natural systems you you need to pay attention<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:10">0:22:10-0:22:33</a>:</strong>  to what time of year it is in agricultural systems we're disturbing those systems all  the time and it's almost like we're setting it back to ground zero not where we want to  be for a lot of our more higher level plants to be healthy and happy so we want to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:33">0:22:33-0:22:51</a>:</strong>  that fungal to bacterial biomass ratio at the proper level right from the beginning  right when that seeds put into the ground and starts to grow or when that a perennial  crop that you might have you know shrubs and bushes and things you want to recognize what<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:22:51">0:22:51-0:23:09</a>:</strong>  time of year it is and realize this is the time of year where we've got to have more  fungal biomass in their lower bacteria because we want to have beautiful big blueberries  that taste really sweet and actually have a blueberry flavor to them that's one thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:09">0:23:09-0:23:30</a>:</strong>  i always notice about the blueberries grown with good biology is they actually taste like  blueberries as opposed to something that's grown in chemical plants and it's just mush  you're eating water yeah and it's like this is not tasty so getting the proper biology<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:30">0:23:30-0:23:47</a>:</strong>  really lends so much more flavor to anything that you want to grow if we think about that  fungal to bacterial ratio in the soil and how it relates to specific crops i see how  that information could be valuable do you have or do you know of a chart that's published<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:23:47">0:23:47-0:24:05</a>:</strong>  that has different crops with the different preferred ratios for those crops yeah so on  our website we have been adding that data and i think there's a table on the website  certainly if you take the foundation classes we go through that successional system over<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:05">0:24:05-0:24:26</a>:</strong>  and over and over again and anytime somebody who's taken the foundation courses there's  a information line that they can call into or they can email us that question so you  know if you've taken some of our courses you should be able to answer those questions yourself<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:26">0:24:26-0:24:43</a>:</strong>  but you know if it's like i never heard of elaine talking about you know these kinds  of beans what is that ratio of fungida bacteria that these beans require and so just send  us an email and we'll answer that for you if we think about a lot of agricultural soils<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:24:43">0:24:43-0:25:00</a>:</strong>  being out of balance on the bacterial side for crops like vegetables could we go the  other way and go out of balance on the fungal side when it comes to growing vegetables could  we create a too much fungus problem one popular method of gardening now is the wood chip or<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:00">0:25:00-0:25:14</a>:</strong>  back to eden gardening method a lot of people use it a lot of people say they get great  results and i think they look at their garden and they think it looks great it makes them  feel great the results are anecdotal they're not doing any sort of real analysis there<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:14">0:25:14-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  but by adding all these wood chips on top of the soil could you be creating a problem  by providing too much fungal food and thereby creating a soil that's out of balance towards  the fungal side of things yeah and you can do that because you know think about what<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:49</a>:</strong>  i was just talking about with the successional process if you want to grow bushes shrubs  you want to get that fungal that bacterial to fungal ratio like two times to five times  more fungi than bacteria okay that means this is not really good for growing tomatoes don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:25:49">0:25:49-0:26:11</a>:</strong>  don't try to grow your tomatoes in this because they're they're going to be hurting for certain  kinds of nutrients you really want that um almost equal fungi to bacteria but slightly  on the fungal side to grow tomatoes so if you're constantly putting um wood chips or<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:11">0:26:11-0:26:30</a>:</strong>  other fungal foods into that soil sooner or later you're going to go over the edge into  something where you've got too much fungi so you're not seen as good a grow they're  not your tomatoes aren't as happy your corn isn't as happy your barley your oats things<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:48</a>:</strong>  like that are the hay in your pasture are not doing so well that means you've gone too  far well you know what if it's the other way around you don't have enough yeah you got  to get it into the proper balance for the plant that you're trying to grow and so how<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:26:48">0:26:48-0:27:07</a>:</strong>  well let's stop putting the wood chips into your garden bed right because you've gone  over that edge or what if you realize this and it's like wow but i i really need to have  great tomatoes and i promised everybody the most delicious tomatoes they've ever had what<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:07">0:27:07-0:27:32</a>:</strong>  do you do to switch this around the simplest thing to do is to go get some blackstrap non-sulfured  molasses because that is bacteria food par excellence you want to get those bacteria  revved up you get them going you just put a very small amount of molasses into the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:32">0:27:32-0:27:50</a>:</strong>  and you'll see your bacteria starting to bounce up so if you were here you're going to be  here pretty rapidly don't overdo it get too many bacteria and now you're growing weeds  so you've got to be careful as you're doing some of these things and that's where the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:27:50">0:27:50-0:28:10</a>:</strong>  microscope becomes so easy to give you the answers that you need you take a sample of  that soil put it on the microscope and now you look at the balance of the bacterial and  the fungal biomass and you know that you should not be putting on any more molasses or you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:10">0:28:10-0:28:27</a>:</strong>  haven't quite put enough next year don't put the wood chips in at the high concentrations  that you have been putting the wood chips in that totally makes a lot of sense and i  think it is a case of too much is not necessarily too much of a good thing it's maybe this is<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:27">0:28:27-0:28:41</a>:</strong>  a guy thing but it's like when you go to do laundry and you pour the laundry detergent  into the little cup and the lines right at the bottom and you kind of look at that and  say that's not enough and you just pour more in and suddenly you have a brady bunch overflowing<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:41">0:28:41-0:28:57</a>:</strong>  washing machine moment and it is important to limit what you're putting in but it's also  i'm realizing important to know what what you're putting into the soil what it's actually  doing when it gets to the soil and you can't see that with your eyes you can't look at<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:28:57">0:28:57-0:29:12</a>:</strong>  the soil and tell you look at the plants or maybe analyze the plants and have some idea  of what's going on in the soil but you can't see into the soil and i'm realizing the importance  of a microscope here and how that can actually help you see what's happening in the soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:12">0:29:12-0:29:31</a>:</strong>  so you can get some idea of what you're working with what you're starting with so you can  adjust from there and you're not just pouring stuff onto the soil or layering stuff onto  the soil flying blind not really knowing if you're adding what you need or not yeah exactly<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:31">0:29:31-0:29:51</a>:</strong>  so it's a really useful tool to help you manage correctly and you know as the the saying is  goes you know if you can't measure you can't manage so where's your measurement tool it's  very simple to learn to use that microscope identify these organisms and know whether<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:29:51">0:29:51-0:30:07</a>:</strong>  you should be putting on more molasses or whether you should be putting on humic acid  and whether you're adding molasses or humic acid or even compost to the soil those are  ways that humans try to build soil we add stuff to the top or we pour stuff on or we<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:07">0:30:07-0:30:24</a>:</strong>  try and turn stuff into the soil but another way soil can be built is just by nature doing  it plants putting plants in the ground and letting plants help encourage microbial life  underneath the soil by getting that carbon pump going collecting the sun rays turning<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:24">0:30:24-0:30:43</a>:</strong>  it into sugar and then injecting that sugar into the soil to feed microbial life when  you think about plants building soil are there fungal favorite plants like i'm thinking cover  crops that you could plant that would encourage fungi to grow either while the crops are living<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:30:43">0:30:43-0:31:02</a>:</strong>  or that the fungi could feed off when the cover crops are terminated what are your thoughts  on that are there crops that are more fungal lee than bacterially favored yeah if if you  want to use and see we always recommend cover plants that are perennial because they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:02">0:31:02-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  and you want the really short low growing ones they put their roots down deep into the  soil typically their perennial plants are going to get those down they're fairly they're  somewhat woody typically and so short low going things so they're not going to interfere<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:37</a>:</strong>  with whatever crop you're trying to grow but you don't have to mow these down you don't  have to crimp them you don't have to do anything year after year after year for the next two  thousand years we could have the same cover plants growing and never have to do anything<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:37">0:31:37-0:31:56</a>:</strong>  to add more mulch or add more compost or all the other things that are so laborious when  we're trying to maintain a garden or an acre of your farm or something so that could be  so that's enough because they're gonna you know you harvest the above ground part of<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:31:56">0:31:56-0:32:19</a>:</strong>  your plants you let the residues fall to the surface of the soil and because these cover  plants are maintaining that biology in the soil it doesn't matter that your crop above  ground got all dried out you know really hot dry conditions which is what we want to you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:19">0:32:19-0:32:41</a>:</strong>  know before we harvest any seeds but if your soil surface dried and got all hardened out  all of your biology has either gone down into the soil or a lot of that biology has died  which means now you're going to have to do something to bring back that biology that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:41">0:32:41-0:32:59</a>:</strong>  shouldn't have died it should have been covered by something but the easy way to do it is  to seed in that perennial crop once and then it's there forever and it's going to protect  your soil surface from drying out it's going to protect your soil surface from one of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:32:59">0:32:59-0:33:19</a>:</strong>  most compacting factors ever invented which is rainfall falling from the sky and smacking  on your soil that's a compacting event oftentimes you will see the compaction layer forming  at the surface but if it's not forming here it's forming down here usually at about four<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:19">0:33:19-0:33:41</a>:</strong>  to six inches and there's a compaction layer in your soil that won't let your roots grow  down as deep into that soil as you want them to grow and then those cover plants will maintain  the biology in your soil after you've harvested your crop plant so you're still making sure<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:33:41">0:33:41-0:34:02</a>:</strong>  you're keeping the balance where it needs to be for whatever plant you're trying to  grow make sure you're matching your cover plant to what you want to grow here it means  that you don't rotate your crops you may rotate within the same successional stage but you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:02">0:34:02-0:34:21</a>:</strong>  wouldn't want to grow brassicas here one year and then corn here the next year the brassica  wipe out all the mycorrhizal fungi that the corn has to have in order to be able to yield  well you put to all this mycorrhizal spores back into the soil to in order to grow your<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:21">0:34:21-0:34:42</a>:</strong>  crop is here and now the next year you put the brassica on there you are not going to  be growing brassica if you've got a massive amount of mycorrhizal colonization in that  system so you stop rotating kind of mindlessly you rotate and you stay within the same successional<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:34:42">0:34:42-0:35:01</a>:</strong>  stages not mixing these things that need mostly bacteria versus things that need mostly fungi  and so the exudates coming out of the root system of that perennial plant maintain the  biology where you want it to be so you could keep growing corn in the same place year after<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:01">0:35:01-0:35:26</a>:</strong>  year after year after year after year so um here we go with the organic regs organic says  the organic management system says you have to rotate crops because they have the mistaken  understanding that if you plant the same plant for very long it's somehow going to remove<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:26">0:35:26-0:35:48</a>:</strong>  too much of one or two nutrients that's not how soil works you keep planting something  in the same place you'll get some dominant organisms kind of taken over but if you have  the cover plant in there now you've got yep the main crop but why not make certain that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:35:48">0:35:48-0:36:08</a>:</strong>  you've got five or six different species of plants growing as that short low growing cover  plant or ground cover it's another term that people use for these kinds of plants and so  now you have a mix you're going to maintain all the different species of bacteria and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:08">0:36:08-0:36:25</a>:</strong>  fungi and protozoa nematodes and micro arthropods and earthworms and everything else that should  be in that soil so you don't lose diversity now people always say you're going to if you  plant the same thing in the same place year after year you're going to develop a massive<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:25">0:36:25-0:36:42</a>:</strong>  number of disease causing problems you're going to have pests like you wouldn't believe  they just get worse every year you can't mean keep growing the same thing in the same place  but you're preventing the diseases and the pest problems from developing by having this<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:36:42">0:36:42-0:37:00</a>:</strong>  diversity nutrient cycling is always going to go on your plants always going to have  all the nutrients that it needs every second of every day it will never be stressed and  the diseases and pests never come into that part of your garden so we've got to do a little<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:00">0:37:00-0:37:18</a>:</strong>  bit of readjustment of people's thoughts about having to rotate plants if you maintain good  biology in your soil you don't ever have to rotate your plants keep growing the same thing  in the same place for as long as you want to the whole idea of not rotating crops and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:18">0:37:18-0:37:33</a>:</strong>  growing the same crop year after year in the same location it's interesting and it parallels  i guess the natural analogy would be a grassland one that's not successional but one that lives  for thousands and thousands of years where you more or less have the same species of<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:33">0:37:33-0:37:51</a>:</strong>  grass growing in that same space and you're getting all that nutrient cycling through  herbivores and fires and that type of thing that have a robust diverse microbial community  below ground that enable this huge grass biomass to grow above ground that's never really changing<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:37:51">0:37:51-0:38:11</a>:</strong>  there is no crop rotation in a grassland it's healthy and when it isn't the system fixes  itself so is that what we're mimicking here yep i like all the like the blueberry meadows  that people have and um here in oregon up in the mountains as far as we know and going<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:11">0:38:11-0:38:30</a>:</strong>  back into indian lore this has been a blueberry patch for the last thousand years and yet  it's some of the best blueberries you'll ever taste in your whole life and they're not sick  they're not unhealthy they're not attracting disease how can that be what it means is our<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:30">0:38:30-0:38:52</a>:</strong>  understanding of agriculture is flawed as human beings when we start paying attention  to how nature manages things and we start changing our agriculture to work the way nature  works because nature has only been managing to do this process for the last three and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:38:52">0:38:52-0:39:14</a>:</strong>  a half to four billion years i think she's had a little bit of time to figure it all  out why do we human beings have to be so arrogant that we think we know better than nature so  pay attention to what nature does and probably the the most important tool that you need<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:14">0:39:14-0:39:31</a>:</strong>  is a microscope so you'll be able to see what nature is actually doing and then mimic her  thinking about this perennial ground cover in a vegetable type system what types of plants  come to mind i've thought a lot about this you need something low-lying you probably<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:31">0:39:31-0:39:50</a>:</strong>  want it to provide several functions maybe it fixes nitrogen or it's a pollinator or  something like that what are crops that you've heard of or that you can think of that come  to mind when you think about a perennial ground cover in a vegetable-based system um we have<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:39:50">0:39:50-0:40:08</a>:</strong>  a whole list of those different plants on the website just because i can't remember  them all um you know i go out in my backyard and i've got like 10 different kinds of cover  plants for where i'm growing tomatoes and potatoes or um celery or lettuce um really<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:08">0:40:08-0:40:28</a>:</strong>  good match for those kinds of plants if you really want to grow at um the brassica and  most a lot of people do brassica coal kale crops you want to be pushing actinobacteria  in that soil so in your compost you want to always develop that actinobacteria community<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:28">0:40:28-0:40:51</a>:</strong>  that's what prevents the mycorrhizal fungi from attacking those root systems of the brassicas  so um if you want to have perennial understory plants you want to go towards the creeping  thyme the um creeping lavender that's there's a whole slew of of short low growing things<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:40:51">0:40:51-0:41:12</a>:</strong>  that have very woody stems and that's usually a good giveaway so go to your seed catalogs  and start paying attention to how tall do these plants actually grow and dutch white  clover works really great when we're dealing with the um tomatoes potatoes um celery those<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:12">0:41:12-0:41:35</a>:</strong>  sorts of things um but the other clovers have driven me crazy um you know i bought the mini  clover that wasn't supposed to grow more than two inches well in my garden under my conditions  those clovers grow to a foot and a half right so if you've got a good healthy soil look<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:35">0:41:35-0:41:56</a>:</strong>  out for the claims about yes this is a mini clover it only grows this tall um we tried  micro clover we've tried all the different kinds of clovers they're fine under big tall  trees and shrubs but you grow anything that's going to be shorter no it's not a good match<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:41:56">0:41:56-0:42:17</a>:</strong>  i i remember where we grew um a row of beets and we had a clover as the understory plant  so we dug out a big space around each one of those beet plants that we put in so it  must have been you know eight inches across and we figured okay we've got the clover beet<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:17">0:42:17-0:42:38</a>:</strong>  back it shouldn't there should be no problem we'll be back on monday to see how things  are going so we left and we could see every single clover we got back on monday we couldn't  find the beets swallowed the be swallowed up just covered by a layer of clover and so<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:38">0:42:38-0:42:56</a>:</strong>  now you have to dig in there and try not to rip up the beets while you're trying to rip  out the clover and just not worth the time and effort uh that condra is another really  good one for most vegetable crops uh dichondra typically doesn't get much taller than a couple<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:42:56">0:42:56-0:43:14</a>:</strong>  of inches and the root systems go nice and deep down into the soil um pretty aggressive  they don't usually allow anything to grow and take over them you know grasses are about  the only thing that yeah on occasion you're have to gonna kind of come in and want to<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:14">0:43:14-0:43:33</a>:</strong>  pull out a couple of the grass plants that are starting to grow real tall but otherwise  dichondra works really well so this is kind of headline material i think it's an eye catcher  it's click baity and it's a mind blower for some people but do you think that if you got<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:33">0:43:33-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  your soil in balance microbially biologically that you could dramatically decrease weed  pressure and potentially never or rarely see weeds in that soil again unless the soil was  damaged it would be a very rare thing and then those weeds would be the things that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:16</a>:</strong>  would be sick and unhappy and unhealthy and they often won't flower they often aren't  going to go through a reproductive stage if you do see them reproducing it's certainly  easy enough to pull off the flowers um so on rare occasions we'll we'll find there was<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:16">0:44:16-0:44:34</a>:</strong>  a bear patch or something a mouse came in and had to dig up something it buried something  a squirrel came and buried an acorn or oh okay so we get the occasional weeds but it's  certainly not like something that you're going to have to come in and deal with or walk down<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:34">0:44:34-0:44:51</a>:</strong>  the road with your weed eater and just cut off the tops of the weeds that are growing  above your cover crop i love the idea of the perennial ground cover and if you had to choose  between keeping a perennial ground cover in place and adding compost to supplement the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:44:51">0:44:51-0:45:09</a>:</strong>  soil from the top which one would you choose obviously the perennial ground cover has some  advantages like it's less work you plant it once and it keeps working forever underneath  the ground but there's also some types of plants and commercial crops that a perennial<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:09">0:45:09-0:45:30</a>:</strong>  ground cover would be cumbersome with so could you mimic the perennial ground cover with  something like compost teas if you couldn't have a perennial ground cover at the same  time as a cash crop just given how these crops grow yeah and it's got to be a decision on<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:30">0:45:30-0:45:48</a>:</strong>  the part of the person who owns the garden who owns that soil that land which one do  you feel more comfortable doing and i of course being a lazy gardener i want to do as little  work as possible i'd much rather go swimming for the whole entire summer than be you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:45:48">0:45:48-0:46:06</a>:</strong>  pulling weeds out so i'm always going to pick the permanent cover so that there's not a  lot of work there for me to do but if that's not somebody's choice that you know they oh  it's too difficult trying to figure out all the combinations well then putting down the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:06">0:46:06-0:46:22</a>:</strong>  compost is a mulch that's a really good way to suppress all of those weeds just make sure  it's a thick enough layer and then you've got to monitor it because a lot of times the  weather conditions are such that that thick nice thick layer of mulch is going to almost<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:22">0:46:22-0:46:42</a>:</strong>  disappear within you know two or three weeks and it's gone and you've lost your disease  suppressive layer so you know get back out there and put the mulch on again put out the  compost teas the compost extracts teas typically go on the foliage where you might certainly<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:46:42">0:46:42-0:47:04</a>:</strong>  if in the past you've had a problem with a disease or a pest of some kind protect the  above ground part of your plant um so that there's no surface that that disease or pest  organism can attack um so they'll go someplace else they won't even recognize that your um<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:04">0:47:04-0:47:27</a>:</strong>  favorite crop is down there they're going to go elsewhere because those insects home  in on the compounds that are released by sick and an unhealthy plant insects are looking  for something that's not doing well and so I've always thought of those insects as being<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:27">0:47:27-0:47:43</a>:</strong>  or those disease-causing fungi as being messages from mother nature about there's something  wrong with the plant there's something wrong with the soil it's not getting the nutrition  it's not getting the protective compounds so pay attention and if you don't pay attention<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:43">0:47:43-0:47:58</a>:</strong>  mother nature is going to take a bigger amount of your plants next year and the year after  it's going to be the whole acre and the year after that well you can grow something else  for the next period of time because you're not paying attention to what nature is trying<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:47:58">0:47:58-0:48:10</a>:</strong>  to tell you.  Let's say you are in a crop rotation where you have a bed out of production for some  period of time you grow a cover crop in it and then you just rotate around between cover<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:10">0:48:10-0:48:21</a>:</strong>  crops and cash crops.  In the cover crop beds how would you deal with that cover crop?  Do you think there's a preference here between when you go to terminate the cover crop you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:21">0:48:21-0:48:38</a>:</strong>  could either one just mow it down or chop and drop it leave it in place to just decompose  on soil surface or option two would be when you want to terminate that cover crop you  can just cut it off at ground level leave the roots in the ground take the tops compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:38">0:48:38-0:48:57</a>:</strong>  them somewhere else and then reintroduce that compost back onto that plot.  Yeah I'm always going to walk around both of those.  I'm going to take the third option which is to not even have that cover crop step in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:48:57">0:48:57-0:49:19</a>:</strong>  rotation there is no need to do that if you're constantly growing this permanent perennial  understory set of plants because they're putting back into the soil all of those organic matter  that your plants are going to need they're developing and building structure in that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:19">0:49:19-0:49:37</a>:</strong>  soil so oxygen moves into the soil and goes as deep as it possibly can water infiltrates  such that half of all of those pores are filled with water the other half is filled with air  and you couldn't ask for a better soil if you can get that done.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:49:37">0:49:37-0:50:03</a>:</strong>  So I just don't even want to think about leaving a quarter of my land or half of my land in  a non without something growing in it that I can make money from as long as you're maintaining  soil you don't have to do that you don't have to worry about crimping and mowing or plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:03">0:50:03-0:50:22</a>:</strong>  buying the seed every year you have to go out and buy those annual plants you put them  in you get them to grow and then you chop them down doesn't that just seem kind of nonsensical?  I'm with you it's a lot of work and there's a lot of challenges that go with cover crops<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:22">0:50:22-0:50:36</a>:</strong>  yet I think people see seeds and they hear people talk about cover crops and they think  that they have to do them or they should do them without fully thinking through why they're  doing what they're doing when you do have an alternative like a perennial cover crop<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:36">0:50:36-0:50:52</a>:</strong>  and I love the idea of a perennial cover crop or probably better said a perennial ground  cover but I think there's challenges with a perennial ground cover it's something that's  kind of new when it comes to production systems it can potentially create problems with some<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:50:52">0:50:52-0:51:12</a>:</strong>  crops like low-lying crops lettuces and things like that you're not gonna be able to use  a perennial ground cover with those do you know of any examples of production farms that  have perennial ground covers in place alongside production cash crops like vegetables?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:12">0:51:12-0:51:33</a>:</strong>  On small scale yeah so quite you know quite a few people in California up in Massachusetts  Iowa yeah various places but it it hasn't really taken off yet because I think most  people are going I'll switch because it certainly sounds easier but I want somebody else to<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:33">0:51:33-0:51:53</a>:</strong>  start to do it first and so we've got to get the innovators really clued into all of this  and so like we're buying a farm for soil food web school working with other farms in various  places around the world that we are going to start doing this approach so come to the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:51:53">0:51:53-0:52:20</a>:</strong>  demos of where we're working you know we've got people in Holland and Switzerland and  Germany and Portugal Sweden so well well represented in Europe we're working with people in Brazil  in Ecuador and Costa Rica lots of different places so hopefully soon to be doing things<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:20">0:52:20-0:52:41</a>:</strong>  in Southeast Asia as well so it's come to the demo farms yeah come to the demo farms  and and see what plants work for the different kinds of plants that were growing what the  crops are that were growing you can get a good idea and maybe even the mixture and that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:41">0:52:41-0:52:59</a>:</strong>  another business we plan on establishing is we'll get the mixes going in our property  we'll harvest the seeds and then we'll sell local people will sell the seeds to I really  love the idea of these perennial ground covers because it just decreases work no tilling<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:52:59">0:52:59-0:53:20</a>:</strong>  less weeding you're always feeding the soil less composting you're really only composting  as needed with crop waste crop residue but by removing some of this composting from the  system and by having perennial ground cover always in the system and by selling a cash<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:20">0:53:20-0:53:40</a>:</strong>  crop how do you deal with nutrient replacement if you're selling a cash crop by default you're  exporting nutrients from your property because when the vegetables leave they take nutrients  that came out of the soil with them how do you get those nutrients back in the soil in<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:53:40">0:53:40-0:54:00</a>:</strong>  a perennial ground cover type situation where you're not adding a lot of compost to the  surface another way of asking that is what are your thoughts on soil remineralization  and is it necessary because your soil is replenishing itself with all those nutrients by the fact<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:00">0:54:00-0:54:22</a>:</strong>  that the bacterium fungi use their acids they use their enzymes to break down pebbles and  rocks and larger chunks and boulders and the bedrock is all being broken down and that  means more sand silt clay particles are being replenished so you know you might be chewing<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:22">0:54:22-0:54:42</a>:</strong>  up some of the sand silt and clay and pulling all the nutrients out of them but down here  in the lower part of the soil you know whatever how whatever depth your soil is every second  of every day more sand silt and clay are being made and so till the day that you've chewed<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:54:42">0:54:42-0:55:02</a>:</strong>  up all that sand silt and clay all of the organic matter because remember the organic  matter has all those nutrients in it too already in the right balances so what's wrong with  growing plants in pure organic matter it's gonna it's got all the nutrients you just<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:02">0:55:02-0:55:19</a>:</strong>  have the biology you have to have that biology in order to pull those nutrients out of that  matrix that they're in pull it inside their bodies and then they've got to get eaten by  the protozoa the nematodes the micro arthropods the earthworms all of those good kids and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:19">0:55:19-0:55:38</a>:</strong>  that's what releases those nutrients in plant available forms right next to the root the  root doesn't have to do any work it just can take up very simple right from the local surrounding  it doesn't have to try to transport that nitrogen from two feet away how long is it going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:38">0:55:38-0:55:56</a>:</strong>  take that nitrogen to get to the root system if it's two feet away well you've got a dead  plant before it ever gets there so all of those nutrients are in the sand the silt the  clays the rocks the pebbles and so when you think about that silica bilayer that all of<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:55:56">0:55:56-0:56:15</a>:</strong>  these mineral components of the soil are built and in between that silica bilayer are all  the nutrients have already been pulled inside those structures all you've got to have are  the bacterium fungi with their enzymes come along and pull out the specific nutrients<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:15">0:56:15-0:56:35</a>:</strong>  that the plants asking for look i want boron i'll give you this food if you go out and  bring me back the boron and then you know over here it's saying i need more zinc i need  more iron the plant is telling that biology exactly what the plant needs and exactly what<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:35">0:56:35-0:56:53</a>:</strong>  the bacterium fungi should be beating them back for the plant what about replenishing  nitrogen in the system that's a big nutrient i think a lot of people freak out about where's  the nitrogen coming from it's especially for nitrogen we have a couple of alternative forms<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:56:53">0:56:53-0:57:15</a>:</strong>  of obtaining nitrogen straight from the atmosphere in terms of nitrogen fixation so if you have  any of the legumes if you've got any free living nitrogen fixers you those organisms  can fix nitrogen and that's one of the things about soil scientists and the way they explain<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:15">0:57:15-0:57:38</a>:</strong>  the nitrogen cycle they forget to tell you about any of the biology any of the organisms  that have to be there it is the organisms that do all the transformations of the nitrogen  from n2 gas into amino acids that's the next step in the nitrogen cycle it you know you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:57:38">0:57:38-0:58:01</a>:</strong>  always read these papers that say nitrate was produced and released into the soil by  these nitrogen fixing microorganisms no that is not true that is not how it works they  forget a whole bunch of the biological steps that have to occur to convert from n2 into<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:01">0:58:01-0:58:27</a>:</strong>  nh4 or no3 so i go through that whole nitrogen cycle and how it actually works and show people  what organisms are required for each step along the way and you know it is one more  form one more way to get that nitrogen into the soil in the proper form what's the balance<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:27">0:58:27-0:58:53</a>:</strong>  nh4 no3 it is the microorganisms that determine what kind of plant you're going to be growing  and so most of the time you don't have to have nitrogen fixing microorganisms to do  that job legumes and free living nitrogen fixers you know the rhizobium and free living<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:58:53">0:58:53-0:59:18</a>:</strong>  nitrogen fixers are a small part of that pool if you've got normal bacterium fungi doing  what the plant tells them there is a massive amount of nitrogen present in the mineral  forms of the soil in the sand, clay, rocks and pebbles etc your plant can live on that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:18">0:59:18-0:59:42</a>:</strong>  nitrogen you don't have to add the nitrogen fixation well you know but why not make one  of your understory plants a legume of some kind grow some oh well any one of those nitrogen  fixing plants grow them in that mix and you're just adding nitrogen icing on top of the cake.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=0:59:42">0:59:42-1:00:01</a>:</strong>  Shifting away from the perennial ground covers let's touch on compost one thing I see out  there is a lot of compost usage probably more in the category of overusing compost applying  deep thick layers four or six inches at a time sometimes several times a year what are<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:01">1:00:01-1:00:20</a>:</strong>  your thoughts on using too much compost is there a point on the curve where the curve  flattens out and you reach the law of diminishing returns where more isn't better and you could  get the same results with less and you could actually get worse results by adding more?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:20">1:00:20-1:00:38</a>:</strong>  Most of the time I get my best production in pure compost so you know if you're adding  two or three or five or six or two feet worth of compost into your beds is it going to be  a real problem?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:00:38">1:00:38-1:01:01</a>:</strong>  Well the problem comes because they don't have the biology in that compost it is the  microorganisms that form the structure which allow oxygen and water to move into that material  and move all the way through if you have a massive downpour if you have a really wet<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:01">1:01:01-1:01:24</a>:</strong>  springtime and it doesn't stop raining that whole pile of organic matter no matter how  little it or big it is it's going to get totally water locked and that's the danger as soon  as you reduce oxygen concentration in that compost or in the soil that's got a decent<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:24">1:01:24-1:01:42</a>:</strong>  amount of organic matter in it those organisms are growing utilizing that organic matter  but oxygen is not able to infiltrate through something that's water locked and so now you  go anaerobic all those beneficial organisms are going to go to sleep they're going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:01:42">1:01:42-1:02:04</a>:</strong>  form dormant stages because they can't tolerate their enzymes won't work if there's too little  oxygen present if it's water locked oxygen cannot move through water very rapidly as  all at all which is why you and I cannot live in the water not enough diffusion for us so<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:04">1:02:04-1:02:19</a>:</strong>  these organisms are going to go to sleep if they catch on that things are going south  that it's getting anaerobic they're going to produce dormant stages which means whenever  it does get aerobic again they'll be able to germinate and start to grow so they're<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:19">1:02:19-1:02:42</a>:</strong>  just going to hang out until the conditions get better but as soon as those anaerobic  organisms say well ho oxygen's disappearing I can germinate I can grow and now my enzymes  will work because my enzymes are destroyed by oxygen and so now you start getting your<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:02:42">1:02:42-1:03:03</a>:</strong>  nitrogen converted into ammonia and of course anybody who knows about ammonia trying to  grow a plant it kills ammonia will directly kill your root system it will kill your above  ground part of your plant so if your soil if your compost is going anaerobic you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:03">1:03:03-1:03:23</a>:</strong>  going to take all that wonderful nitrogen that's present in that compost or in that  soil and start converting it to ammonia gas well you can smell that when that's happening  your soil is going to be left with a really dark black color to it under anaerobic conditions<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:23">1:03:23-1:03:49</a>:</strong>  the anaerobic microorganisms are going to use their enzymes to convert the sulfur that's  in your soil the SO4, SO3, S2O3, S2O4 whatever form of sulfur you've got in your soil and  they're going to convert that into hydrogen sulfide H2S that will kill your plants it<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:03:49">1:03:49-1:04:11</a>:</strong>  leaves behind a dark color in your soil and of course you can smell that sulfur compound  as it comes off of your soil it's you know the smell of sulfur smell wonderful rotten  egg that's what the word I was trying to think of rotten egg smell is what's going to be<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:11">1:04:11-1:04:29</a>:</strong>  left so you're going to be losing all your nitrogen you're going to be losing all your  sulfur and finally you're going to lose all your phosphorus right PO4 is going to be converted  into phosphine gas and you wave goodbye to all your nutrients and your plants going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:29">1:04:29-1:04:55</a>:</strong>  be killed by the alcohol that's being produced or by the really low pH organic acids that  are being produced people often say you know you you a pH of 4.5 is perfectly okay you  want to grow blueberries in a soil of pH 4.5 no because the only way to reach a pH of 4.5<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:04:55">1:04:55-1:05:17</a>:</strong>  in soil is for it to go anaerobic and that's going to all of these things contribute to  the death of your plant exactly what killed your plant any one of these things so as soon  as that goes waterlogged you're in trouble as soon as oxygen can't move into that soil<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:17">1:05:17-1:05:33</a>:</strong>  so comes in the springtime that's often a problem that you you put on a lot of organic  matter the organisms are growing really fast in there so it goes anaerobic really rapidly  and you're going to lose your starts you're going to lose the plants that are in that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:33">1:05:33-1:05:55</a>:</strong>  material so don't make the mistake of blaming the compost for something that water logging  was actually the culprit could you go the other way and use a lot less compost instead  of using a lot of compost you're using less but you're using really high quality compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:05:55">1:05:55-1:06:17</a>:</strong>  if the goal of good compost isn't just bulk organic matter but instead it's to inoculate  the soil with good microbes then is it better to go with less high quality compost than  more or a large volume of low quality compost yeah quality is going to give you a lot better<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:17">1:06:17-1:06:40</a>:</strong>  result you want a massive diversity of these microorganisms in in the compost or in the  tea or the extract made from that compost you want that massive diversity we don't know  all the different conditions that are in your soil and we know that each species of bacteria<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:06:40">1:06:40-1:07:00</a>:</strong>  fungi protozoa nematodes micro arthropods etc are very tuned to just a very limited  set of conditions and they're only going to grow under this limited set of conditions  as soon as the temperature moisture nutrient content whatever changes a lot of those individual<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:00">1:07:00-1:07:15</a>:</strong>  species are going to go to sleep but then a whole bunch of them that were there waiting  for the right conditions they're going to wake up and they're going to start doing their  jobs so we want to make sure we have this massive diversity so no matter what these<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:15">1:07:15-1:07:32</a>:</strong>  changing conditions are doing there's always going to be some you know a couple thousand  species of these organisms always functioning no matter what the conditions are conditions  change these guys go to sleep but these guys wake up conditions change they go to sleep<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:32">1:07:32-1:07:51</a>:</strong>  these guys wake up so we're maintaining the biomass of these organisms in the soil at  consistent levels we do want to know that we've got massive diversity and again how  do you know that well it's called your microscope take a look at them you want to be seen lots<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:07:51">1:07:51-1:08:08</a>:</strong>  of different sizes and shapes of bacteria some of them should be motile some of them  will just be sitting there kind of bobbling in the water but you see that you've got a  massive diversity of different sizes and shapes now some of them like to chain up some of<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:08">1:08:08-1:08:25</a>:</strong>  them like to make little picket fences all of that diversity you want to see in your  soil with your fungi same thing with the protozoa same thing with the nematodes same thing you  want to see that diversity and so if we're putting in high quality compost as an inoculum<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:25">1:08:25-1:08:45</a>:</strong>  we're adding all that massive diversity how do you know that all this biology is going  to be able to take care of all the conditions that will change through the whole entire  growing season we've got to make sure that we've got those organisms in there if mother<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:08:45">1:08:45-1:09:02</a>:</strong>  nature decides to make this a hot dry summer we need those organisms that are going to  live under those conditions and do their job for your plant what if it's going to be a  cold wet summer well then you need all those organisms in your compost too just to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:02">1:09:02-1:09:19</a>:</strong>  sure that you've you're going to have all of the organisms all of the functions of those  organisms are going to occur no matter what the conditions well what if you have think  of all the combinations that you have in your soil and you want to make certain that all<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:19">1:09:19-1:09:40</a>:</strong>  of these organisms are present that can do the work under whatever conditions we need  something around 75,000 species of bacteria that's not individuals that's species of bacteria  so that you always know that somebody's going to be in there taking care of the job doing<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:40">1:09:40-1:09:59</a>:</strong>  the job for you you want to have about 25,000 different species of fungi and all the good  guys not the bad guys I'm not talking bad guys here I'm talking good guys they all have  to have aerobic conditions in order to do their jobs they all have to have food they<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:09:59">1:09:59-1:10:15</a>:</strong>  all will wake up and go to sleep as required through the course of summer based on the  conditions that nature is sending us that's where you can know that your soil is really  going to be healthy if you don't have that diversity there could be you know two to three<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:15">1:10:15-1:10:32</a>:</strong>  months where your plant has no support personnel taking care of it.  So when I think about high quality compost I think about it as an inoculant I think you  want a lot of diversity of microorganisms and a lot of those microorganisms one thing<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:32">1:10:32-1:10:50</a>:</strong>  you have me thinking of though is seasonality and how seasons change and how micro populations  change throughout the seasons if you were making compost over a certain period of time  a short period of time during the year is there a chance that you would only have microbes<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:10:50">1:10:50-1:11:08</a>:</strong>  that are active during that time of the year so when you add them to your soil you're missing  out on organisms that would otherwise enter a pile if a pile sat there year round if a  soil is going to need organisms in the ground year round don't you want to be adding organisms<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:08">1:11:08-1:11:24</a>:</strong>  in your compost that were there throughout the year?  Well actually mother nature is sneakier than that because where does the original inoculum  of organisms that are going to be in your compost pile where do they come from?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:24">1:11:24-1:11:44</a>:</strong>  They come from the organic matter that you're putting into the pile and so you don't want  to be making a compost pile out of you know 50 percent straw and 50 percent manure and  I've gone to composting operations where they say that's the best way to make compost and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:44">1:11:44-1:11:57</a>:</strong>  I just shudder to think about the lack of diversity in that straw and manure how many  good guys are in manure?  Well not many how about on straw?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:11:57">1:11:57-1:12:15</a>:</strong>  Well okay you're going to get some but nowhere near the diversity that you're going to need  so now how would you improve the diversity instead of you know 50 percent straw 50 percent  manure and I would probably recommend only 20 percent manure and I would want to make<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:15">1:12:15-1:12:33</a>:</strong>  it a couple of different kinds of manure let's not just get stuck with now stinky smelly  sloppy manure you know could we understand that signal when we're dealing with a animal  that's got diarrhea is that a healthy animal?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:33">1:12:33-1:12:50</a>:</strong>  No you don't have the good guy organisms in here you're going to have to do a lot to kill  the bad guys that are coming to you in that form so I want some chicken manure I want  some goat manure I'd like maybe some llama manure in there as well and then other plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:12:50">1:12:50-1:13:11</a>:</strong>  materials so you don't even have to use manure if you don't want to but if you do you're  adding an improved diversity let's get some alfalfa let's get some you know spent grains  from brewing beer let's a huge diversity but that's only going to be 10 to 20 percent of<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:11">1:13:11-1:13:27</a>:</strong>  my pile now I'm going to go get some green stuff so straight out of your garden all where  you've harvested all your peas take that green plant material that's going to grow bacteria  really well well how about cutting some of your grass okay so now I've got lawn clippings<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:27">1:13:27-1:13:46</a>:</strong>  well maybe we really want to go out to that hayfield because there's a lot of different  kinds of plant materials there's not just grass but there's forbs and herbs in there  as well so as much diversity well all your kitchen scraps should go into your compost<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:13:46">1:13:46-1:14:04</a>:</strong>  because now there's a huge diversity of other kinds of materials so kelp and lettuces and  tomatoes and all that remnant material think of all the different diversity of bacteria  and fungi that will be on there and protozoa and nematodes and most people don't like to<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:04">1:14:04-1:14:22</a>:</strong>  think of the fact that there ought to be nematodes on the surface of your tomato and you ought  to eat that tomato raw because you're re-inoculating your own biome with all these beneficial organisms  so you know I often say to people when you know that it's really good compost stick your<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:22">1:14:22-1:14:43</a>:</strong>  hands in there get a feel for it and then lick them right right because you're putting  all that wonderful diversity of microorganisms back into yourself that you require so making  diversity to go in yes then does time play a factor curing time curing time generally<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:14:43">1:14:43-1:15:03</a>:</strong>  starts the fungi growing and starting to win a bit more early on in the composting process  because you're going to turn it so many times and every time you turn that compost you're  slicing and dicing and crushing your fungi your protozoa your nematodes your micro arthropods<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:03">1:15:03-1:15:20</a>:</strong>  usually micro arthropods after a turn they're all going like no way we're out of here we're  gone not coming back so you got to leave that pile alone you got to let it mature if you  want the micro arthropods to come back in if you want the really good nematodes to come<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:20">1:15:20-1:15:42</a>:</strong>  back you've got to give time for those fungi to grow through your compost again and all  those strands start to get you know you're going from here's my bacteria here's my fungi  and through that curing system curing time those fungi are coming up and up and up so<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:15:42">1:15:42-1:16:04</a>:</strong>  how much good fungal foods did you have how many good bacterial foods did you have you  have to go back to your soil and determine what's missing in your soil how do you know  the kind of compost you need to make if you don't know what's missing in your soil if<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:04">1:16:04-1:16:25</a>:</strong>  what you're missing is fungi you only have disease-causing fungi in your soil so your  fungi way down here and your bacteria are up this high you got a lot of work to do and  you better make a compost that's almost strictly fungal well that's hard to do so you do the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:25">1:16:25-1:16:46</a>:</strong>  best that you can you get the fungi increased as great as you can but now in a year or two  do you still want to be making very fungal compost look at what's in your soil and that  tells you what you need to be adding and so now you see that I'm trying to grow tomatoes<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:16:46">1:16:46-1:17:05</a>:</strong>  and yet my fungal biomass is here and my bacterial biomass is here that's not what we want for  tomatoes we want this so now what do I do in my compost pile I put more green material  in because that's bacterial food and you get that ratio of bacteria and fungi back to what<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:05">1:17:05-1:17:18</a>:</strong>  it needs to be to grow your really healthy crop and you've only had to go out there once  to fix the problem.  So you create the compost that you need and you see a lot of people trying to speed up<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:18">1:17:18-1:17:33</a>:</strong>  compost compost in 30 days and that compost could be great compost in theory if that's  what your soil needs.  Yep and if you know for the when you're first making compost and you're kind of in this<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:33">1:17:33-1:17:52</a>:</strong>  I've got to get this compost in before I plan my plans so I've got to hurry hurry hurry  and I forgot to get started I forgot to okay so we want to hurry along the process of making  compost so it's a 21 day process if you really push it it's a 21 day process to bring that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:17:52">1:17:52-1:18:07</a>:</strong>  temperature right back down to ambient.  Do you really have as much diversity as you could have?  Well way better than the diversity that's in your dirt so get started with the process<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:07">1:18:07-1:18:28</a>:</strong>  but after you've gotten started and things are starting to get balanced and now not so  much work to do now let that pile mature longer now make a compost this spring that you're  not actually going to put on until after harvest next fall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:28">1:18:28-1:18:47</a>:</strong>  Now if you made a compost last November and you're just putting it out now check it make  sure that it's got really good fungi in it that what you want is there and because you  can always alter it by putting in the right kinds of foods.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:18:47">1:18:47-1:19:03</a>:</strong>  Yeah that makes a lot of sense when we think about adding compost to the soil we're adding  organic matter to the soil and when you think about organic matter that's one measure that  a lot of people use to judge their soil they say I started at 1% organic matter and now<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:03">1:19:03-1:19:14</a>:</strong>  I'm at 5% organic matter.  What are your thoughts about evaluating soil quality based upon the percent organic matter  in that soil?<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:14">1:19:14-1:19:30</a>:</strong>  You can get tricked by relying on just that one thing it's like relying on temperature  to tell you whether you're healthy or not.  Well your body temperature is not going to be increased when you're dying of cancer sorry<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:30">1:19:30-1:19:50</a>:</strong>  it's only good for certain things soil organic matter is good for certain types of information  but it doesn't tell you what's going to be going on with the biology.  We hope that when we put in fungal foods that it's going to feed a whole bunch of fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:19:50">1:19:50-1:20:09</a>:</strong>  and fungal biomass is going to increase what if you have no fungal spores what if there  aren't any fungi in the compost or no fungi in your soil so you put in fungal foods it's  kind of like going out into the middle of the Sahara Desert and putting down the most<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:09">1:20:09-1:20:27</a>:</strong>  incredible smorgasbord that anybody's ever seen on this planet nobody's there to eat  it so what good did it do?  Same thing with our compost you've got to make certain that we have really good fungi<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:27">1:20:27-1:20:45</a>:</strong>  in that pile especially if we're putting in lots of good fungal foods for those organisms  so be checking your starting materials and making sure you got some good fungi and when  in doubt go out someplace and take just the smallest tiniest little hand of something<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:20:45">1:20:45-1:21:04</a>:</strong>  that's got some good fungal strands in it you don't need much we do not need to be destroying  our ancient forests in order to build you a better compost pile so only take a very  small about put that spread that through your compost pile at the beginning of the composting<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:04">1:21:04-1:21:25</a>:</strong>  process so that if there were any diseases or pests in that little handful you're going  to deal with them if you look at your compost at the end of the composting process and you  can see that there's not a lot of really good fungi in there you'll probably want to go<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:25">1:21:25-1:21:42</a>:</strong>  out and buy some inocula so go out and get some turkey tail go out and get some oyster  mushroom go out and get whatever mushroom you want or one of the spent blocks from a  mushroom farm just make sure they don't autoclave it before they send it sell it to you you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:21:42">1:21:42-1:22:05</a>:</strong>  add that into your compost pile so you can always go to your grocery store and buy those  mushrooms you can go buy the blocks from someplace that's not going to autoclave them so that  you can be adding inoculum that you know has no disease or pest organisms in it so you're<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:05">1:22:05-1:22:21</a>:</strong>  not giving yourself a worse headache than if you hadn't put any of that inoculum in  so always building that material.  Focusing on organic matter for a second what are your thoughts on organic matter and that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:21">1:22:21-1:22:38</a>:</strong>  potentially being too high in the soil is there a point at which you would say there's  too much organic matter here's where I'm going with this line of thinking if you have too  much organic matter that tells me that the biology in the soil isn't consuming that organic<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:38">1:22:38-1:22:56</a>:</strong>  matter if it's just piling up and up and up you're adding it but you're not taking it  out of the system by the biology in the soil which leads me to believe that that soil might  not be as healthy as the organic matter percent would lead you to believe what are your thoughts<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:22:56">1:22:56-1:23:11</a>:</strong>  on organic matter being too high and just having too much organic matter.  And the only way you're going to know whether there's enough biology to be doing the proper  decomposition process is to use your microscope.<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:11">1:23:11-1:23:29</a>:</strong>  Are the organism numbers dense enough?  Because you can put on a miles worth of organic matter no organisms it's just next time it  rains it's going to get waterlogged and now it's going to cause you a horrible problem<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:29">1:23:29-1:23:47</a>:</strong>  so you've got to have all components within the system or the system can't work so yeah  make certain that you've got the organisms in the compost.  I go out to a lot of forests these days and I look at the what's on the surface of the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:23:47">1:23:47-1:24:08</a>:</strong>  forest floor and I see you know two or three inches worth of dead leaf material just sitting  on the forest floor go back a year from now now all that is is you've got three and a  half inches next year it's four inches next year it's four and a half and it just keeps<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:08">1:24:08-1:24:30</a>:</strong>  getting deeper and deeper and what that tells me is there are absolutely no fungi in that  in this poor forest this is a dead dying forest that I'm walking through and it's a you know  tears at your heartstrings to realize that you're walking through something that probably<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:30">1:24:30-1:24:48</a>:</strong>  human beings destroyed because of drift of toxic chemicals because somebody came in and  said oh these poor trees aren't growing very rapidly let's put out an inorganic fertilizer  and they absolutely killed all of the biology that makes that old growth forest be an old<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:24:48">1:24:48-1:25:07</a>:</strong>  growth forest so we have to make certain that the whole system is functioning make sure  that you've got the microorganisms well if this is an old growth forest I better be seeing  bacteria and fungi in the proper balances I need to see protozoa bacterial feeders strictly<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:07">1:25:07-1:25:26</a>:</strong>  bacterial feeders for the most part I need to see some protozoa but I don't want to see  really high levels because the fungi and the fungal feeders should be the things that are  really high in numbers I want to see my fungi really high when I pick up a handful of that<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:26">1:25:26-1:25:48</a>:</strong>  soil and break it open lots of good fungal strands in there but then I also want to be  seeing the nematodes in there and I want to be seeing the micro arthropods whose function  is to eat that fungi releasing the nutrients so the plants can grow I want to see earthworms<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:25:48">1:25:48-1:26:04</a>:</strong>  I want to see in catraids I want to see spiders and I want to everything should be present  so this can function properly so it's not just organic matter we can't use that as the  sole determinant of whether this system is healthy or not we've got to be looking at<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:04">1:26:04-1:26:23</a>:</strong>  the biology as well let's say I wanted to add more fungi to the soil I wanted to increase  the fungi relative to the bacteria in the soil and let's say this is good garden soil  it's not some burned out row crop field and let's say I'm adding a compost that I think<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:23">1:26:23-1:26:44</a>:</strong>  has a high amount of fungi in it when I introduce that compost to the soil I'm inoculating that  soil with fungi can I assume that that soil has enough food for those fungi to survive  or am I potentially just adding a bunch of fungi that aren't going to have a food supply<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:44">1:26:44-1:26:58</a>:</strong>  and they're just either going to die or go dormant because they don't have what they  need to thrive and proliferate in the soil so should I think about adding the inoculant  the compost along with a fungal food at the same time<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:26:58">1:26:58-1:27:19</a>:</strong>  again as the microscope is the easiest tool to tell you if you're the fun job that you've  added to the system are still growing you can also be looking at decomposition rate  of the fungal foods they should be disappearing if you've got that adequate fungal biomass<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:19">1:27:19-1:27:41</a>:</strong>  functioning in that material is the root mass from previous crops a fungal food typically  yes it's more on the fungal side than it is on the bacterial side because the plant is  typically going to be storing nutrients in that root system that are in a form that's<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:27:41">1:27:41-1:28:00</a>:</strong>  long term storage so it's protected by being structurally very difficult to break down  or the bacteria would break in and wipe out those root systems during the winter time  so roots tend to be more on that fungal side it depends on exactly which kind of plant<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:00">1:28:00-1:28:20</a>:</strong>  you're looking at you know you you when you look at root systems of the most rapidly growing  plants like kudzu on this planet their root systems grow so rapidly they're very juicy  very tender and they tend to be more bacterial food than fungal food so there there's some<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:20">1:28:20-1:28:40</a>:</strong>  variation there what's the carbon to nitrogen ratio things that have a cden ratio up around  20-25 there's going to be a goodly amount of bacterial food in there when we look at  perennial plants their fungal their carbon nitrogen ratios are typically up more around<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:28:40">1:28:40-1:29:03</a>:</strong>  100-150 more fungal food so probably the easiest way for human beings to look at that is oh  these are nice white kind of you know succulent root systems versus ooh these have got just  like a bark on them there's a outside layer that's highly suberized and that's going to<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:03">1:29:03-1:29:18</a>:</strong>  be more fungal food the fungi take care of that the bacteria take care of the simple  white roots probably the short term long term crops correlate a radish might be in the ground  for 30 days you're going to leave less root versus a tomato which is in the ground for<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:18">1:29:18-1:29:37</a>:</strong>  150 days more roots different type of roots yep and they have to protect themselves in  order not to be eaten by the bacteria we've already established that you're a big fan  of perennial ground cover that feeds the soil while the plant lives above surface let's<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:37">1:29:37-1:29:55</a>:</strong>  say i didn't use a perennial ground cover but i just had crops growing in the soil all  the time so they're putting root exudates into the soil and they're feeding the soil  that way they're my cash crops is that enough to feed the soil or would i get additional<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:29:55">1:29:55-1:30:12</a>:</strong>  benefit to the soil by putting something on top of it like a straw mulch i'm obviously  going to do things like save water and maybe cool the soil down by adding the mulch but  am i feeding the soil more and is that really that much better than just keeping a constant<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:12">1:30:12-1:30:31</a>:</strong>  crop in the soil where the roots of the crop are feeding the soil um straw is going to  be fungal food more than than it is bacterial food so if that's what you need to be pushing  fungal biomass the straw might work for that particular process quite well protecting the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:31">1:30:31-1:30:54</a>:</strong>  soil surface but once the fungi get going on that straw the fungi are going to decompose  that now you're left with no protection if you're growing a some kind of living surface  material maybe not perennial you've chosen something that grows typically in a fungal<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:30:54">1:30:54-1:31:17</a>:</strong>  the bacterial biomass ratio close to one to one so it's you know it's got some fungal  foods in that material but um still a little bit more on the bacterial dominant side um  as long as those are the plants that you want to be you know you want to put in tomatoes<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:17">1:31:17-1:31:38</a>:</strong>  potatoes and things like that into those kinds of beds um then that's a that's a good match  for what you do want to be growing there but if you wanted to grow blueberries in there  you wanted to grow apricots or mango or something like that um not going to give you the best<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:31:38">1:31:38-1:32:00</a>:</strong>  response so it's there's no kind of one single answer people always ask me what what's the  best compost to make and my response has always got to be it depends what are you trying to  grow what's missing in your soil are these the best plant cover that i could have what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:00">1:32:00-1:32:17</a>:</strong>  the best elaine tell me what to do and i'm sorry nature doesn't work that way you're  going to have to use your own brain yeah you've got to pay attention you've got to be talking  to mother nature and the way she talks to us is by what's going on in that soil what's<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:17">1:32:17-1:32:40</a>:</strong>  going on with your plants so we have to learn how to interpret those signals which means  you can't be really you can't be a lazy farmer you gotta pay attention to what mother nature's  telling you so in terms of quality compost you've looked at a lot of compost on farms<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:40">1:32:40-1:32:58</a>:</strong>  you've made a lot of compost you've looked at a lot of composts under the microscope  what are your thoughts on biodynamic compost it gets a lot of hype a lot of people believe  in it a lot of people really advocate for it is that compost better than their average<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:32:58">1:32:58-1:33:24</a>:</strong>  compost and is it all that it's cracked up to be there's there's nothing that does it  all for all conditions all places all crops etc um it's you've got to fine-tune it more  than that um and you know robert um steiner came up with systems that worked really well<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:24">1:33:24-1:33:45</a>:</strong>  for the part of the world that he was working in he was paying attention to what mother  nature was telling him and now how do you get those concepts across to the general public  and so he tried very hard to do that it's his followers that really take what he was<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:33:45">1:33:45-1:34:10</a>:</strong>  talking about and turn it into this um hardcore this is the way steiner said it has to be  doing be done it's you know page 25 it says this is what you have to do when he was probably  my belief is that he was probably trying to answer somebody's specific question about<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:10">1:34:10-1:34:32</a>:</strong>  what was going to work and best in their land under their conditions in their climate yada  yada and it just gets too hardline when people do that and it scares me a lot when when i  think about you know people um being proponents of what i do and they get just a little too<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:32">1:34:32-1:34:57</a>:</strong>  rigid everything's got to have this well no the the the sentence we should always be using  is it depends take a look at the system what's lacking what are you trying to grow what are  the weather conditions where you are we're going to do different things in islam than<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:34:57">1:34:57-1:35:21</a>:</strong>  we're going to do in panama period full stop across the line well it's not the same crops  in those two places it's um you know you're going to got freezing soil most of the year  in island you never have freezing conditions in panama so the overarching principles are<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:21">1:35:21-1:35:42</a>:</strong>  the same everywhere on the planet but they have to be interpreted for the place and time  so at the end of the day would you pay money a lot of money to get like this much inoculant  to add to a compost pile do you think that you're going to get the results would you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:35:42">1:35:42-1:36:00</a>:</strong>  pay the money probably not i would multiply it see what i would do is take that inoculum  put it into a compost mix find out what's really what's the inoculum what's in that  inoculum is it just bacterial does it have the fungi does it have the protozoa does it<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:00">1:36:00-1:36:18</a>:</strong>  have the nematodes and i would be willing to bet you that you don't find any inoculum  that comes in a little tiny container like that that has the whole food web in it those  are probably a couple of species of bacteria in there if you're lucky there might be some<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:18">1:36:18-1:36:48</a>:</strong>  fungi but you know it's like with dr jika's work in japan he isolated a certain set of  microorganisms that do very well in preventing club root on cauliflower coal and kale crops  but it doesn't really work for other kinds of crops with different diseases in different<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:36:48">1:36:48-1:37:17</a>:</strong>  climates lactobacillus is mainly what he he isolated i think it was like five or six different  species of lactobacillus a couple species of pseudomonas a couple species of bacillus  a couple of other species of non-sulfur purple photosynthetic bacterium which i love the<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:37:17">1:37:17-1:37:41</a>:</strong>  name of that organism because it's like this long and that's what's in his inoculum well  it it does great for brassicas in a soil that's not bacterial enough that doesn't have enough  actinomyces in it or actinobacteria sorry the old-fashioned name actinomycetes but they<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:37:41">1:37:41-1:38:08</a>:</strong>  are bacteria so they're actually actinobacteria it doesn't do much if you have a tomato that's  being attacked by fusarium not going to shut that down at all so you've got to start understanding  what is the problem that your plants got what's not present in the soil what's missing and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:08">1:38:08-1:38:33</a>:</strong>  therefore i know what i need to do a lot of times we'll use biocontrol agents to start  dealing with the problem so i have an outbreak of verticillium on my potatoes i'm going to  make up a compost tea where i am going to put a teaspoon of spores of trichoderma into<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:33">1:38:33-1:38:51</a>:</strong>  that compost tea and i know that in the next 24 hours all of those spores in that compost  tea are going to germinate and they're going to start to grow if you didn't have the rest  of the organisms in that water those trichoderma spores would never germinate they would never<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:38:51">1:38:51-1:39:16</a>:</strong>  be growing so you've got to have the biology to get this reaction all of the trichoderma  are now growing i spray that out each one of those spores that comes anywhere near to  a verticillium hypha now grows that the trichoderma hypha grows into the hypha of the verticillium<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:16">1:39:16-1:39:41</a>:</strong>  and eats the verticillium out from the inside out and within a day or two that whole verticillium  plague just disappears we can do the same thing for fusarium we can do the same thing  for any one of the omicids any one of the disease-causing fungi so we'll start off perhaps<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:39:41">1:39:41-1:40:03</a>:</strong>  with that step that solves the outbreak problem but now because the trichoderma has been in  there and it's attacked any fungus not just for the psyllium not just for xerium not just  any one of those other disease-causing fungi it's wiped them all out the good guys as well<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:03">1:40:03-1:40:24</a>:</strong>  as the bad so how are we going to manage to keep growing the tomatoes or keep growing  the cauliflower or keep growing whatever plant it was we've got to put back an inoculum of  those beneficial organisms that were wiped out by the biocontrol agent that we used so<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:24">1:40:24-1:40:44</a>:</strong>  we'll come back in another 24 hours well typically we leave about two weeks for the trichoderma  to get over itself it has there's no more fungi no more food so it goes dormant produces  spores the spores don't germinate and start to grow unless they're in a compost tea with<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:44">1:40:44-1:40:59</a>:</strong>  all those other microorganisms so all those spores of the trichoderma they're sitting  out in that ecosystem that most of them are not going to germinate most of them are going  to hang out and wait until the very specific conditions they need in order to grow are<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:40:59">1:40:59-1:41:18</a>:</strong>  met so we don't have to worry about them now now we go out and we put out an inoculum of  really good fungi we replenish the organisms that got wiped out by the biocontrol agent  and your system comes back into a condition of health so you've got to understand these<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:18">1:41:18-1:41:42</a>:</strong>  kinds of subtle interactions and we go through a lot of that in the foundation courses at  so food web school so that people get that experience we have a section of success stories  that people can go to and and look what did this person do under these conditions to get<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:41:42">1:41:42-1:42:04</a>:</strong>  this success story so accumulating more and more of those kinds of stories gives people  better and better ideas of what they need to do to fix every particular problem that  they have what about mycorrhizal fungi would you think about adding those to a system at<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:04">1:42:04-1:42:21</a>:</strong>  the very beginning they can only survive when they're near living roots so you would have  to plant them at the same time you planted a crop and do you think that they could survive  in the soil in between crop rotations or come winter where you wouldn't have to re-inoculate<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:21">1:42:21-1:42:42</a>:</strong>  the soil again with them i would want to use my microscope and make sure that they act  those root systems are actually colonized and so by putting your washing your roots  off putting them on your microscope and illuminating them either using an epifluorescent microscope<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:42:42">1:42:42-1:43:04</a>:</strong>  or just taking a handheld uv lamp and illuminating that root system you should be able to see  the fluorescent arbus skills in that root system and then you know that it's colonized  there's no question you're not trying to guess so if you've got dirt absolutely putting in<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:04">1:43:04-1:43:24</a>:</strong>  a mycorrhizal inoculum is a very good idea but you don't want to put it out in just mix  it into the soil because you know you've only got a few million spores in any packet typically  that you're getting and you've got to make sure that those spores are associated with<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:24">1:43:24-1:43:45</a>:</strong>  the root system and if you just mix the spores into the soil or into the dirt you're probably  not going to get any or very few of those spores are actually going to get within 10  micrometers of that root system that's about the distance that the spore has to be for<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:43:45">1:43:45-1:44:02</a>:</strong>  it to germinate and grow and make it through and colonize that root system before it runs  out of the energy that was in that spore that's all the energy it's gotten if they're too  far away if they germinate and grow they'll die before they get there so they probably<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:02">1:44:02-1:44:23</a>:</strong>  will never germinate so what I like to do instead if you're going to put a plant in  that requires mycorrhizal colonization and not all plants need mycorrhizal fungi and  there are some plants that will be harmed by mycorrhizal colonization so you know we<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:23">1:44:23-1:44:45</a>:</strong>  you need to know what kind of plant are you planting so where we know that we need the  mycorrhizal fungi and you suspect you don't have any mycorrhizal fungi in your soil what  you want to do is take your seeds put them into a compost extract mix in some mycorrhizal<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:44:45">1:44:45-1:45:13</a>:</strong>  spores because the mycorrhizal spores stick to organic matter they stick they adhere they're  there you can't wash them off so you pull your seeds out of that seed drench or maybe  other people what they'd like to do is put the seeds out on a moving belt and just spritz<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:13">1:45:13-1:45:33</a>:</strong>  those seeds as they go by with that mixture of a compost tea with mycorrhizal spores in  it the mycorrhizal the tea organisms will stick to the seed surface and so will the  mycorrhizal spores you let it dry down a little bit and into your planter box it goes and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:33">1:45:33-1:45:56</a>:</strong>  you go out and plant and then as soon as that seed germinates and that root starts coming  out these mycorrhizal spores are right Johnny on the spot starting to form that connection  between the mycorrhizal fungus and the root system so making certain that you have a higher<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:45:56">1:45:56-1:46:17</a>:</strong>  percentage of success is a really important thing to do when you deal with good money  on it too right right they those spores are not cheap but understandably so it's not easy  to grow those root systems get the mycorrhizal fungi to grow on those root systems get them<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:17">1:46:17-1:46:39</a>:</strong>  to make the extramatrical spores and then collect all those extramatrical spores that's  not a cheap job that's not inexpensive so you want to make certain that when you grow  on things like brassica coal kale crops things like that those are non-mycorrhizal plants<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:39">1:46:39-1:46:58</a>:</strong>  so don't be inoculating those root systems or those seeds with the mycorrhizal spores  because you're going to make things worse it's hard for those plants to support their  own growth requirements as well as the mycorrhizal spore it doesn't do that job of bringing nutrients<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:46:58">1:46:58-1:47:17</a>:</strong>  to the coal and kale crops is this another justification is this another reason why somebody  might not want to use a crop rotation you build up a population of mycorrhizal fungi  that associate themselves with a certain crop they're in the soil you plant them season<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:17">1:47:17-1:47:31</a>:</strong>  after season rotation after rotation and that population of mycorrhizal fungi stays strong  you rotate in another crop that might not form the same association with those same  mycorrhizal fungi and the ones that you've built up in the soil may go dormant they may<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:31">1:47:31-1:47:50</a>:</strong>  die off so next time your crop comes back into the rotation the fungi that used to be  there and associated with those roots might not be there or there might be less of them  in the soil so is this a reason to potentially not rotate crops yep yep and so why did you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:47:50">1:47:50-1:48:10</a>:</strong>  do that to yourself have a section of your garden that is for the brassica coal and kale  crops the mustards and that part yeah you could rotate within that area if you want  to follow organic regs and and not get dinged and then over here you would have your needs<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:10">1:48:10-1:48:31</a>:</strong>  mycorrhizal colonization so that you're maintaining that soil as close as possible to the perfect  condition for those crops in terms of colonization of the soil and in terms of colonization of  the soil what are your thoughts on biochar one thing biochar has a lot of is surface<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:31">1:48:31-1:48:52</a>:</strong>  area and that provides area for bacteria and other organisms within the soil to colonize  it there's a big push behind biochar there's a lot of advocates of it what are your thoughts  of it as a soil amendment is it worth it would you use it what are your thoughts i you know<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:48:52">1:48:52-1:49:12</a>:</strong>  people will say the same thing about putting clay into compost you need to give the microorganisms  more surface area to grow on and i always like to kind of point out to them that um  there's a lot of organic matter in a compost pile how much surface area does that organic<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:12">1:49:12-1:49:32</a>:</strong>  matter have more than enough there is buku surfaces adding more surfaces that need to  be colonized is that going to is that going to improve things in that compost pile is  it going to improve things in your soil if you've got now three percent ten percent twenty<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:32">1:49:32-1:49:57</a>:</strong>  fifty percent organic matter in your soil how would adding biochar really make that  much of a difference so i don't buy that one especially if a biochar doesn't have any bio  on the char i don't think that's particularly very worthwhile unless of course you've got<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:49:57">1:49:57-1:50:16</a>:</strong>  a problem with a huge compaction if you've got a lot of compaction problems in your soil  now mixing in biochar that's going to give you fluff that's going to force air space  in there and so you can see a big effect with biochar if you had compaction problems in<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:16">1:50:16-1:50:39</a>:</strong>  your soil well what if you don't have compaction i i don't see any benefits to adding biochar  if you've already got good structure in your soil you don't need to add air spaces to allow  oxygen and water and organisms and roots to grow through um what really are the nutrients<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:50:39">1:50:39-1:51:09</a>:</strong>  that are inside biochar when you start looking at wood chips it's mostly carbon it's got  a little bit of nitrogen a little bit of other nutrients but nowhere near what your plant's  really going to need so i we've did we did an experiment when i was at rhodale um so<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:09">1:51:09-1:51:30</a>:</strong>  we looked at where we added a small amount of biochar i can't remember exactly how much  a little bit higher level of biochar a lot more biochar and then where we did nothing  we didn't add any biochar at all to that soil otherwise the practices were exactly the same<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:30">1:51:30-1:51:53</a>:</strong>  on everything in that field and as the crop grew and i think it was um soybean it's probably  soybean as the soybean grew there was absolutely no difference in anything they were all the  same height they were all had all had the same nutrient concentration the biology and<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:51:53">1:51:53-1:52:09</a>:</strong>  the soil was the same pretty much throughout because it was a soil that was already pretty  good structure because of all of the organic material in there all the organisms i mean  this was rhodale they're one of the original organic farms on the planet so it had good<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:09">1:52:09-1:52:31</a>:</strong>  structure there ain't no difference how much biochar and boy the person who bought that  biochar for that experiment was not happy with us not our fault we did exactly what  the experimental design was so put in biochar when biochar is going to give you a benefit<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:31">1:52:31-1:52:48</a>:</strong>  but if you can't think how that biochar is going to improve things for the organisms  in the soil or for the root system of your plant then it's probably not going to benefit  you at all and so why spend your money do you think the argument for sequestering carbon<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:52:48">1:52:48-1:53:04</a>:</strong>  in the soil is a good enough argument to justify the use of biochar let's say you're not even  buying it so you take the money out of the equation and you're making it with scrap material  you can sequester carbon in the soil at no cost is that enough of a benefit to justify<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:04">1:53:04-1:53:28</a>:</strong>  using it my attitude of course is always uh why not just take all that really wonderful  wood material and make it into compost it's going to have a much longer effect and it's  going to actually provide food once you take wood and you turn it into charcoal it's really<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:28">1:53:28-1:53:52</a>:</strong>  hard for the microorganisms to use that it's a long-term stable compound but it's not giving  the microorganisms all that much benefit so if it was the only way we could get enough  carbon into the soil would be to bury all that that biochar okay but we have other ways<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:53:52">1:53:52-1:54:08</a>:</strong>  to stabilize carbon in the soil that makes a lot of sense and i love everything that  you've shared in this interview i want to thank you for taking some time to come on  today and talk all things soil on the podcast so thank you for that in terms of your courses<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:54:08">1:54:08-1:54:30</a>:</strong>  people can learn more about that at soilfoodweb.com what do you have in store there anything new  coming up with the courses or the website um we've started the um launch your own lab  where we're teaching people to use the microscope um and then um advertise that they will take<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:54:30">1:54:30-1:54:51</a>:</strong>  other people's um samples so we've got massive numbers of people around the world that are  um learning how to do this so that if you don't really want to be looking through a  microscope you could have someone fairly local that would be able to do that work for you<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:54:51">1:54:51-1:55:10</a>:</strong>  they can you know bring them their so the bring them your soil and you could even stand  there and watch them do your sample and they'll show you exactly what they're seeing on the  computer screen so that you can go oh well i just really don't have any nematodes in<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:55:10">1:55:10-1:55:33</a>:</strong>  there do i or fungi or your bacteria are just out of control so you know exactly what you  need to do that's one of the more recent things we also have a lot of consultants that we're  training all over the world so that they can take you through the whole process of assessing<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:55:33">1:55:33-1:55:51</a>:</strong>  your soil what determining what's missing now what's the best way for your soil type  for this climate for the exact crop you're trying to grow what's the best way to get  that biology into the soil so you have the greatest improvement as rapidly as possible<br />
<strong><a href="https://insearchofsoil.libsyn.com/full-episode#t=1:55:51">1:55:51-1:56:11</a>:</strong>  so that's what we're training our consultants to be able to do with people so keep an eye  out for for those folks and you know contact us if you want to know who's closest to you  or who works on the kind of crop that you are working on and you'd like to have some<br />
