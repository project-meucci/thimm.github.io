<p><strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:13</a>:</strong>  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the Agtenti Group.  I'm Sarah Nollet.  This episode is the third and final in our Lessons from Later Stage AgTech Founders series.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:00:13">0:00:13-0:00:27</a>:</strong>  And today we'll hear from a founder of one of the best known agtech startups globally,  which has recently announced a $300 million funding round.  One of their secrets to success is a farmer-centric approach that has become a company ideology.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:00:27">0:00:27-0:00:42</a>:</strong>  I think so much of the Silicon Valley narrative when people raise money or when people start  companies is just founder obsessed.  For us, that's kind of just not who we are and it's kind of not our personalities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:00:42">0:00:42-0:00:52</a>:</strong>  And you know, we didn't really see the benefit in it.  That's Charles Barron, the co-founder and chief innovation officer at Farmers Business  Network or FBN.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:00:52">0:00:52-0:01:02</a>:</strong>  FBN started eight years ago by linking thousands of farmers in North America in a co-op style  model, using the power of their member network to deliver transparent input pricing and lower  costs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:02">0:01:02-0:01:12</a>:</strong>  Now, they have several other businesses, including a finance marketplace for farmers and an analytics  platform for grain and inputs.  FBN has been in the news a bunch along the way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:12">0:01:12-0:01:23</a>:</strong>  In the early days, they raised money from big name Silicon Valley investors such as  GV, formerly Google Ventures, and Kleiner Perkins.  Then in 2020, they hit the headlines again as they collided with established agribusiness<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:23">0:01:23-0:01:35</a>:</strong>  players in a Canadian antitrust case.  Along the way, they've also expanded to Australia, grown the team to over 800 employees with  plans to hire over 350 more next year and currently have about 34,000 members.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:35">0:01:35-0:01:46</a>:</strong>  So where did it all begin?  Well, as you're about to hear Charles explain, the idea for FBN was born when love forced  his Silicon Valley world to collide with rural Nebraska.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:46">0:01:46-0:01:58</a>:</strong>  So I actually grew up in California.  I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area in Palo Alto, right in the heart of Silicon Valley.  Always was very interested in technology and just, you know, out here, startups are kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:01:58">0:01:58-0:02:12</a>:</strong>  of in the water and in the DNA.  Cousins had started a company called the dazzle.com and was always just very interested in entrepreneurship.  For me, I got into agriculture, you know, I joke the very old fashioned way, which is<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:12">0:02:12-0:02:20</a>:</strong>  that I married into it because, you know, I was I was from an urban area from the Bay  Area.  My wife is from central Nebraska, from Kearney, Nebraska.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:20">0:02:20-0:02:32</a>:</strong>  I met my future brother in law who farms out there in Arapahoe, Nebraska, right when we  were getting out of college.  And that was actually my first time on a real production commodity farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:32">0:02:32-0:02:48</a>:</strong>  So when at that time, I just became completely fascinated by farming, really knew nothing  about it before then, hadn't appreciated the life of a farm or the complexity of farming.  In fact, it really never never registered for me.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:48">0:02:48-0:02:59</a>:</strong>  I kind of, you know, being from a big city and then going to school on the East Coast,  just hadn't thought much about it.  So but when I spent time with Anthony, it just blew me away.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:02:59">0:02:59-0:03:12</a>:</strong>  It blew me away, blew me away how complex the job was, how much responsibility one person  has on a farm.  And I ended up spending a corn harvest with him going around working, whatever I could<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:12">0:03:12-0:03:21</a>:</strong>  do, however I could be useful, I needed an excuse to be in Nebraska chasing my girlfriend  around.  He had me, you know, driving the grain cart, helping them drive the combine.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:21">0:03:21-0:03:34</a>:</strong>  But you know, the daily life of a farm is something people really don't appreciate.  You get up at, you know, 6am, and you're starting with feeding the cattle and mixing the feed  in the feed wagon, and then you're going out and fixing some pivots and moving irrigation<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:34">0:03:34-0:03:42</a>:</strong>  pipe.  And then you're going out and preparing the tractor to haul the grain cart, and then you're  going and doing a little bit of harvesting if the weather's good.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:42">0:03:42-0:03:56</a>:</strong>  In the middle of all that, you're buying and selling commodities, you're managing input  purchases, you're dealing with being an entrepreneur, you're probably dealing with legal issues,  you're dealing with family issues that are also popping up, which also, you know, get<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:03:56">0:03:56-0:04:02</a>:</strong>  into the business.  So it's a remarkably complex job.  And I just was utterly blown away by it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:02">0:04:02-0:04:15</a>:</strong>  I had no appreciation of it, and had become, you know, fascinated by it ever since.  Charles has painted a pretty accurate picture of what farming life can be like, and spending  time there piqued his interest in the industry.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:15">0:04:15-0:04:30</a>:</strong>  So while Charles was forging ahead with his career, including being a manager at Google  and going to Harvard Business School, he regularly traveled back to Nebraska and Kansas.  There are a couple very notable early impressions that spending time on the farm really left<br />

You know, one is, as I said, the complexity of the farm job.  But number two was, you know, a story I tell a lot, which is, you know, riding around the<br />

And here you are in central Nebraska, and the announcer is talking about getting rain  in Brazil.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:04:47">0:04:47-0:05:02</a>:</strong>  And they're saying, okay, you know, there's rain in Brazil, so beans are down a point.  And you go, what in the world does Brazil have to do with central Nebraska?  And, you know, it's that you're operating in this globally interconnected commodity<br />

And there really isn't, that I can think of, a good example of another industry that is<br />

When I got out of business school, Amol and I, Amol Deshpande, who's our CEO and founder,  and we had known each other, you know, just in the Valley, his brother actually worked<br />

So, you know, Amol had really helped ignite a lot of early venture and incubations in  food and ag from Sand Hill Road.<br />

<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:06:41">0:06:41-0:06:55</a>:</strong>  And we had gotten to know this group and really spent a lot of time with them trying to understand  what they were doing and why they wanted to do it.  And what we kept running up against when you asked these early farms, you know, why they<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:06:55">0:06:55-0:07:06</a>:</strong>  were willing to share data with each other, you got to the fact that they fundamentally  didn't trust the people they did business with, and that there were these very basic  information gaps.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:06">0:07:06-0:07:18</a>:</strong>  So, the example was, you know, one farm was the other farmer's seed dealer, and one of  the guys, you know, was basically requiring his seed dealer to say, hey, show me your  yield maps before you try and sell me the seed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:18">0:07:18-0:07:22</a>:</strong>  I don't want to hear it from you.  I actually want to see the yield maps on your fields.  I don't want to see your test plot.<br />

And so he'd make the other farmer bring his yield maps in, show him all the pictures,  show him exactly how the seeds performed.<br />

This is in Northern Illinois, for example.  And they'd find these 20, 30 bushel swings in between their two farms, you know, in the<br />

And what you realized was that when you kept pushing with them on why they wanted that  information, why they wanted to be able to share data, and what was causing the root<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:07:57">0:07:57-0:08:11</a>:</strong>  problems, it was fundamentally that the market and the industry would not or could not give  the information to farmers to help them make an actual transparent decision that they would  trust.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:11">0:08:11-0:08:25</a>:</strong>  And there's a lot of reasons for that because the amount of consolidation that is taking  place in the industry, the oligopoly nature of the industry, the extreme pricing power  that the trait originators developed with trait licensing, therefore then the lack of<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:25">0:08:25-0:08:36</a>:</strong>  price transparency in the market, the fact that no seed prices are put online, no seeds  are generally sold out of the zone, what are called seed pricing zones, no seeds are sold  across state lines.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:36">0:08:36-0:08:47</a>:</strong>  And the same situation, a very similar situation exists in the chemical market.  And that situation, farmers had just kind of come to accept a little bit as this is  the way the world works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:47">0:08:47-0:08:55</a>:</strong>  But when you look at it from the outside, which we were a little bit of outsiders and  insiders, we, you know, Amol had been working in food and ag, obviously, he was a car dealer  as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:08:55">0:08:55-0:09:03</a>:</strong>  And, you know, I had my family's experiences.  When you looked at it from the outside, you said, this makes absolutely no sense.  It makes literally no sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:03">0:09:03-0:09:12</a>:</strong>  How can an industry be a $20 billion, $25 billion industry?  You look at crop protection and seed in North America.  And nobody puts a price on line.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:12">0:09:12-0:09:25</a>:</strong>  You know, nobody can actually show you how the seeds performing on other farms.  Every seed company just makes claims about their plot trial where miraculously their  seeds always with, you know, so it was kind of ludicrous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:25">0:09:25-0:09:36</a>:</strong>  But that had come to be the state of the world in agriculture.  And so the early farmers in F.B.N. really honed in on these problems and really honed  in on the problems in the market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:36">0:09:36-0:09:49</a>:</strong>  And then, you know, what I would say was sort of the founding insight of F.B.N. and, you  know, the starting point, which really just the position of the farmer in the farm economy  where the farmer is stuck between these oligopolists on either side.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:09:49">0:09:49-0:10:00</a>:</strong>  You have oligopoly players in ag, chem and seed and retail.  And then on the other side of grain marketing and meatpacking.  And then in the middle you have, you know, two million farms at an extreme information<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:00">0:10:00-0:10:11</a>:</strong>  disadvantage, an extreme market disadvantage, price disadvantage to those players.  And consequently, they have the lowest profitability and do the most work, take the most risk and  get the least rewards.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:11">0:10:11-0:10:25</a>:</strong>  And so that was the core of F.B.N. and that digital networks and online networks were  the best ways to solve that.  You know, in the past, people would create trade groups, trade associations or co-ops<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:25">0:10:25-0:10:33</a>:</strong>  or things like that.  But in the modern era, you would start with a network with an information system and create  a digitally connected ecosystem.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:33">0:10:33-0:10:41</a>:</strong>  And so that's where we started from.  And, you know, the roots of that was that we also would be very, very customer focused.  We'd be very customer obsessed.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:41">0:10:41-0:10:52</a>:</strong>  And we knew that we would end up building many platforms and pieces of F.B.N.  The sequencing was maybe a little more in question.  We didn't quite know the order in which we were going to start those things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:10:52">0:10:52-0:11:04</a>:</strong>  But we knew that, you know, we would be very responsive to farmer needs.  And so born out of that, listening to our growers really focusing on what their actual  problems were, not the problems we wanted to solve or the products we wanted to sell<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:04">0:11:04-0:11:18</a>:</strong>  them, but what was a fundamental problem in the market that they were really suffering  from, has really been at the genesis and root of F.B.N. since the beginning and has led  us to all the businesses that we've started on top of that platform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:18">0:11:18-0:11:27</a>:</strong>  Which we'll definitely get into.  I want to ask one more question about the early days.  So you guys raised, I think, a four to five, four point six million Series A in 2014 from<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:27">0:11:27-0:11:40</a>:</strong>  Kleiner Perkins and then a year later, like 15 from Google Ventures or G.V.  What were the conversations like about ag tech then?  Well, I think at that time there was a much smaller universe of people investing and it<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:40">0:11:40-0:11:53</a>:</strong>  was, you know, almost nobody's full time job to look at ag tech or look at agriculture  and understand it.  So I think for a lot of firms, it was probably more of a curiosity that they may have said,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:11:53">0:11:53-0:12:03</a>:</strong>  you know, I'm not sure if I have the mental bandwidth to go try and understand agriculture.  It's not like trying to understand enterprise SaaS where I can roll out of bed and there's  20 companies 10 minutes from here.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:03">0:12:03-0:12:06</a>:</strong>  I got a flight to Nebraska.  That's a lot of work.  I'm not sure I want to do that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:06">0:12:06-0:12:20</a>:</strong>  So I think that, frankly, kept a lot of people from understanding just how important and  big and technological the ag industry was.  And by a lot of people, I mean a lot of people in Silicon Valley and VCs and entrepreneurs.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:20">0:12:20-0:12:27</a>:</strong>  But, you know, we had the benefit of having some really great investors early who had  some experience in it.  Right.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:27">0:12:27-0:12:34</a>:</strong>  And they had they had known a bit about it.  So obviously the KP team through a mole and the work he had done.  And then GV had done some investing as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:34">0:12:34-0:12:49</a>:</strong>  I think they had been involved in Climate Corp and a few others early.  DBL, who got involved with us, which stands for Double Bottom Line Investors.  They had been a very mission driven fund and we pitched them immediately upon creating<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:49">0:12:49-0:12:59</a>:</strong>  the company.  And I think what resonated with them was our focus and mission on our our customers.  And whereas they had done almost no food and ag investing at that time.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:12:59">0:12:59-0:13:07</a>:</strong>  So I think the reasons people were investing back then were a little different maybe than  now.  It wasn't quite so much of a known class or an asset class.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:07">0:13:07-0:13:17</a>:</strong>  And there weren't quite as many dedicated funds.  There may have been one or two and there have been some strategic funds.  But it was a pretty different landscape at that time, for sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:17">0:13:17-0:13:34</a>:</strong>  One thing Charles quickly realized back then was that FBN would have to work like agriculture  does, as much or more than like Silicon Valley.  So we always knew at a very visceral and personal level, you cannot work in agriculture remotely.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:34">0:13:34-0:13:45</a>:</strong>  And a whole lot of companies or startups, you know, at that time were based out here  or based in Silicon Valley or somewhere else.  And and like, OK, I'm going to throw up a website and I've got this whizbang technology<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:45">0:13:45-0:13:52</a>:</strong>  and I'll and I'll and obviously farmers are going to want it and it's going to work.  It's just not the way it works.  It's not the way rural America works.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:52">0:13:52-0:13:58</a>:</strong>  It's not the way agriculture works.  So so we knew that very early.  Our first office was not in Silicon Valley.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:13:58">0:13:58-0:14:11</a>:</strong>  Our first office was in Davenport, Iowa.  And before we ever even had an office, we were still squatting and just camped out working  sometimes in the Kleiner basement, sometimes at home here in California.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:11">0:14:11-0:14:22</a>:</strong>  Meanwhile we opened an office in Davenport, Iowa, because it was so important to be close  to our farms and our customers.  And our very first team members who we hired out there were in data processing and data<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:22">0:14:22-0:14:33</a>:</strong>  ops and then what became our customer group and our sales team.  And a lot of those that that those first three or four people who opened our Davenport office  are still leaders in the company today, eight years later, which has been really fun.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:33">0:14:33-0:14:44</a>:</strong>  So always from the beginning, always at the core of the company was having a very close  contact with our farmers, a place where our farmers could come and visit and that we could  talk to.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:44">0:14:44-0:14:54</a>:</strong>  And we spent huge amounts of time, even though we were based out here, we spent huge amounts  of time on the road, on farms, at trade shows, doing whatever we needed to do to have very  close contact with the customers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:14:54">0:14:54-0:15:03</a>:</strong>  So I think that was sort of first and most fundamentally.  But also one of the best things we did was really think very hard about our culture at  the very beginning.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:03">0:15:03-0:15:16</a>:</strong>  And at the very beginning of a company, there are so many things that are immediate priorities  and life and death because you literally have to do everything.  You have to go get it the main name, you have to deal with all the legal and preparation,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:16">0:15:16-0:15:27</a>:</strong>  you have to go start putting the product together.  And there's just the list of tasks is very, very long.  And so thinking about culture kind of feels like a little bit of a luxury where you think,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:27">0:15:27-0:15:40</a>:</strong>  oh, my gosh, I can, you know, do we really have time to do this?  And we actually made ourselves write up our first job spec for the first time we're actually  going to post and start recruiting to hire somebody.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:40">0:15:40-0:15:45</a>:</strong>  And we made ourselves sit down and say, what is this company?  What are we all about?  Who are we?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:45">0:15:45-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  Who are the people that we want to be on this journey and on this team?  And that really, again, went back to farmers, and it went back to our customers.  And that, especially in the early days of the company, but you know, it's just as relevant<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:10</a>:</strong>  today, folks had to be on board for the mission.  And they had to be interested and passionate about this world and want to work for this  customer and be ready to do whatever it takes to solve farmers problems.<br />

And you know, our farm born, what we said was, you know, farm born values of our employees,  which fundamentally meant just getting stuff done, you know, thinking like a farmer, you<br />

Products got to get done, stuff has to get harvested, same thing, products got to get<br />

So having that kind of farmer work ethic, farmer mentality, also just culturally, it  was very important to us that if a farmer walked into our office or a farmer ever came<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:48">0:16:48-0:16:56</a>:</strong>  in, they felt like they're coming to somewhere they that resonated with them, you know, was  authentic to them.  And that one came very important to us as well.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:16:56">0:16:56-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  I think at the time, there was a funny story we used to tell, which was that I think Dropbox  had a decoration of a panda, it was like a statue in the front of their office, they  spent something like $100,000 on this statue.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:15</a>:</strong>  I don't know if that's actually true or not.  But that was the story.  And, you know, it was just like, okay, we know we're not going to be that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:15">0:17:15-0:17:28</a>:</strong>  Because, you know, can you imagine what how a farmer would feel if they walk into your  office, and you have a hundred thousand dollar Panda in your front of your office.  So there's a lot of the culture in Silicon Valley and the culture of startups, which,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:28">0:17:28-0:17:42</a>:</strong>  you know, I've been at Google, and Google had more perks than you can possibly imagine.  And as a as a workplace, if they felt that you're working in that environment, and here  I am, I'm out in the muck and the freezing cold or working cattle, and you guys are back<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:42">0:17:42-0:17:49</a>:</strong>  in this cush office.  So so that was kind of first and foremost is that farmers had to feel comfortable with  the company and with the employees.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:49">0:17:49-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  And that was just as true in Davenport, Iowa, as it was in Silicon Valley.  And in fact, we did have farmers walking off the street in Silicon Valley, it's really  funny.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:17:57">0:17:57-0:18:07</a>:</strong>  And lo and behold, some people are on vacation and some other people in the area of land  walked in off the street.  And you never would have thought, you know, farmers walking off the street in San Carlos,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:07">0:18:07-0:18:15</a>:</strong>  but we did have it happen.  So that was really important.  And actually, our early offices were were kind of a great cultural touch point for the<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:15">0:18:15-0:18:25</a>:</strong>  company.  You know, our very first office was in a garage and was in kind of a converted architects  studio garage in San Carlos, next to a paint factory.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:25">0:18:25-0:18:38</a>:</strong>  It was really pretty grim and had one bathroom and it was no conference room and you had  to you had to grid it out to be there.  And then we finally moved to a strip mall and a strip converted office in a strip mall.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:38">0:18:38-0:18:45</a>:</strong>  And that was a such a big step up.  We felt like we're such a grown up company because now we had two bathrooms, we had a  men's and a women's bathroom.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:45">0:18:45-0:18:57</a>:</strong>  We had a kitchen, we had all these things that were, wow, we're really getting to the  big time now.  And we were wedged between a children's dance studio and a used furniture shop in the strip<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:18:57">0:18:57-0:19:04</a>:</strong>  mall in San Carlos.  That was kind of a kind of a down and out strip, not down and out.  But I'd say it had seen better days and was going through a revival.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:04">0:19:04-0:19:16</a>:</strong>  And we were occupying one of the offices.  And so you'd have a lot of employees who would come by doing job interviews, and they would  come to the office, and they'd look around and they go, oh, like, I'm gonna go work at,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:16">0:19:16-0:19:28</a>:</strong>  you know, Google or Facebook or one of these places, or, you know, Survey Monkey, where,  you know, the just the perks are outrageous.  And we did have we did plenty of candidates who, you know, came to the office that, nope,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:28">0:19:28-0:19:36</a>:</strong>  not for me.  And then you had people come and go, yes, this is precisely what I want.  This is it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:36">0:19:36-0:19:40</a>:</strong>  This is a startup.  This is the ground floor.  And the values are in the right place.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:40">0:19:40-0:19:50</a>:</strong>  The money is not in the office, the money is in the customers and the technology, figuring  out how to build the business.  And you can see how we were prioritizing what our values are, where our focus was.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:19:50">0:19:50-0:20:02</a>:</strong>  And that really was great as a filter for getting the right people in the company.  It didn't make it easier to hire, for sure, because we were in, we were kind of not on  the main line.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:02">0:20:02-0:20:13</a>:</strong>  We were not in, you know, downtown San Francisco or Palo Alto, we were trying to hire engineers.  But when you came and you saw it, you had to, you knew what you're getting involved  with, you knew what you're signing up for.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:13">0:20:13-0:20:21</a>:</strong>  And so the right people joined the company.  And that's as important as anything is that making sure that the folks who are there are  there for the right reasons, they want to be there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:21">0:20:21-0:20:33</a>:</strong>  And the team we were able to build was super passionate and very committed.  And many, many of the folks who joined at that phase are still with us today, and especially  our great technical team that we built up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:33">0:20:33-0:20:43</a>:</strong>  And that really is the California office is mainly our technical and some corporate functions.  You know, especially people get into startups and they think, oh, I want to create something  really glamorous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:43">0:20:43-0:20:54</a>:</strong>  You know, you raise venture capital money and these numbers sound like big numbers.  You raise millions of dollars and you see all these media reports of glamorizing startups  and founders and all that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:20:54">0:20:54-0:21:05</a>:</strong>  And that was the exact opposite of what we wanted.  And it's the exact opposite of what we knew mattered to farmers and was going to make  us a successful company.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:21:05">0:21:05-0:21:17</a>:</strong>  Did you ever have the moment where you were at like a tech conference or something in  Silicon Valley and you were dressed like you were at an ag conference or vice versa?  I know there are my experiences that there's pretty different dress codes in those two<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:21:17">0:21:17-0:21:26</a>:</strong>  worlds.  Well, I think you just got to be honest to who you are.  And you just can't, you can't if you're, if you're trying to put on a costume in both<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:21:26">0:21:26-0:21:39</a>:</strong>  places, it's just, it's going to ring false for everybody.  So you know, we dress the same, speak the same, no matter who we are, you know, where  we are, where we're talking to once in a while, we have to put on a suit to do something.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:21:39">0:21:39-0:21:51</a>:</strong>  You know, if you go to Washington or something like that, but you know, otherwise we're the  same people if you see us in Silicon Valley or you see us and you know, out at a farm  show or at a farm in Nebraska or North Dakota.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:21:51">0:21:51-0:22:02</a>:</strong>  Tell me a little bit about how your role has evolved.  You know, in the early days you mentioned there's a longer to-do list than you can possibly  get through and everyone's a bit of a generalist, often kind of wearing a few different hats.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:02">0:22:02-0:22:12</a>:</strong>  How has your role as you know, you've moved from founder into to CIO now, like what are  some of the things you've taken on and how has your role in the different hats you've  had to wear changed?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:12">0:22:12-0:22:26</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so for me, you know, I let our product and technical, you know, build out in the  early days and then after about a year getting the product launched, we had to start figuring  out how to launch the company and actually get into the market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:26">0:22:26-0:22:35</a>:</strong>  So then I took on the marketing aspects and then ran the marketing for several years as  well.  And then, you know, you grow and mature and we brought in a terrific CMO.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:35">0:22:35-0:22:47</a>:</strong>  And then now my focus is going back and figuring out the next frontiers for FBM, just sort  of being the entrepreneur within the startup and looking back for, you know, new ideas,  new concepts, new markets to apply the FBM platform.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:47">0:22:47-0:22:59</a>:</strong>  But it's an ongoing journey.  I think things change a lot and you have to, anybody who joined a startup at any, in any  role or any capacity or any stage has to understand that things are going to change and things<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:22:59">0:22:59-0:23:10</a>:</strong>  are going to change a fair amount.  But that adaptability and grip is a key component for anyone in any role.  And I think if people join startups and think things are going to be super stagnant and<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:10">0:23:10-0:23:20</a>:</strong>  I'm going to do this and go from level one, level two, level three, that's not the way  it goes in the early days of a company.  But as you get later and later and more mature, then you have to start building up that kind<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:20">0:23:20-0:23:29</a>:</strong>  of process and career progression.  How have you had to change along that journey?  You know, different roles, different hats, different responsibilities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:29">0:23:29-0:23:39</a>:</strong>  Have you had to change aspects of how you think about the world?  Well, roles change and adapt as you grow.  And in the very early phases, things are more conceptual.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:39">0:23:39-0:23:46</a>:</strong>  You're developing and testing your product for the first time.  You're talking to your first few customers and then you're trying to figure out how to  scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:46">0:23:46-0:23:57</a>:</strong>  And then you're trying to figure out how to get the right people on the team to create  the infrastructure that scales and the leadership that scales.  And you're constantly going through that evolution in all the aspects of the business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:23:57">0:23:57-0:24:07</a>:</strong>  And you know, at any given time in FBM, we have businesses that are fully mature, that  are what we would consider mature.  Like we know how to run them and they're up and running and we've got good product market<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:07">0:24:07-0:24:16</a>:</strong>  fit and they're scaling and they're growing.  And then we have businesses that are very immature, that are brand new or incubations  or new products spun off a business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:16">0:24:16-0:24:34</a>:</strong>  And I think for everybody that tests, you know, how you can kind of range from the early  phase of a concept where it's a little more isolated as you're developing something and  it's a little more one-to-one to then figuring out how to build an organization, a team and<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:34">0:24:34-0:24:47</a>:</strong>  technology and a business offering that can scale and building around that.  And so I think that's something that all our teams go through.  We're going a little bit back and forth, but that's the fun of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:47">0:24:47-0:24:59</a>:</strong>  Any mistakes that you've made along the way or things that looking back you sort of say,  I wish in power of hindsight, I had done that differently and learned a good lesson?  Oh sure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:24:59">0:24:59-0:25:09</a>:</strong>  There are many.  I have to think of them.  I think ultimately a lot of the things really come down to people and having the right people<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:09">0:25:09-0:25:18</a>:</strong>  in the early phases of a company.  As I said, you have a lot of generalists and you have to figure out when you need to make  the transition in roles to specialists.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:18">0:25:18-0:25:29</a>:</strong>  And I think for any manager also, you really just want to be bringing in people who are  better at that job than you are.  So if you're a generalist at the beginning and you're doing something that's more of<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:29">0:25:29-0:25:41</a>:</strong>  a stretch, then you really want to be quickly hiring someone who's vastly better at that  than you are because that's going to make the whole company better off.  So I think a whole lot of the kind of things that we might say, Hey, we should have done<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:41">0:25:41-0:25:50</a>:</strong>  A versus B, come down to those kinds of dynamics as well.  Do you have any advice for someone hiring someone who is meant to be better at the role  than they are?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:25:50">0:25:50-0:26:00</a>:</strong>  Like it can be hard to assess, especially if it's a technical role or a specialist role  where you're like, if they're better than me, then I'm not going to be able to assess  the quality of the exercise they complete in this interview process.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:00">0:26:00-0:26:06</a>:</strong>  Any kind of tips for how you actually figure out that they are better at that role or in  that specialty?  Yeah.<br />

But as far as I was concerned at FBN, one of the greatest days of my life at FBN was<br />

<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:30">0:26:30-0:26:45</a>:</strong>  And with Ed, we had a lot of great advisors and around FBN.  And so at the very beginning, even before we had a real team, we had partners, friends,  folks who had been product managers, been CTOs, been, you know, VP as a product as well,<br />

And they really help you through that process.  When you have a skillset that is truly beyond your skillset, like evaluating someone's technical<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:26:55">0:26:55-0:27:04</a>:</strong>  chops.  You know, he immediately just made a immediate transformation in the company, started bringing  over really top tier talent, some of our great early engineers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:04">0:27:04-0:27:16</a>:</strong>  And that just really created a sea change in our technical development and velocity.  But there's a myriad of those kind of functions.  But I think if you're getting into areas that you feel or skillsets you feel you don't understand<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:16">0:27:16-0:27:28</a>:</strong>  or you don't know as well, or you don't quite know how to judge, you have to go out to get  advice and get consultation from others.  But then, you know, ultimately, is this person a fit, you know, whether or not their skills<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:28">0:27:28-0:27:33</a>:</strong>  are there, is this person a fit for the company?  Are they fit culturally?  Do they really care about it?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:33">0:27:33-0:27:46</a>:</strong>  You know, some people just want to pass the interview.  Some people get into an interview, and it's kind of like passing a test.  And people are competitive and ambitious by nature, and they want to get through the test.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:46">0:27:46-0:27:54</a>:</strong>  But you know, do they really want to be here?  And are they ready to go to North Dakota in winter to go talk to farmers, you know, at  the drop of a hat?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:27:54">0:27:54-0:28:05</a>:</strong>  And so you really have to try and filter for that as hard as you can, because ultimately,  that's going to be the test of, you know, someone's going to be really successful here.  Yeah, and it goes back to what you said about values, right?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:05">0:28:05-0:28:16</a>:</strong>  Like knowing who you guys are and what it actually means to be successful at FBN and  to align with customers.  One of the other things you mentioned is not wanting to build the profile of the founders.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:16">0:28:16-0:28:25</a>:</strong>  I mean, you've done very few interviews about your personal journey.  I'm all the same.  There's yet this kind of Silicon Valley trope of like, oh, the founders and putting them<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:25">0:28:25-0:28:32</a>:</strong>  up on this pedestal and the journey they're going on.  You guys have largely avoided that.  Tell me about that decision and any regret on that or any exciting interviews you otherwise<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:32">0:28:32-0:28:48</a>:</strong>  turned down that you, you know, profile building you could have done?  No, no, I just I just think it goes back to the having the right values and the values  that kind of are important to your customers and that matter to your team and in your market.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:28:48">0:28:48-0:29:04</a>:</strong>  And, you know, I think so much of the Silicon Valley narrative when people raise money or  when people start companies is just founder obsessed.  For us, that's that's kind of just not who we are and it's kind of not our personalities.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:04">0:29:04-0:29:15</a>:</strong>  And we didn't really see the benefit in it.  You know, it's vastly more important to make sure that folks understand the problem of  our customers and the problem of farmers out there.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:15">0:29:15-0:29:27</a>:</strong>  That's generally the challenge of getting attention onto these problems versus getting  attention onto ourselves.  So in Silicon Valley or in the business press, you see very little about agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:27">0:29:27-0:29:40</a>:</strong>  I mean, there's really only a couple reporters at national publications like The Wall Street  Journal or Bloomberg or maybe Washington Post or somebody who kind of moonlights in The  New York Times might have a food person, but they don't have an ag person.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:40">0:29:40-0:29:52</a>:</strong>  And so they don't report on largely what's going on in rural America or rural Canada  when you get outside the ag trade publications.  And so the idea that those kind of publications or the business press or the tech press wants<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:29:52">0:29:52-0:30:09</a>:</strong>  to come in and wants to talk about VCs and founders is also kind of insulting because  there's a population out there who are our constituents or our customers and they have  very real lives and very real problems and are largely ignored.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:09">0:30:09-0:30:19</a>:</strong>  And it's one of the reasons why you've got these big urban rural divides in America,  socially and culturally.  And you know, I think it's one of our jobs to get focus on them.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:19">0:30:19-0:30:27</a>:</strong>  And then if we can get focus on them from a media and from a policy standpoint, then  we're helping the problem.  So I don't know, that's kind of also a big part of it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:27">0:30:27-0:30:42</a>:</strong>  It just feels like, you know, look in our constituency, it's just not there.  It's not the right thing to do to be sitting there and collecting accolades versus going  out and trying to get the attention on the problems of consolidation and lack of transparency<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:42">0:30:42-0:30:55</a>:</strong>  and lack of competition, the oligopoly pricing power, the struggles that farm families face.  Have you ever gotten pushback on that from investors who are like, hey, you know, you  really need to be building the profile of the company more or getting into, I don't<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:30:55">0:30:55-0:31:06</a>:</strong>  know, more tech crunch or whatever silly things they might want you to do?  Not really.  I would say, you know, mainly because, you know, I think a lot of companies and in Silicon<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:06">0:31:06-0:31:19</a>:</strong>  Valley, I think one of the reasons that a lot of that happens is that it's for fundraising  or for future fundraising and it's for profile building.  And it's kind of also for marketing and how companies get marketing early in the life<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:19">0:31:19-0:31:28</a>:</strong>  of the company.  You raise the series A and you get on tech brunch and you get an article and there's  the standard picture of two guys with their arms crossed and their backs together, you<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:28">0:31:28-0:31:31</a>:</strong>  know, looking at a picture at a window.  Right.  And you look that way.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:31">0:31:31-0:31:45</a>:</strong>  And that has become a trope.  And I think it just it serves a purpose in certain markets.  It serves a purpose when you're a tech platform trying to generate users quickly and the other<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:31:45">0:31:45-0:31:53</a>:</strong>  users are folks in Silicon Valley.  I think it's not just not doesn't matter to our customers and our members in the same  way.<br />

They want to know why you're doing what you're doing.  They want to know what the company is all about.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:02">0:32:02-0:32:09</a>:</strong>  That's the story we want to tell.  And that's the story we tell as FBN.  And FBN must be doing something right, at the very least in the eyes of investors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:32:09">0:32:09-0:32:20</a>:</strong>  It's one of the most well-funded ag tech startups.  And the recent raise announcement, a 300 million dollars series G brings their total funding  to more than eight hundred and seventy million dollars with a valuation just shy of four<br />

The round was really tremendous.  As you mature and you get through many rounds of funding, getting to the stage of having<br />

When you go through a fundraise, especially in the early days, everything kind of stops  for several weeks, several months.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:03">0:33:03-0:33:10</a>:</strong>  Fundraising can be a giant distraction.  Yeah, definitely.  We talk about a like post-raise hangover that happens when the whole team sort of shifts<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:10">0:33:10-0:33:16</a>:</strong>  focus in the early days to focus on the fundraising.  Then you've got to get back to running the business and all these things that you said  weren't as important.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:16">0:33:16-0:33:22</a>:</strong>  You've now got to make important again.  And that shift can be pretty challenging, but obviously wouldn't be the case at your  guys' scale.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:22">0:33:22-0:33:32</a>:</strong>  So one of the other aspects of the raise was the collaboration with ADM.  Tell me a little bit about this collaboration.  What are some of the benefits of it and what does this mean?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:32">0:33:32-0:33:45</a>:</strong>  Yeah, so this is really exciting.  So first of all, FBN is now at a scale where we have about 34,000 farmer members around  the US, Canada, Australia, and an increasingly sophisticated technology called FBN Gradable,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:45">0:33:45-0:33:57</a>:</strong>  which is a platform that a grain buyer can use to transact, settle and perform record  keeping around grain transactions.  And then a farmer sells to the Gradable system via the FBN app.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:33:57">0:33:57-0:34:07</a>:</strong>  So for a farmer, they can use it to sell grain as well as manage all their transactional  record keeping.  Now, Gradable does something else, which is that it also integrates with FBN analytics<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:07">0:34:07-0:34:20</a>:</strong>  and therefore contracts sustainability attributes associated with the crop.  So a big part of what we're focused on with ADM is developing sustainable markets for  grain, developing more premium end markets for low carbon, for carbon credits, as well<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:20">0:34:20-0:34:29</a>:</strong>  as for other premium attributes and environmental services that can be associated with the crop  that can be tracked and managed through the Gradable platform.  So it's really tremendously exciting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:29">0:34:29-0:34:41</a>:</strong>  So that's a major, major focus is doing sustainability at scale.  Then there's some other really exciting parts as well that we're going to be working on  looking at how we bring out, which would be bringing more ADM product on the input side,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:41">0:34:41-0:34:54</a>:</strong>  their fertilizers, nutrition, animal health, animal feed products out to our members.  And a lot of those products and inputs are very tied to the point of manufacture.  So they can be difficult to ship, very costly to ship.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:34:54">0:34:54-0:35:10</a>:</strong>  And so you need to have manufacturing close to farmers to make them as affordable as possible.  So that's another one where by providing and having access to the infrastructure of ADM  behind the FBN e-commerce platform allows us to serve more farmers closer to their farms<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:10">0:35:10-0:35:21</a>:</strong>  at much more affordable levels and pass on more savings back to the farm.  Yeah, it is so true of like ag tech, right?  That there's so many things you can do with digitization and in the digital world, but<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:21">0:35:21-0:35:31</a>:</strong>  ultimately we're talking about a physical world where you've got to grow things and  transport them and store them.  And so I think a lot of our commentary on the ag tech space as a company and as a podcast<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:31">0:35:31-0:35:39</a>:</strong>  has been around the, like you can't eat software, but you need both.  And that's, what's exciting about the future.  Did you imagine all along that you would have a partnership like this?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:39">0:35:39-0:35:47</a>:</strong>  Some of the early FBN kind of approach was around disrupting the system versus partnering  and working with it.  Has that philosophy changed at all?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:47">0:35:47-0:35:58</a>:</strong>  Well, I don't think the philosophy's really changed much at all.  I mean, we're very, very focused on farmers and how do we make farmers more profitable  and how do we make them more profitable with the power of the network?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:35:58">0:35:58-0:36:08</a>:</strong>  And sometimes that means a very deep disruption of parts of the agricultural system.  And sometimes that's done in collaboration, certainly with farm financing, you need financing  partners.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:08">0:36:08-0:36:16</a>:</strong>  If you're going to be selling grain, that's got to go to a physical facility.  You do need off-taking partners and merchandising partners in the market.  You need logistics partners.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:16">0:36:16-0:36:28</a>:</strong>  So you do have to partner in agriculture, but ag is very large.  And I think one thing people have said about the fundraiser, oh, is FBN not disrupting  anymore?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:28">0:36:28-0:36:38</a>:</strong>  I said, absolutely not.  If anything, this is tremendously exciting because we have a great partner in ADM supporting  the mission of FBN, the technology and platform of FBN and how we work with farmers to drive<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:38">0:36:38-0:36:50</a>:</strong>  even more benefits to the farm.  So I think the combination is much stronger and much more capable of doing that disruption  at scale, which is tremendously exciting for the benefit of farmers and for the benefit<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:36:50">0:36:50-0:37:01</a>:</strong>  of a competitive ag market, which is what farmers need.  Has that been the response from farmers?  Well, I mean, I think you've seen some of that in some of the ag press, but that's different<br />

And I think farmers understand that, hey, I got to sell my grain somewhere.  My grain's got to go to a facility and they understand that.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:10">0:37:10-0:37:17</a>:</strong>  And by the way, this doesn't preclude us from working with others in the market, especially  on the merchandising side.  So we have many partners.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:17">0:37:17-0:37:28</a>:</strong>  We've been of a deep partnership with Poet Ethanol for their facilities around sustainability  as well that has been in the works, that we've been had for some time.  So ag is broad and farmers' needs are broad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:28">0:37:28-0:37:43</a>:</strong>  So you have to be adaptable as a company to figure out how you best serve your customer.  But carving out new markets and partnerships hasn't always been easy for FBN.  Like in Canada, as I said before, the Competition Bureau is investigating whether the big seed<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:43">0:37:43-0:37:54</a>:</strong>  and chem companies have been boycotting FBM.  And as a relatively new player in the very well-established ag scene, Charles says his  team soon figured out they had to take control of the company's story.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:37:54">0:37:54-0:38:07</a>:</strong>  You know, relying on other folks to carry your message.  In some of the early days of FBN, we were going to go speak at some conferences or some  actually trade associations or grower associations who invited us to come speak.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:07">0:38:07-0:38:16</a>:</strong>  We'd send them our presentation, you know, because we talk about consolidation and competition  and price transparency in the market.  And they say, you can't say this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:16">0:38:16-0:38:23</a>:</strong>  You can't present that at our event.  And we'd say, well, what do you mean?  And they'd say, well, you know, these are our sponsors.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:23">0:38:23-0:38:29</a>:</strong>  You can't talk about this.  And I said, well, what does that have to do with your members?  Your members are all farmers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:29">0:38:29-0:38:35</a>:</strong>  And they said, well, no, we don't want to deal with that.  And you know, these are our sponsors, our sponsors will be upset.  So no, you can't say this.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:35">0:38:35-0:38:45</a>:</strong>  So we didn't go to those events and speak.  So it was really kind of eye opening.  You thought, you know, that all parties, you know, have the same interest for farmers and<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:45">0:38:45-0:38:53</a>:</strong>  communicating issues openly and transparently to farmers.  And it's just simply not the case.  So that led us to say, all right, we need our own event.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:38:53">0:38:53-0:39:02</a>:</strong>  We need our own conference.  We created farmer to farmer, which we ran up until COVID and hope to bring back here  this year with thousands of farmers coming because you needed an independent voice.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:02">0:39:02-0:39:11</a>:</strong>  Where you could speak directly to your customer.  We did our own publishing and did our own writing.  So there are just, you know, many cases where you think, well, obviously everyone's going<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:11">0:39:11-0:39:20</a>:</strong>  to see the world the way we do because these things are very obvious when you look at the  data.  But no, there may be many, many conflicting interests in that system.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:20">0:39:20-0:39:30</a>:</strong>  Another great one, you know, early on was similarly is you kind of, you want things  to be easier than they are.  I think this is an easy, easy trap for early entrepreneurs to fall into.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:30">0:39:30-0:39:40</a>:</strong>  You want, you hope there's going to be a big distribution deal that makes everything easy.  You're going to build your software and someone else is going to sell it and they're going  to do the hard work to getting it out to the farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:40">0:39:40-0:39:49</a>:</strong>  And so we had some funny examples in the early days where we were building our analytics  platform, which is our first product.  And we'd had some co-ops who were really excited about it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:49">0:39:49-0:39:57</a>:</strong>  They say, oh, the seed finder technology, this is great.  We want all our members to be able to see this.  We'd say, OK, great, you know, let's we'll go help you sign them up.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:39:57">0:39:57-0:40:04</a>:</strong>  They say, well, there's one big condition.  We only want them to see the products that we sell.  We don't want to see any of the competing products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:04">0:40:04-0:40:10</a>:</strong>  We only want their data.  You know, if they share data, we don't want them to see what's working on products that  we don't sell.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:10">0:40:10-0:40:20</a>:</strong>  Well, that kind of defeats the entire point of F.B.N.  It's an open system with crowdsourcing and farmers get to learn from others participating  and it makes everyone better off when that happens.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:20">0:40:20-0:40:31</a>:</strong>  So so very quickly you realize, OK, well, those folks, you know, they're not going to  be able to communicate to growers what needs to be communicated.  You know, we had a seed company who saw it was incredibly excited.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:31">0:40:31-0:40:36</a>:</strong>  They said we want this, you know, all our customers to have it because our products  are performing well in F.B.N.  Seed Finders.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:36">0:40:36-0:40:44</a>:</strong>  They said, print us up fifteen hundred brochures and for our sales meeting in two weeks and  we're going to get all our all our customers on F.B.N.  Seed Finder.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:44">0:40:44-0:40:48</a>:</strong>  They have to see this.  So, you know, we you know, this is in early days of the company.  We didn't have a brochure.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:48">0:40:48-0:40:59</a>:</strong>  You know, you go make a brochure, you know, spend a bunch of all nighters, you know, pulling  together some 20 page marketing brochure, print up fifteen hundred copies.  I don't think a single one of them ever got to a farm.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:40:59">0:40:59-0:41:13</a>:</strong>  And it just goes to, you know, the story of you know, you really just can't rely, especially  in the early days, on someone else to tell your story.  If your story has something that is about it, that's very unique, very special and you<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:13">0:41:13-0:41:25</a>:</strong>  care about your message more than anyone, then you have to build that connection with  your customers and with your members and with farmers one on one.  And when you rely on other people to do it, it's just never going to get there in the<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:25">0:41:25-0:41:31</a>:</strong>  way you want it to or you need it to.  Those are great examples.  Thank you for sharing.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:31">0:41:31-0:41:41</a>:</strong>  You raise a broader point around agriculture is I mean, obviously it's the best industry  in the world or else, you know, we wouldn't be working on it.  We obviously both love it and are really passionate about it not having come from it.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:41">0:41:41-0:41:54</a>:</strong>  One of the interesting things I find is how do you strike this balance between absolute  appreciation, admiration and inspiration of why it works the way it does and understanding  that, you know, you do need facilities and that there are generations of experience and<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:41:54">0:41:54-0:42:04</a>:</strong>  that is really tough and complex and absolute respect for that with also being able to question,  you know, why things are the way they are and we might need to do them differently or  challenge the status quo.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:04">0:42:04-0:42:18</a>:</strong>  Is that kind of tension something that you've felt or does that resonate with you?  Well, I think there's certain realities of moving physical goods around like in agriculture  where these are you know, you're shipping things.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:18">0:42:18-0:42:26</a>:</strong>  Those things often weigh into tons.  If you're dealing with commodities or feeds or hay, you know, that's low value and it  has to go be conveyed in certain ways.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:26">0:42:26-0:42:35</a>:</strong>  So there's certain physical realities in farming.  You can't get around.  But in terms of and there's a lot of reasons why the industry has evolved the way it has,<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:35">0:42:35-0:42:45</a>:</strong>  but some of those are due to intellectual property and licensing that has allowed companies  to control markets like seed.  But I think, you know, as far as for challenging the status quo, you have to look at the customer<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:45">0:42:45-0:42:59</a>:</strong>  and you have to look at the farmer and see, you know, when you look from the outside in  and you say, why on earth is there a market the size of seed and chemical that has no  prices online and that where products can't be distributed across, you know, are sold<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:42:59">0:42:59-0:43:06</a>:</strong>  across county lines without these zone pricing rules?  That's absurd.  And from a consumer standpoint, it's outrageous.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:06">0:43:06-0:43:16</a>:</strong>  And so the farmer, the industry may have evolved for certain reasons, but that doesn't mean  that it's right.  And that doesn't mean that it exists in a way that really truly benefits the farmer<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:16">0:43:16-0:43:23</a>:</strong>  from a consumer standpoint as a consumer and their needs as a consumer.  So that's really important.  You just have to keep your customer front and center.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:23">0:43:23-0:43:29</a>:</strong>  And that that keeps you focused on the right thing.  Thank you.  That makes a lot of sense.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:29">0:43:29-0:43:35</a>:</strong>  There's some big trends in the industry.  You mentioned carbon and obviously sustainability is one.  I would say two others that we've been talking about a lot.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:35">0:43:35-0:43:45</a>:</strong>  One would be like biologicals and new forms of inputs.  And the other one might be around autonomy in various degrees, whether that's retrofit  or partial automation or moving into full automation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:45">0:43:45-0:43:56</a>:</strong>  How are you seeing those trends evolve and any comments on on FBN's role in either of  those two trends or shifts?  I think there's a lot of exciting trends, especially around automation, robotics on<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:43:56">0:43:56-0:44:08</a>:</strong>  the farm and what that's going to bring, how quickly exactly they get out is, of course,  the issue.  If you were having this podcast seven years ago, it would have been primarily around drones.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:08">0:44:08-0:44:18</a>:</strong>  And everyone was talking about how drones would be a 90 billion dollar market.  I mean, literally, the drone industry said it was going to be a 90 billion dollar market  in agriculture back in 2013, 2014.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:18">0:44:18-0:44:31</a>:</strong>  So, you know, very hard to hard to predict how these things actually get adopted.  But fundamentally, they all have to prove their their ROI and utility onto the farm  and to the farmer, make it easy and very easy case.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:31">0:44:31-0:44:43</a>:</strong>  I'm particularly excited about some of the robotic applications I've seen.  There's a great company, Burrow, who brought their robot to farmer to farmer.  They found tremendous early adoption in the fresh market and fruit and vegetable crops<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:43">0:44:43-0:44:57</a>:</strong>  by focusing on very simple applications and very simple utility applications of a robot  that can follow a worker and help a worker pack and be more labor efficient.  That's a much more straightforward task than trying to build a fully autonomous tractor<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:44:57">0:44:57-0:45:06</a>:</strong>  system from the outset.  So I think there's going to be a number of incredible innovations.  There's no doubt that these are coming and that these are going to get onto the farm<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:06">0:45:06-0:45:15</a>:</strong>  over the next decade or two decades.  And we want to be testing them with our growers at the forefront of it.  You know how quickly they take off really depends on how well those technologies prove<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:15">0:45:15-0:45:22</a>:</strong>  the ROI on the farm so that the farmer feels the true return and has the willingness to  pay.  Awesome.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:22">0:45:22-0:45:34</a>:</strong>  So I know we're at a time here, Charles, but would you say you're as bullish on ag as you  ever have been and as excited, you know, if you zoom all the way back to the beginning  of the conversation, your first time on a farm, kind of being fascinated by this complex<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:34">0:45:34-0:45:40</a>:</strong>  industry.  Are you glad that you've ended up in agriculture?  And are you going to spend the rest of your career working in this space?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:40">0:45:40-0:45:51</a>:</strong>  Oh, absolutely.  I mean, I think the future is probably, you know, it's never been brighter from a technology  standpoint and from a lot of the business innovations that we've been able to bring<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:45:51">0:45:51-0:46:02</a>:</strong>  out there.  So I think you go back to when we were created, when we started huge problems in consolidation,  huge problems in anti-competitive behavior and huge problems in the lack of transparency.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:02">0:46:02-0:46:14</a>:</strong>  Those are all things FBN has taken head on sometimes to a lot of controversy in the industry,  not controversial with farmers, but controversial with the incumbents, which tends to be the  right equation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:14">0:46:14-0:46:25</a>:</strong>  You don't want to be controversial with your customers, but you want to be if the incumbents  are your persona non grata with the incumbents, that means you're doing something of value  for your customers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2021/11/28/later-stage-agtech-startup-lessons-3-farmers-business-network#t=0:46:25">0:46:25-0:46:34</a>:</strong>  You may have seen the information on the various anti-competitive actions against FBN in Canada  by the incumbents.  But, you know, FBN has been able to have a real impact on the market.<br />

We have changed the way some seed is marketed and sold by our seed relabeling work that  affects and can benefit all farmers, whether or not they're an FBN member or not.<br />

We've been at it eight years, but I think we're still going to be eating food a hundred  years from now.<br />

And that's it for another episode of Ag Tech So What.  A big thank you to Charles and congrats on the recent raise.<br />
