  <h1>Investing Beyond The Farmgate With Ben Barlow New Edge Microbials</h1>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:00">0:00:00-0:00:11</a>:</strong>  Hello, and welcome to AgTech So What, brought to you by the AgPente Group.  I'm Sarah Nolet.  Right now, there are a lot of existential threats facing global agriculture.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:11">0:00:11-0:00:23</a>:</strong>  Climate change, shifting consumer preferences, growing and aging populations, human health  concerns, the list goes on.  But there's also conviction that solutions exist, and that more are on the horizon, if<br />

And we know that to develop a biological product, it costs many millions of dollars, it needs  to be supported by science and takes probably five to seven years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:00:37">0:00:37-0:00:48</a>:</strong>  So unless we get cracking now, I think we're going to have a distinct disadvantage on the  global marketplace by 2030.  That's Ben Barlow.<br />

But Ben started out as, and continues to be, a farmer.  In addition to growing crops, Ben and his family have been investing in businesses around<br />

He's turned growing up in agriculture and a life in ag banking into a portfolio of investments<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:08">0:01:08-0:01:19</a>:</strong>  that are as much about the future of his farm as about the future of farming writ large.  But let's start at the beginning.  All of this work began when Ben first wanted to come back to the farm after college.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:19">0:01:19-0:01:30</a>:</strong>  When I finished uni, things were fairly tough in agriculture in Australia.  There were really high interest rates and commodity prices were terrible.  And that was in the early 90s.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:30">0:01:30-0:01:39</a>:</strong>  And my old man actually said, go and get a job.  So I went and became a bank teller in Mildura.  And from there, I had a really good career in banking, particularly agribusiness.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:39">0:01:39-0:01:51</a>:</strong>  And that led me to Sydney.  And then after that, that led me to the United States for a while.  And then after about 20 years in it, I decided that it would be time to go back to farming.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:01:51">0:01:51-0:02:02</a>:</strong>  But in that 20 years, my wife and I put together about 80,000 acres of hay.  So we had an operating business up there that we'd been running from a distance for many  years.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:02">0:02:02-0:02:13</a>:</strong>  So we went from high in corporate life to living in the lead them at Burleyville.  And that was great for a few years.  And then we sold that to a corporate investor and then made various agricultural investments<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:13">0:02:13-0:02:25</a>:</strong>  after that, which was about six years ago.  When you were working in the banking world, especially in agribusiness banking, I always  think that bankers have such a unique view on agriculture, talking to a lot of different<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:25">0:02:25-0:02:34</a>:</strong>  owners and operators and different financing models and different operating models, different  decisions.  They're in some pretty deep and personal business conversations.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:34">0:02:34-0:02:49</a>:</strong>  What were some of your insights or lessons from that time in banking?  Well, it was a great career because it traversed credit and marketing and developing the agribusiness  platform that we built in the United States.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:02:49">0:02:49-0:03:05</a>:</strong>  And you learn a lot about what makes a business work well.  I think because you see such a wide variety across your desk over a long time, you start  thinking about where the good opportunities are and why people are successful.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:05">0:03:05-0:03:17</a>:</strong>  And predominantly there's opportunity everywhere.  I think it's actually the culture and the people that come in behind a venture that  create the real value and momentum.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:17">0:03:17-0:03:29</a>:</strong>  I often say we do a lot of things that a corporate would do in a family company.  We do this profiles, for example, in all our staff and 360 feedback as you would in a corporate  operation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:03:29">0:03:29-0:03:47</a>:</strong>  Our systems are all geared as you would in a public company, in-house counsel, analyst  capability, all the things you need to stay on top of the game.  But really it's the understanding of the leadership team and operation of one another that it<br />

If you know your own self a bit and you hire people that compliment your shortcomings or  looseness, I call it, it really adds to the success and it can be marketed well, but you've<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:04">0:04:04-0:04:16</a>:</strong>  got to have substance underneath.  What have the conversations been like as you talk about whether it's a disc profile or  having company values, some of these things that, especially in agriculture, can seem<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:16">0:04:16-0:04:25</a>:</strong>  maybe a bit squishy or a bit too corporate, like hasn't always been the way things have  operated.  Have you gotten any pushback from people you've looked to hire or work with?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:25">0:04:25-0:04:36</a>:</strong>  No, we don't.  Everyone we've hired at sort of a company principles, if you like, are fairly grounded  and earthy and the way we operate is long-term and strategic.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:36">0:04:36-0:04:49</a>:</strong>  We're not driven by the investment cycle today.  We might be one day, but we'd be ready for that.  It's more in sort of the serious fun, I call it, in the business where there's a culture<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:04:49">0:04:49-0:05:00</a>:</strong>  of being open and having fun with one another and then achieving some pretty amazing things,  which requires a lot of time, a lot of long hours and focus.  That's what attracts people.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:00">0:05:00-0:05:06</a>:</strong>  I was only thinking about this the other day.  I was looking at the staff, particularly at NEM and the structure here.  We're an Ag company.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:06">0:05:06-0:05:15</a>:</strong>  We're 50% male, 50% female.  The leadership team's 50-50 and the average age is probably under 40.  That's across the whole operation.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:05:15">0:05:15-0:05:24</a>:</strong>  It's about creating opportunity.  Ag is a bit sexy now, I must say.  It attracts good talent and I think COVID's helped too, Sarah, by some very good people<br />

So we've really benefited from that.<br />

What were your observations looking back in on Australia from overseas or anything you  said, oh, we're really doing that well, really doing that poorly, looking outside in?<br />

It's an area of trying to develop an international business.  I was based in the Midwest, so I guess the Midwest is very similar to regional Australia.<br />

The learnings I've had from it is that it's difficult to run a business on the other side<br />

Now, was it when you were in the US that you started to develop this idea of a kind of<br />

I've always thought we should do that only because I think there's some really good regional  businesses around the place that are unique.<br />

I think what drew me to it was I went to Israel in about 2016, I think it was, and I was looking<br />

And I came back and I thought, gee, that looks really interesting.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:07:23">0:07:23-0:07:36</a>:</strong>  I wonder if there's anything in Australia that is like that.  And so I did my research, as you would normally do, and there was only one company really  of any substance in this space, and it was here in Albury, which wasn't far away from<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:07:36">0:07:36-0:07:50</a>:</strong>  where we relocated to.  So I met the owner who's still a shareholder and on the board, and we spent about 18 months  together looking at the company and working together and seeing if we like one another.<br />

So we did a structure whereby some of our family members came in, Sandy retained some  equity and with a pretty clear strategy, we invested a lot of money on global research<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:08:04">0:08:04-0:08:14</a>:</strong>  about where we sit in the global marketplace and what we could potentially do with it.  And that led us to acquire it and get credit.  So I've always been curious to look at outside investments.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:08:14">0:08:14-0:08:29</a>:</strong>  And it just happened to be that when I was in Israel, I thought investments that have  high barriers to entry in agriculture, which is strong and particularly in the biological  space, which is growing because of consumer sentiment is somewhere where I think we should be.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:08:29">0:08:29-0:08:38</a>:</strong>  I was going to ask why a biologicals business versus you said you were looking at irrigation  and other inputs.  What really drew you to biologicals?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:08:38">0:08:38-0:08:47</a>:</strong>  What really took me there was it's a difficult business.  There are really high barriers to entry.  There's proprietary strains and proprietary formulations, and there's also really strong<br />

So all those provide pretty strong barriers to entry.  To start a biologicals business, knowing what I know now, I think it costs several tens<br />

It's probably better to look at it in that context and say it's a great business.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:09:06">0:09:06-0:09:17</a>:</strong>  It's in a good space.  How do we actually transform the business to take advantage of global trends?  And if you look at what's going on around the world now, you know, you look at the growth<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:09:17">0:09:17-0:09:31</a>:</strong>  in biologicals, it's growing at 15 percent compound annual growth every year, maybe more,  depending on where you read it.  So if you're not growing at 20 percent as a business, you're probably not keeping pace.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:09:31">0:09:31-0:09:43</a>:</strong>  And that's about where we pitch this business.  We were probably 90 percent domestic three years ago, and that's changing to be the balance  is changing to international domestic.<br />

<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:09:55">0:09:55-0:10:10</a>:</strong>  We're expanding now with our research projects into cereals and all seeds and corn and chasing,  I guess, the bigger, addressable markets.  Our products today, right now, we service about 800 distributors here and abroad.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:10:10">0:10:10-0:10:19</a>:</strong>  And on the last count, I think annual production treats about a bit over two million hectares  of legumes a year.  So that's a really good base from which to grow.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:10:19">0:10:19-0:10:35</a>:</strong>  We have some formulation techniques which allow us to traditional inoculants for legumes  would be in three litre bottles or two kilogram packs to treat a tonne of seed.

So that's given us a global advantage and an intercontinental advantage where we can  put a lot of value on the air freight pallet and have it overseas within 48 hours, as opposed<br />

A challenge, of course, is to run the business really well.  And run our research and development programs really well that I think are these new frontiers.<br />

I look at the EU saying chemical and fertiliser applications have to reduce by 25% by 2030,<br />

But I look at the Australian system and I say we might wake up as farmers and find that  our clean ingredient image here in Australia is no longer the same in terms of chemical<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:11:44">0:11:44-0:11:57</a>:</strong>  residue or our carbon footprint.  And we know that to develop a biological product costs many millions of dollars.  It needs to be supported by science and takes probably five to seven years.<br />

And that's what drives me, Sarah, to head down this path to underpin our farming operations<br />

And what are the conversations like, Ben, about that with farmers, customers, whether<br />

Is it accepted or resistance or what are you hearing?<br />

So we've actually surveyed a large cohort of farmers, agronomists and distribution to  understand that sentiment.<br />

<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:12:55">0:12:55-0:13:09</a>:</strong>  in and they're getting more and more expensive.  There's an appetite there, but there's also a skepticism of it.  I think that's been because there's been a lot of attempts made to put biologicals<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:13:09">0:13:09-0:13:27</a>:</strong>  into the marketplace that haven't been underpinned by deep science because the companies that  do it just don't have the resources.  I think some data Sarah had, there were something like 530 biological companies around the globe.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:13:27">0:13:27-0:13:39</a>:</strong>  There were only, I think, about 22 that turned over more than 10 million US and the majority  of them didn't turn over much at all.  So they don't have the resources to spend several million dollars a year on R&amp;D like<br />

And I think that's the advantage.  We've been supplying our farmers now for 20 years with legume inoculants that they know<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:13:47">0:13:47-0:13:57</a>:</strong>  work.  The stats are really simple.  The inoculation of legumes in Australia saves the equivalent of about $5 billion worth of<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:13:57">0:13:57-0:14:12</a>:</strong>  synthetic nitrogen being applied a year or produce the equipment of 3 million tonnes  of nitrogen a year in an Australian cropping system.  So we figure that if we invest really heavily in science and we can actually produce<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:14:12">0:14:12-0:14:24</a>:</strong>  something that works in the bigger crops and it works in the Australian cropping system,  which we understand and not try and change it, then we've probably got a pretty good  opportunity that they might accept new products.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:14:24">0:14:24-0:14:40</a>:</strong>  But we have partnerships with certain universities and CSIRO and CSIRO does all our independent  assessment of what we're doing.  And we've taken the decision that when we go into trials in next year with some cropping<br />

A lot of companies produce their own data and sometimes they might do a number of trials<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:14:53">0:14:53-0:15:00</a>:</strong>  and only present the results from the best ones.  So we're going to do something different and we're going to produce the results from all  of them.<br />

And I think that's the only way to go.<br />

It's about being transparent and taking time and doing it properly.  And I think that also means that we're saying we're serious about it.  We're not rushed to get a product in a box by a certain time because our investors want<br />

And we've got time on our side to do a really good job of this.  And that's what we intend to do.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:15:32">0:15:32-0:15:43</a>:</strong>  Yeah.  What's your sense, Ben, of there's been quite a few, many millions now spent in the venture  capital world on different companies with biological solutions of different kinds, some<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:15:43">0:15:43-0:15:57</a>:</strong>  out of Australia and some overseas, and they would have some of that pressure around timelines,  yet they also have potentially deeper pockets in the near term, different kinds of resources.  What's your view on the entrance of venture capital into this space?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:15:57">0:15:57-0:16:06</a>:</strong>  I think capital into this space speeds the process up.  It's how you apply the capital, isn't it, at the end of the day and what you seek to  achieve.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:16:06">0:16:06-0:16:21</a>:</strong>  If I categorise the firms in this industry, there are those that have a biological that's  got promise in the laboratory and they're raising capital.  That's long, long way from the laboratory to being in a box and producing it at scale<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:16:21">0:16:21-0:16:35</a>:</strong>  and getting it across 70% of the market.  A long way, many millions of dollars and years.  There are a few companies that can take a strain, if you like, at the bug and research<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:16:35">0:16:35-0:16:47</a>:</strong>  it through hothouses, through trials, formulate it and get it in a box industry to the market.  There's probably only 10 of those companies in the world that have the full suite from  one end to the other.<br />

But I often wonder what happens after that, Sarah.  If you discover it and it works, then what happens after that?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:16:58">0:16:58-0:17:08</a>:</strong>  I guess it's a licensing model for them to license that technology around the world or  to sell it.  For us, it'll be to actually produce it at the end of the day.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:17:08">0:17:08-0:17:20</a>:</strong>  If you see changes to how those value chains work, like some of the big chemical manufacturers  are looking more at biologicals, you've got different agronomy groups doubling down on  advice around the use of biologicals.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:17:20">0:17:20-0:17:34</a>:</strong>  You've got bigger farms bringing in-house agronomy, dealers bringing in-house agronomy.  How do you see the landscape of that kind of go to market and confidence and advice changing  as we shift to more biologicals?<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:17:34">0:17:34-0:17:46</a>:</strong>  I think the issue is if you want to go direct to farmers, it's a long slog to sell volume  and you need a big sales force to go farmer to farmer.  The only way to do it with scale is through distribution.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:17:46">0:17:46-0:17:57</a>:</strong>  The ag distributors around and they're very skeptical and want to see the data and the  science.  And so in order to get into those big markets, you've got to produce the data and I guess<br />

Hence why I think the work we've got to do in this new frontier has to be really transparent  and validated by third parties in order to have acceptance.<br />

What are some of your lessons around partnership?<br />

And yet in reality, forming a partnership that's mutually beneficial is pretty challenging  in my experience.<br />

<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:18:48">0:18:48-0:19:06</a>:</strong>  Our scientific partnerships, for example, have been formed by acquiring what is what  I've turned well-researched material that's been researched over the last 30 years in  Australian universities, but haven't been able to be commercialised for one reason or<br />

All the paper was published, there was no commercial appetite to do it.  I'll give you the idea of partnership in science is to actually to acquire that intellectual<br />

And in that, agree that we'll pay a percentage of our revenue back to further research.<br />

It transcends time and it's in for the long run.  It's good for the company because we've acquired the IP.<br />

And the reward, of course, is further research funding coming back.<br />

It's more products that we develop going to the hands of our existing farmers or new<br />

It's really simple as easy to understand, but quite complex underneath.  But that's what we do.<br />

I always think that those are insightful lessons to share for others trying to grow<br />

Doing things urgently that we probably didn't think about or research well enough.  I think the other mistake we made too, is we were growing very fast and we didn't have<br />

But once we bolstered that up, that helped.<br />

But we do put a pretty rigorous matrix over the business.  When we're thinking about applying capital, we look at applying it where we get the best<br />

And we're pretty strong on that.  We're governed by a board, which we've appointed to keep us on the straight and narrow.<br />

But our R&amp;D model is we took a different direction to a lot of companies who spent gazillions  on R&amp;D.<br />

You mentioned something that piqued my interest around working on the business instead of  in the business.<br />

Is there anything that you as the leader do in the day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month  to make sure you're working on the business instead of in the business?<br />

It's just a day where I just say, this is the day where I just sit and think about things  and pick up the phone and talk to the team on bits and pieces, what's on their mind.<br />

Keep the strategy really simple and stay focused on it.  It's so exciting to charge up and down dry gullies and look at new things.<br />

That's the best advice I can give anyways.  We can spend days and days and months and years trying to get the killer strategy.<br />

Another one is on antibiotic stress and dealing with getting high yields in dry climates and  dry situations.<br />

And the last one is to find a way to release phosphorus, which is what all the big companies  around the world like us are trying to do.<br />

And I think they're the ones that farmers will embrace because they understand it really<br />

So they're the big opportunities for us.  There is no doubt the world's view on carbon is going to change the agricultural landscape.<br />

And the writing's on the wall, I think, for where we're going.  And I see that as not a threat.<br />

So I think farmers are great innovators in the main and particularly the leading farmers.  It's the sort of stuff that I think will be adopted.<br />

So all this technology theoretically should help us maintain our competitiveness.  So bring it on, I say as quickly as possible.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:46">0:30:46-0:30:59</a>:</strong>  Ben's experience offers a lot of insight into not only the biological space, but also  the intersection of production, agriculture and entrepreneurship.  In the biological space, this market is growing fast and its pace is accelerating.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:30:59">0:30:59-0:31:11</a>:</strong>  Investing in deep, sound science and transparency with farmers, combined with carefully controlling  shipping and logistical constraints, all with an eye to the global marketplace, has been  an effective strategy for New Edge so far.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:31:12">0:31:12-0:31:24</a>:</strong>  For founders out there, Ben's advice to know yourself and your weaknesses, or as he says,  looseness, is what is really necessary to hire the right team, which is the source,  in his opinion, of a company's value and momentum.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:31:24">0:31:24-0:31:34</a>:</strong>  This work goes to strategic partnerships as well, where Ben's advice is to go slow and  ensure you're well aligned with your would-be partners, from operators in your global network  to university researchers.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:31:35">0:31:35-0:31:46</a>:</strong>  And for farmers who are interested in investing beyond the farm gate, the realization that  diversifying an ag portfolio with businesses less affected by the seasonality and cyclicality  of production is a key one for Ben.<br />
<strong><a href="https://www.agtechsowhat.com/agtechsowhatepisodes/2022/23/ben-barlow-new-edge-microbials-biologicals-agriculture#t=0:31:46">0:31:46-0:31:57</a>:</strong>  Beyond that, investing in solutions that he can use has given Ben a way to shape the kinds  of technologies that would help his own farm and in that way stay ahead in a rapidly changing  world.<br />
